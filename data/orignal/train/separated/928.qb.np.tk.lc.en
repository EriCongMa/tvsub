gaby &apos;s new tenant ...
i understand you got a room to rent. we like you .
if you have first and last months &apos; rent ,
we &apos;d like you even more . ... came with a dangerous secret .
i &apos;m your father . wayne &apos;s return meant trouble for katherine .
she doesn &apos;t know you , but i do .
did you have anything to do with the fire at rick &apos;s restaurant ?
lynette tried to warn tom about kayla ...
i think we have a seriously troubled young girl .
and in his time of weakness ,
orson chose the wrong shoulder to cry on .
i don &apos;t ... think ...
you &apos;re right .
the incident-- as it would come to be known--
happened late on a tuesday afternoon .
witnesses included an old woman ...
a blind man ...
and a young boy .
the old woman , whose hearing was not what it used to be ,
saw bree hodge emerge from her house
in a way that told her
she was upset about something .
the blind man , whose hearing had become more acute ,
heard edie say ... oh , hey , bree. what &apos;s up ?
... in a way that suggested
edie wasn &apos;t expecting any trouble .
the young boy , who was not yet 11,
heard bree hodge say ...
i saw you kissing my husband .
but he couldn &apos;t understand
why someone would be angry about kisses ,
which he thought grown @-@ ups liked .
as the old woman pretended
to clip hedges she &apos;d already clipped ,
she saw the body language of her neighbors change .
as the blind man listened in ,
he heard bree say ...
what were you thinking , edie ? we &apos;re supposed to be friends .
we are friends . i am not interested in orson .
the young boy then heard edie add ...
so stop acting like such a bitch !
... which included a word he was not allowed to use .
the old woman then saw bree hodge clench her fist .
a second later , the blind man heard a slap ...
and the young boy saw edie grab her cheek .
as the two women parted company ,
a thought occurred
to all those who had witnessed the incident ...
that right there on peaceful wisteria lane ,
the battle lines had been drawn ,
and someone ...
was going to get hurt .
it happens the second sunday of every may .
children purchase tasteful bouquets ...
sign sentimental cards ...
and create homemade jewelry ...
all in an attempt to honor
that woman known simply ...
as mother .
hey , mama. hey , baby .
oh , my gosh !
is this my daughter @-@ in @-@ law ?
well , i &apos;m gonna hug her. oh ! it &apos;s nice to meet you .
oh , my goodness ! oh !
oh , okay .
oh , my son was right .
you are the prettiest thing !
michael , i &apos;m just taken with her .
oh , well , good. thank you. come on , mama. let &apos;s get you unpacked .
oh , yes , let &apos;s do , &apos; cause i brought you a present. oh ! oh !
let &apos;s go. come on .
it &apos;s all recipes .
not just any recipes .
some of these have been in my family
since before the war of northern aggression .
you mean the civil war ?
i mean what i mean .
um , well ...
i guess mike didn &apos;t tell you
that i &apos;m , uh , really not a cook .
oh , no , he told me .
that &apos;s why i gave you these recipes ,
and i &apos;m gon &apos; teach you how to make &apos; em , too .
isn &apos;t that nice , honey ?
oh , my meemaw always told me
that a lady should be a chef in the kitchen ,
a maid in the living room and a whore in the bedroom .
and michael says you &apos;ve only got one of those covered ,
so i &apos;m gon &apos; help you with the other two .
excuse me .
the one she won &apos;t be helping me with--
please tell me it &apos;s &quot; whore . &quot;
i call the computer. no way ! i called it on the bus .
whoa ! whoa , whoa , whoa ! guys , wait a minute. wait a minute .
there &apos;s somebody i want you to meet .
this is dr . dolan. hey , guys . i &apos;m joshua .
he &apos;s gonna hang out and watch us ,
you know , be a family .
why ?
because we &apos;ve had a couple of ...
problems lately .
and my job is to find out what &apos;s causing those problems ,
and then i can help you be a stronger family. can we be a stronger family
while playing &quot; age of empires iii &quot; ?
yeah , sure . i wanna learn how to play that game .
go get started . i &apos;ll join you in a minute .
so i like what you said
about making the family stronger ,
but as i told you , kayla &apos;s the one you wanna focus on .
well , i prefer to look at the big picture .
you see , if a family is dysfunctional ,
it can lead to a child with problems .
yeah , or a child with problems
can lead to a dysfunctional family .
i mean , kayla &apos;s the one that got my kids to light a fire
and jump off the roof. honey , it--it sounds like
dr. dolan has , um , kind of a plan here .
i understand. it just seems like ...
at $ 140 an hour , we could skip straight to the part
where you sit down with kayla
and tell her to stop being so evil .
mommy ?
yeah ? um ... i forgot to give you something .
oh. it &apos;s a drawing i made for you in school .
oh , well , thank you. it &apos;s beautiful. thank you .
she never does this .
mmm. don &apos;t. we &apos;re waiting for ellie .
she &apos;s finishing up with a customer .
well , maybe when she &apos;s done tattooing him ,
she can put &quot; stop hitting the blind guy &quot; on my forehead .
you know , i &apos;ve been hitting you a lot less lately ,
and i don &apos;t feel
like i &apos;m getting enough credit for that .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m a bad husband .
no , seriously .
we &apos;re getting along better. have you noticed that ?
yeah , i think it &apos;s because of ellie .
me , too. it &apos;s impossible to argue with her in the house .
she makes us laugh .
she takes you off my hands every once in a while .
plus , she &apos;s always helping around the house .
i mean , yesterday , without even being asked ,
she washed all the windows .
she &apos;s amazing . i don &apos;t know where she gets all her energy .
okay , so we &apos;re square .
dude , you gotta call me next week .
i got some great stuff coming in. all right .
ellie , it &apos;s getting cold ! i &apos;ll be right down !
so should i sneak out the back ?
oh , no. that &apos;s my landlady. she &apos;s cool .
she knows you &apos;re dealing ?
well , she &apos;s not that cool .
oh , hey , guys !
you were up there a while. can i see it ?
um , she-- she means the tattoo .
i would love for you to see it ...
but it &apos;s kind of down south .
oh , on his ... got it .
does it hurt ?
it &apos;s okay .
ellie gave me something for the pain .
and fairview has a top @-@ rated school district ,
which , uh ...
you &apos;ll appreciate in a couple of years .
well , come on in . i &apos;ll show you the inside. you go ahead , honey .
i &apos;ll wait until mark wakes up from his nap .
all right , we &apos;ll see you in a minute .
okay. all right ...
hi ! oh , hi !
i &apos;m bree hodge . lauren baxter. nice to meet you .
so are you thinking of moving onto the lane ?
yes. this house is exactly what we &apos;ve been looking for .
do you mind if i ask-- is it a safe neighborhood ?
oh , yes , the neighborhood &apos;s safe .
i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent .
well , what do you mean ?
what is this ? you left it in the printer .
it &apos;s a house listing .
yeah , for a house in baltimore .
yeah , wait till you see it. it &apos;s got a pool and a garden .
this is about dad , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m doing this to protect us .
we don &apos;t need to be protected. he &apos;s changed .
it &apos;s all an act , sweetheart .
you don &apos;t see it now , but you will .
he &apos;s only back because he wants something .
i don &apos;t know what exactly . i just know we &apos;re not safe here .
oh , sure. that &apos;s it. dad has some evil plan .
it couldn &apos;t be that he wants to be in my life ,
that he loves me. he isn &apos;t capable of love , dylan .
i found that out the hard way ,
and we need to leave
before you learn the same horrible lesson .
move if you want .
i &apos;m staying here with my father .
but what happened ? things were going fine .
i &apos;m sorry. we need another realtor .
all right .
biscuits are the foundation of any southern meal .
like my meemaw used to say , &quot; ain &apos;t nothin &apos; you can make
don &apos;t taste better on a biscuit . &quot;
a fount of wisdom , your meemaw .
well ...
i really appreciate this. thanks , adele .
&quot; adele &quot; ? if you don &apos;t call me &quot; mama , &quot; i &apos;m gon &apos; scream .
don &apos;t do that ... mama .
now let &apos;s get started .
we &apos;re gonna need a flour sifter .
i don &apos;t have one .
pastry cutter ? sorry .
dough hooks ? don &apos;t even know what they are .
that &apos;s fine. we can improvise .
why don &apos;t you start by measuring out our dry ingredients ?
the flour and such ?
michael is gonna be so happy .
after a long day of work ,
he can come home to a nice , home @-@ cooked southern meal .
although he also enjoys
coming home to sesame chicken from red panda ,
and they deliver .
you know , it &apos;s a shame that michael has to work so hard .
but i guess with all the money troubles
you two have been havin &apos; ... he told you that ?
well , we &apos;re getting past it .
only because my son is working himself to the bone .
you know , it wouldn &apos;t hurt for you to get a job . i have a job .
oh , you mean your little drawings ?
well , it &apos;s great for a woman to have a hobby .
personally , i decoupage ,
but i &apos;m talking about something that pays .
children &apos;s books pay .
really ? how much ?
you know , i think , actually ,
i might have those dough hooks somewhere .
oh , dear . i &apos;ve insulted you .
now i &apos;m just trying to be helpful .
no , no. it &apos;s fine , adele .
mama .
so we were sort of surprised to get your call .
don &apos;t you need to see kayla a few more times
before you report back to us ? well , before continuing with her ,
i thought it might be helpful to ask you a few questions. oh , go ahead .
shoot .
do you love kayla ?
lynette ? hmm ?
i was talking to you .
oh. well ... s @-@ sure .
i &apos;ve been very good to her .
that wasn &apos;t his question .
do you have a diploma on your wall , tom ?
i don &apos;t think so. zip it .
again , um ...
do you love her ?
of course i do ...
as much as i can , given the way she joined our family .
it &apos;s just--it &apos;s complicated .
i understand. the problem is ,
kayla has picked up on your ambivalence ,
and she &apos;s become a very angry girl .
so what do we do ?
oh , god. is this gonna be one of those therapy things
where she hits me with a foam bat ?
there &apos;s a bond that develops
between an infant and her mother .
you and kayla never formed that bond ,
so what we need to do is recreate it .
it &apos;s called attachment parenting ,
and it starts with kayla being by your side
as often as possible .
that sounds like exactly what they need .
i mean , i don &apos;t have a diploma or anything , but ...
i &apos;d really like to give this a try .
whatever keeps you and kayla close and interacting--
go to the movies , go shopping ,
maybe take a little trip together , just the two of you .
could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second ?
the plan sounds great , doc. don &apos;t worry .
i will make sure that they are together constantly .
as me if i love tom right now .
go ahead . i dare ya .
may i help you ?
i haven &apos;t seen benjamin in a week .
i was thinking i &apos;d take him for a few hours. it &apos;s not really a good time .
well , bree , whenever i call , it &apos;s not a good time ,
so if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to take my son to the carnival. well , that sounds boring .
i know. why don &apos;t you take him to edie &apos;s house ,
and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue ?
bree , you don &apos;t understand .
what you saw was bad judgment on edie &apos;s part
and good judgment on my part . i pushed her away .
yes , eventually , with a big , dopey grin on your face .
can we please put this behind us ?
i would like to take benjamin . i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;d hate for him to be around
when you had another attack of delayed morality ,
either with edie or behind the wheel of your car .
i am not having this argument .
he is my son , too .
not exactly .
what ? don &apos;t even--
strictly speaking , you &apos;re not even related to him .
i mean , it was fine for you to masquerade as his father
when we were together , but now that we &apos;re not--
this is wrong . i will hire a lawyer .
i &apos;ve already hired one. you &apos;ll be hearing from him shortly .
oh , and if you &apos;re in the mood for a carnival ,
why not call edie ?
i hear you get three throws for a dollar with her , too .
bye , gaby .
you guys going for another walk ?
yeah. we found this sweet hiking trail--
goes right through the middle of the woods. yeah , and unlike some people ,
ellie doesn &apos;t let the branches hit me in my face .
you &apos;re spoiling him .
what the hell ?
ellie , your door is locked !
ellie !
oh , shut up already .
mom , guess what ?
dad &apos;s coming to my senior recital next week .
i could swing by and pick you up , if you want .
we could make it a real family outing .
dylan , your father and i need to talk ... in private .
i &apos;m not done saying good @-@ bye .
yes , you are. please get rid of that gum .
i can hear you smacking all the way in the house .
bye , sweetheart. bye , dad .
just so we &apos;re clear ,
there will be no family outings .
now , kathy , you shouldn &apos;t be rude
to a man who still has feelings for you .
meaning what ? you still love me ?
i do. and i know i &apos;m somewhat to blame
for what &apos;s happened between us .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter .
the least you can do is meet me halfway .
oh , wayne .
i don &apos;t deserve your forgiveness .
maybe not , but i &apos;m gonna give it to you anyway &apos; cause ...
i still think we could be happy together .
could we ?
given all the things i did
that you don &apos;t know about ?
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m talking about all those men i was with
while we were married .
how can you forgive something like that ?
that &apos;s a lie .
you wouldn &apos;t have dared .
unhappy women do dangerous things .
i think the worst
was when i tricked you
into thinking dylan was yours .
i wanted to tell you the truth , but i was scared ...
for obvious reasons .
i don &apos;t believe you .
but i &apos;m not worried anymore
because you &apos;ve changed .
so what are you waiting for , wayne ?
forgive me .
hey there ! mrs . mccluskey .
if she &apos;s not mine , then whose is she ?
does it matter ?
oh , i guess i won &apos;t be seeing you at the recital now .
hmm. what a shame .
are you sure it was cocaine ?
carlos , i was a fashion model in the &apos; 90s .
i know cocaine .
damn it .
what are you doing ? i &apos;m calling the police .
shouldn &apos;t we hear ellie &apos;s side of the story first ? here &apos;s ellie &apos;s side .
&quot; selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables . &quot;
there you go. were you moved ?
okay , look , maybe i was wrong .
maybe it was flour. maybe she &apos;s a pastry chef .
yeah ! and she came up with that tattoo cover story
to hide her illicit baking .
all right , look , i know we have to do something ,
but this woman &apos;s our friend .
yes , and i &apos;m a convicted felon still on probation .
now if the police find out we &apos;re harboring a drug dealer ,
they &apos;re gonna fry me. we have to turn her in .
well , the priority for me
is working out custody of benjamin .
to that end , i &apos;ve written down
all the pertinent facts about the situation .
no , i don &apos;t want to do this over the phone .
uh , listen . i &apos;m gonna hop in the shower .
how about we meet in your office in about an hour ? great. thanks .
orson ?
orson ?
the , uh , the door &apos;s open .
edie ? what are you doing here ?
get out here , you wuss .
that puritanical robot bitch of yours
is sabotaging my business .
okay , hang on a second . i &apos;ll be right out .
danielle and austin agreed to give us their baby
and allow us to pose as his parents .
you know , uh , orson ... forget it .
just--just take a nice , long shower .
really ? you sure ?
yeah. uh , now that i think about it ,
i can handle bree all by myself .
so that &apos;s when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed .
i mean , i @-@ i mean , i think it was cocaine ,
and i think they &apos;re called bricks .
i &apos;m just a simple housewife . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .
well , you &apos;ve done the right thing , and it &apos;s thanks
to the cooperation of citizens like you--
yeah , yeah , yeah. when are you gonna get her out of our house ?
well , it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
meaning ?
bullock !
oh , my god !
what ? what ? i can &apos;t see anything .
it &apos;s one of ellie &apos;s customers .
actually , i &apos;m detective bullock .
we &apos;ve been tracking miss leonard for several months now .
okay , so if you know what she &apos;s doing ,
then why don &apos;t you just bust her ? she &apos;s small @-@ time .
we &apos;re trying to get to her supplier ,
so we need her to keep dealing .
wait. so you &apos;re just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house ?
yes. for now we just need you
to act normal , pretend like you don &apos;t know anything .
we &apos;ll move in when the case is made. okay , look ,
i &apos;m all for doing my civic duty ,
but this woman-- she &apos;s ... sort of a ... friend .
and now you &apos;re asking us to trick her ?
i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re comfortable with this .
mr. solis , you &apos;re on probation , right ?
how &apos;d you like not to be ?
what on earth could you possibly want ?
oh , i wanted to thank you .
after you scared off that couple
that were going to buy the young house ,
i , uh , found another buyer ,
and they &apos;re willing to go 10 % over asking .
well , good , when they drop by for their inspection ,
i &apos;ll just have to have a nice little chat with them , too .
you wouldn &apos;t wanna do that to me .
and after all , we &apos;re family .
family ?
well , yes , since my nephew austin
is benjamin &apos;s biological father ,
that makes me benjy &apos;s great @-@ aunt--
a term i don &apos;t exactly love ,
but it &apos;s better than &quot; grandma , &quot;
which is what you are .
how did you ...
cute story .
i @-@ i went over to orson &apos;s to ask him to get you off my back ,
and the poor sap--
he--he &apos;d written the whole sordid tale down
and left it right there on the table .
edie , if word got out ,
my whole family would be ... humiliated .
oh , i don &apos;t want word to get out .
that would ruin everything , because right now i ...
well , i own you .
what does that mean ?
glad you asked .
from this moment on , i am your best friend .
you &apos;re gonna invite me to all of your fancy parties ,
set me up with all your single friends ,
and , well , if i &apos;m ever in the mood for muffins ,
you &apos;re gonna bake &apos; em for me .
edie ... please .
and if you don &apos;t ,
if for one second i don &apos;t feel the love ,
i &apos;m gonna bury you .
you understand ?
yeah .
good .
oh , by the way , um , i &apos;m having an open house tomorrow .
a plate of banana nut muffins sure would set the mood .
don &apos;t you think ?
hey , honey , could you get that ? thank you .
hey , bree , perfect timing .
we were just getting ready to deal the cards . bree , are you okay ?
there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been ... keeping from all of you ,
and , um ...
we need to talk .
hey , wayne .
i finished that d.n.a. you wanted .
i &apos;m probably gonna get in trouble
because i put it in front of martin &apos;s triple homicide .
you bad girl .
well , i owe you . i just needed to confirm
that the vic and my suspect are related. oh , well , actually , they &apos;re not .
i ran the samples from the cheek swab
and the wad of gum you gave me ,
and your suspect &apos;s not related to the victim at all .
are you sure ? mm @-@ hmm. oh , yeah , it &apos;s 100 % exclusion .
are you hungry ? &apos; cause i worked all through lunch ,
and i thought that you and i could go get--
wayne ?
oh , my god .
and edie threatened to use that to ...
yes .
okay , first of all , you &apos;re , like ,
the greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that .
thank you .
i can &apos;t believe she was blackmailing you .
i can &apos;t believe she made a play for orson .
i can. she went after carlos and mike and karl .
the only person she hasn &apos;t gone after is tom .
yet .
this woman is outta control .
what are you gonna do ?
no. what are we gonna do ?
hey , guys , what &apos;s going on ?
i told them everything , edie ,
about orson , benjamin ,
everything. you did ?
she did , so you can kiss
that little blackmail scheme good @-@ bye .
well , i was only doing it because--
you were only doing it because you &apos;re the devil .
okay , fine , chew me out and let &apos;s get on with it .
it &apos;s not like all the other times , edie .
we &apos;re done .
done ?
we &apos;re not inviting you to poker. we &apos;re not talking to you .
we &apos;re not even gonna wave when you jog by .
from now on , you are invisible .
and we &apos;re gonna make sure every woman in a 5 @-@ mile radius
knows the kind of crap you pulled .
we tried to be your friends , but you don &apos;t even understand
what that word means , so now we &apos;re gonna be something
you do understand .
guys , wait. wait . i know i crossed a line this time ,
and , well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
did you hear something ?
neither did i .
over here , honey , look at the camera .
look at the camera. you ready to ride , dylan ?
now look , if you &apos;re scared , you don &apos;t have to . i want to .
no , you &apos;re a brave girl .
hold up your arm for the camera , sweetheart .
how many stitches is that ? 11 .
and you didn &apos;t cry once , did you ?
can i ride now , please , daddy ?
of course , baby .
i love you , daddy .
dylan , it &apos;s me .
uh , you need to come over here tomorrow .
yeah , i know it &apos;s mother &apos;s day , but it &apos;s okay .
i got some things to tell you about your mother .
ooh , i want this one .
oh. yow ! it &apos;s a little pricey .
but i want it. you &apos;re the one who asked me to go shopping .
well , i know , but we &apos;re supposed to be spending time together ,
not going into debt .
how about this one ?
what do you mean , &quot; supposed to &quot; ?
i just ...
it &apos;s good for us to hang out . i enjoy it .
is this something that the doctor made you do ?
no. all my idea .
i just wanted to treat you to a real fun day .
all right. you want me to have fun ?
buy me this .
okay .
good times .
i &apos;d like an old @-@ fashioned , please .
what &apos;s the matter , michael ? you tuckered out ?
oh , yeah , i just didn &apos;t get much sleep .
honestly , i wonder how you ever get any ,
well , considering you got susan in the bed
sawing wood all night .
i &apos;m doing what now ?
snoring .
what &apos;d you say it sounded like , michael ?
a bunch of bulldogs in a bag ?
but it is a sound that i &apos;ve come to love .
you know what my meemaw did to grandpa boo ?
she sewed a marble in the back of his pajama top ,
then if he rolled on his back to start snorin &apos; ,
it &apos;d wake him right up. but i guess you can &apos;t do that ,
seeing as how you sleep in the nude and all .
well , that &apos;s gonna change real soon .
i &apos;m gon &apos; fix my face before i order. excuse me .
oh , this is nice .
nice ? she &apos;s driving me crazy .
you have got to stop complaining about me to her .
i don &apos;t ... complain .
well , you could see how i , as the nude , snoring whore ,
would think so .
okay , now i might vent a little bit ,
but she &apos;s just trying to help. well , the next time she tries to help ,
she &apos;s gonna get an old @-@ fashioned in her face ,
so you better step up and start defending me. okay , okay .
well , lovely powder room .
it &apos;s amazing that such a busy restaurant
can keep their bathroom cleaner than yours .
now , mama , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not very nice .
well , you &apos;re the one who told me
you didn &apos;t marry her for her housekeepin &apos; .
you just need someone to teach these things .
you know what ?
why don &apos;t i stay a few extra weeks ,
and you and i can spruce the house up ?
and don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll leave when the baby comes .
at my age , all that crying just cuts my nerves to shreds .
now the first thing we &apos;re gonna do ...
is wash your walls .
just &apos; cause we don &apos;t walk on &apos; em
doesn &apos;t mean they don &apos;t get dirty .
now how do you remember that ?
... science project. now when you used to read ...
oh , my god ! my water broke. what ?
my water just broke . i &apos;m in labor .
we have to go. you &apos;re not due for a month .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , mama. look at me .
aah ! come on. we have to get you to the hospital .
well , yes , let &apos;s go .
no , no , no , you should take a cab home and start packing .
this one feels like a crier .
well , are you sure i should--
aah ! aah ! come on .
you &apos;re doing great , honey. just keep breathing .
how close are the contractions ?
a few weeks apart. wanna go to the movies ?
what ?
i &apos;m not in labor , okay ?
but your water broke . i saw it .
that was club soda .
amniotic fluid doesn &apos;t have ice cubes and a lemon wedge .
what , you faked that ?
i &apos;m sorry . i panicked .
your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks ,
and you said nothing . i had to come up with a plan .
well , what happens if we go home with no baby ?
i didn &apos;t say it was a good plan .
do you see the effect she has on me ?
i just thank god i wasn &apos;t drinking coffee .
i could &apos;ve hurt myself. okay , i get it . i &apos;ll talk to her .

michael told me what a klutzy kathy you are .

mama , we need to talk .
about what ? about the way you talk to people .
i mean , um , sometimes you can be a little too ... honest .
sorry. go on .
it &apos;s just ... you don &apos;t realize how things sound
when they &apos;re coming out of your mouth .
i know you mean well-- ohh !
i &apos;m getting to it. no , no , no , i @-@ i love where this is going .
it &apos;s just that , mama , sometimes when you &apos;re talking to susan--
susan , you look a little pale. are you okay ?
oh , she &apos;s fine. and i wish she &apos;d cut it out .
no , i &apos;m not trying to--ow !
susan ?
are--are you going into labor ? for real ?
maybe. who cares ? let her have it .
okay , okay .
mama , you &apos;ve gotta stop taking potshots at susan .
she &apos;s my wife , and i love her ,
and i can &apos;t have you upsetting her .
sweetheart , i @-@ i am deeply sorry and mortified .
if--if i &apos;ve caused you any distress ,
i never meant to hurt your feelings .
apology accepted. let &apos;s go .
happy mother &apos;s day !
oh , my gosh !

again , i know i crossed the line ,
and i am so sorry .
you know what ? let &apos;s not get into this .
i &apos;m just gonna get angry all over again .
tom , if you had been there and heard what she said ...
it doesn &apos;t matter. you hit her .
honey , she &apos;s just a little girl .
and now thanks to you , she &apos;s a frightened little girl .
sorry to bother you , dr . dolan ,
but you said i could call anytime .
my mom ...
she hit me .
no , it &apos;s not the first time .
i was afraid to tell you
&apos;cause i knew what she would do if she found out .
please help me .
i don &apos;t feel safe here .
i have to go. she &apos;s coming .
uh , sorry about the mess. the maid took the week off .
you said you wanted to talk to me and ...
tell me things about mom ?
you know what , kiddo ? i @-@ i had kind of a bad day yesterday .
i sat around here drinking , feeling sorry for myself .
and ... and then i called you .
that &apos;s okay .
if you &apos;re feeling sad or whatever ,
you should always call me .
none of this is your fault . i hope you know that .
none of what ?
i tried so hard to let the past just be the past .
i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t wanna bring up
who did what to who or why .
what did mom say to you ?
and it turns out i &apos;ve been kidding myself all this time .
this family that i &apos;ve been fighting for--
it just-- it doesn &apos;t even ...
exist .
we don &apos;t need her .
i &apos;m fine with just you and me .
i &apos;m happy now .
ow ! dad , you &apos;re hurting me .
dad , what &apos;s the matter ?
you have to go .
what &apos;s wrong ? did i do something ?
get outta here ! now !
ellie ? brunch is almost ready !
this is gonna be so hard .
you can &apos;t think of her as your friend .
think of her as a drug dealer
who could &apos;ve gotten us into a lot of trouble . i &apos;ll try .
oh ! shoot .
i wanted to surprise you. what &apos;s this ?
well , you know , it &apos;s mother &apos;s day , and ...
i have kind of a crappy relationship with my mom ,
so ...
this is my way of saying thanks for being nicer to me
than she ever was .
oh , honey !
i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t get you the chocolates .
no , travers , no , i decided spending mother &apos;s day with you
is more important
than spending time showing people stupid houses .
oh , love you , too , sweetheart .
actually , i think mommy &apos;s gonna be spending
a lot more time with you from now on .
but we &apos;ll talk about that when i get there , okay ?
i love you , baby . i &apos;ll see you soon .
it happens the second sunday of every may .
we celebrate the women
who give us life ...
and so much more .
the ones who protect us at all costs ...
who have the courage to fight those who would do us harm ...
who put our happiness ahead of their own .
but mostly ...
we celebrate a mother &apos;s love ,
which is constant , eternal ...
and there from the very beginning .
