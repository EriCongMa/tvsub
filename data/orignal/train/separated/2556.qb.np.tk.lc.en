yes !
oh , china ,
is there nothing that can &apos;t be made in you ?
ah , my first sucker .
oh , a dollar .
now i can have lunch .
it &apos;s a trick !
i never needed these .
oh , lookie here ,
it &apos;s the ol &apos; fishing line on a dollar bill prank .
man , even a backwoods , no account , inbred ,
lead @-@ paint @-@ eating , kerosene @-@ huffing ,
roadkill @-@ chomping , um , what was my point ?
that is a practical joke , luann .
which is too bad , because i desperately need that dollar .
i could also use the fishing line to get some dinner .
bart , if milhouse is hiding with you ,
tell him he has to shop for school clothes .
yay ! school clothes .
this isn &apos;t right , no one &apos;s falling for my pranks .
at least it wasn &apos;t a total waste .
i found a quarter .
well , we sure got him good .
duh , what a moron , duh .
i sure wish archie was alive to see it .
it &apos;s thursday night , and that can only mean ,
counter @-@ intuitively , football !
from london &apos;s wembley stadium ,
the jacksonville jag @-@ u @-@ ars and tampa bay &quot; bucs &quot;
vie for florida bragging rights .
does not include miami .
* when you &apos;re not happy *
* watching your downton abbey *
* you can always see *
* football *
* not british football *
* but american football *
* which has higher scores *
* touchdown *
if these u.k. clichés are any indication ,
we are in for one gobsmacking match .
to see or not to see . that is no question .
dad , i &apos;m worried .
no one is falling for my pranks anymore .
son ,
i know this seems like the biggest disappointment of your life ,
but trust me , there are going to be so many more .
what you &apos;ve got to remember is--
oh , my god , 13 men in the field !
review it , review it , review it .
yes ! play stands !
here comes the airplane !
thanks to your late football @-@ watching ,
you missed breakfast .
eh , don &apos;t worry , marge , i &apos;ll make my own .
mom , i &apos;ve been working on a new solo jazz piece .
can i hear it ?
oh , i &apos;d love to stay and listen , but i &apos;m late for work .
here &apos;s another super @-@ fan to hear you lay down your licks .
brava .
i knew you &apos;d like it .
hey , i am too young to be over the hill .
lucky for me , there &apos;s a ralph born every minute .
hey , ralph , how about a napkin ?
do i look stupid ?
wall licorice .
marge , nothing says &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; better than flowers .
except for fundamental behavioral change ,
but you can &apos;t buy that at the supermarket .
they do smell nice .
hey , dad , want to hear my solo ?
i added a few variations today .
of course i would .
okay . aw , my reed is split .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;ve already heard lisa &apos;s song once .
i &apos;ve had a long day , and to be completely honest ,
i really can &apos;t stand jazz .
what about when lisa plays it ?
all the same .
sounds great , honey .
so , you really don &apos;t like jazz ?
i never realized we have so much in common .
and scat @-@ singing .
do i give a darn ?
so , all these years , you &apos;ve been lying to me ?
so , let &apos;s get it all out here .
mom , you were only pretending to like it this morning
when i played my funny valentine .
that was my funny valentine ? hoo @-@ boy .
wouldn &apos;t expect you to get it .
so busy juggling three children ,
you don &apos;t even notice when one is hanging by a thread ,
a thread you just cut forever !
lisa , this a family .
you do not take that tone with another family member .
you tell &apos; em , butterbean .
shut up , idiot .
lisa , honey , you &apos;re hurt ,
but hurting me back is not going to feel as good as you think .
just know that i am very , very sorry .
good night , marjorie .
marjorie .
she called me &quot; mar @-@ jo @-@ rie . &quot;
so ? bart calls me homer .
you know that &apos;s out of disrespect .
dis @-@ respect ?
is that a word ?
yes .
and there &apos;s this guy at work that calls me hoss .
what &apos;s that all about ?
this is awful .
lisa and i have always been so close .
now , for your first day at school ,
you get what my mother gave me .
pearls ?
just like mommy &apos;s .
dad , is there anything you pass along ?
predilection for kidney stones .
what if lisa doesn &apos;t want to be friends with me anymore ?
marge , it &apos;s not your job to be friends with your kids ,
it &apos;s my job . good night , sweetie .
oh , uh , bart and i
are gonna see an r @-@ rated movie saturday .
it has boobs , but they &apos;re elf boobs .
is that cool ?
hmm . i guess .
so long , whoopee cushion .
ah , good old peanut brittle .
what the ... ?
a coiled wire spring covered by a snake @-@ patterned vinyl sheath ?
lisa , our weekend in capital city will make us friends again .
i don &apos;t see your saxophone .
that must be a relief to you .
honey , i want you to bring it .
sure , should i grab some kenny g cds too ?
some chuck mangione ?
that would be lovely !
oh , i @-@ i get it , they &apos;re popular , so you don &apos;t like them .
just please get your sax .
airport shuttle ?
yes , i &apos;m going on a trip with a special little girl .
that baby is adorable .
oh , it &apos;s not the baby .
great , now i &apos;ve got both daughters mad at me .
may i say that you sound like a terrible mother ?
but no one ever cares what the shuttle bus driver thinks .
&quot; take me to terminal four , &quot; they say .
actually , we &apos;re at terminal three .
arguing with everyone today , aren &apos;t you ?
okay , we &apos;ll see you on monday , homer .
i &apos;m feeling really sad too , dad .
nothing cheers people up like a baby .

and i &apos;m gonna start with ...
ice cream !
come back !
don &apos;t make me jog .
why is your father chasing after the spay and neuter van ?
you got me .
what do i do with you ?
hey , this is fun .
i like having a sister .
helps that you don &apos;t say anything .
i wonder how you are at pranks .
we &apos;re not worthy . we &apos;re not worthy .
i &apos;m back !
don &apos;t drop that angel .
hi , folks , and welcome to the capital city dream tour .
if you &apos;re here for the capital city crime tour ,
that leaves in 20 minutes .
let &apos;s wave to that to that ordinary hot dog vendor .
wow , he &apos;s anything but ordinary .
you know , i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if he turned up one of capital city &apos;s broadway @-@ caliber shows .

* hey , g.i. jane *
* let &apos;s make it plain *
* how do you train for love *

i always like when a black guy teams up with a white guy .
it gives us hope .
that &apos;s the show for lisa .
she &apos;ll love it !
the bad news bears ?
is there nothing so beautiful
that they won &apos;t keep exploiting till it &apos;s worthless ?
well , they &apos;re expensive ,
which means if i die , you &apos;re still taking me .
also , i bought you a little present from a street vendor .
they &apos;re earrings .
he &apos;s a cool cucumber , huh ?
mom , i &apos;m really not into jewelry right now .
you &apos;re not wearing your pearls .
um , the clasp wasn &apos;t working .
i can fix it .
there are some things that can &apos;t be fixed .
what are you saying ?
you really don &apos;t understand
how much this has hurt me .
jazz is my thing , and you said you loved my thing ,
but you lied .
you &apos;ll have a daughter someday , too .
and when she yells at you like that ...
she &apos;ll be right .
oh , who can sit with their back turned
as their mother is crying ?
a jazz musician , that &apos;s who .
well , you guys understand .
don &apos;t look at me , i &apos;m a pity present .
i &apos;m just glad i &apos;m not in a salad .

hey , look at ol &apos; gil holding a baby .
i &apos;m not even dropping it .
oh ! why did i say that ?
now it &apos;s all i can think about .
oh , every time i get a great job , i drop a baby .
if i can just get her to share an armrest ,
that would be a start .
* a ragtag bunch of misfits *

&#91; 百老汇音乐剧 &#93;
oh , you were our star tonight .
that &apos;s a performance i &apos;ll never forget .
so what are you sophisticated ladies up to next ?
well , i thought we might have an after show nosh
at the penny loafer .
invitation noted and accepted .
well , good ,
because getting a table for three is so much easier .
hey ! you &apos;re not nathan lane !
here he comes .
aw , don &apos;t worry , bart jr . ,
daddy will get that for you .
why you little ...
dad , no ! you &apos;re gonna strangle a baby !
oh my god .
that would &apos;ve been horrible .
why you little ...
turning ...
a sweet little baby ...
into a you !
bart , you &apos;re a great kid ,
but if i had another one like you ,
i &apos;d hang myself from a highway overpass .
please , give your sister the precious gift
of not being you .
okay , dad .
mags , it was fun while it lasted .
i didn &apos;t know it was that easy .
stop that !
sideshow bob !
如果硬币是你偷的 请还回来
so , lisa , think we &apos;ll see any stars ?
mom , it &apos;s a tourist trap .
celebrities don &apos;t actually come in here .
until today , right ?
well , you never know .
i &apos;ll ask the hostess if anyone &apos;s expected .
aw , she keeps doing this .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
every time she tries to fix things between us ,
it just emphasizes how different we are .
for what it &apos;s worth , my mom loved your show tonight .
she pretty much sees the best in everything .
amazing , really ,
considering she has a husband who randomly shows up to work ,
a son who , god bless him , is probably heading for the chair .
and an ungrateful little girl
who ignores her mother &apos;s frantic attempts at reconciliation ,
and tells family secrets to a total stranger .
a total stranger the new york times calls
&quot; a charming presence . &quot;
you don &apos;t know me at all !
but hardly anybody likes jazz .
why should i expect my mom to ?
that &apos;s right , you have to see the other side .
the one that always makes you wrong .
mom .
mom , i can &apos;t stay mad at you .
i &apos;m putting my pearls back on .
oh , thank you , sweetie .
and i apologize for expressing my sincere feelings .
why don &apos;t you show us what you got , lisa ?
that &apos;s right , i learned your name .
it &apos;s not all about me , andrew rannells .
20 bucks for ten minutes with the sax .
hey , that little turd can play .
i &apos;m just getting warmed up .
* don &apos;t tell me not live *
* just sit and putter *
* life &apos;s candy and the sun &apos;s *
* a ball of butter *
* don &apos;t bring around a cloud *
* to rain on my parade *
my parade .
sorry .
* don &apos;t tell me not to fly *
* i simply got to *
* if someone takes a spill , it &apos;s me , and not you *
* who told you you &apos;re allowed to rain on my parade *
* get ready for me , love *
* cause i &apos;m a &quot; comer &quot; *
* i simply got to march *
* my heart &apos;s a drummer *
* nobody , no *
* nobody *
* is gonna rain on *
* my parade *
well , what do you think ?
my golden girl .
straight ahead is the the 19th street liquor store ,
the epicenter of the 1967 riots ,
which never fully stopped .
ahead is the high rise
where state senator wilcox was shot in mid @-@ air ,
as he plummeted to his death .
best trip of my life .
