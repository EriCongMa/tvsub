are you ready to run ?
i have my playlist all ready .
actually , it &apos;s diane keaton &apos;s autobiography ,
and she just filmed first wives club ,
and it &apos;s getting me pumped !
i totally forgot we were going to run today .
i e @-@ mailed you , like , three times .
maybe you typed &quot; gmoil &quot; again .
no more excuses-- we have to train .
we signed up for this charity run
and now we have to do it .
why can &apos;t we just donate the money ?
why do we have to run the six miles first ?
that &apos;s a good point , but , no , you &apos;re gonna go ...
oh , no , jess , look , i can &apos;t go .
i am super hungover right now .
plus , masha had a bit of a crisis .
she accidentally ate a cookie .
what ?
because she fell on it .
i am devastated .
she is devastated .
well , why don &apos;t you come running with us ?
no , she definitely can &apos;t .
you can run off that cookie .
it &apos;s great .
you know what ?
we will do it tomorrow , i promise .
it &apos;s more money for charity .
it &apos;ll be so fun .
i mean , that was a close one .
good thing i &apos;m a quiet breather .
i learned that as a kid
playing &quot; who passed out ? &quot; with my mom .
my mom always won .
jew in the couch , jew in the couch .
nadia , american manners .
sorry .
jew @-@ jew person in couch .
she &apos;s not wrong .
okay , bye , nick .
so you &apos;ll call me ?
um , yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll definitely ...
are you , are you okay ?
i &apos;m gonna call you .
um , okay .
do you hike ? do you hike ?
okay , i ...
this was fun .
okay , i &apos;ll call you tonight to make sure you &apos;re okay ?
please .
that was ridiculous .
i can &apos;t do this , winston .
i don &apos;t know how to sleep with 21 @-@ year @-@ old girls ,
and for the last couple weeks , that &apos;s all i &apos;ve been doing .
what &apos;s going on with you ? are you okay ?
i saw something a few days ago .
now , i &apos;ve been sworn to secrecy ,
but it is just too big .
i know what you are going ...
you know i can &apos;t keep a secret ,
i can &apos;t lie , winston .
you saw me with that girl .
don &apos;t leave me like this .
even thinking about keeping a secret
turns my back into a slip &apos; n slide . just leave me alone .
come on , man ,
you got to help me out , okay ? i &apos;m dying .
i don &apos;t want to know .
hey , hey , hey , come on , come on ...
i &apos;m dying ! i &apos;m dying , man !
i don &apos;t want to know .
i don &apos;t want to know !
cece and schmidt are sleeping together !
it &apos;s happening under our roof .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
this makes me hate things .
i know , man . it &apos;s like up is down .
up is the new down , man .
now my back is sweating .
all right , who knows ?
everybody but jess .
hey , jess .
we &apos;re just hanging out in the hallway .
what &apos;s going on ? nothing &apos;s going on .
yeah , actually , i &apos;m really annoyed .
cece bailed on me again .
we were supposed to train for that race this weekend .
that is so cece .
i know ... i mean ,
and the weird thing is that she said she was hungover ,
but last night she said she didn &apos;t want to go out .
maybe she had a guy over .
not like that-- i didn &apos;t say anything .
if you think about what i said , i didn &apos;t say anything .
you have a secret .
you have a secret .
no , you have a secret .
turn around .
you turn around .
let me see your back .
please don &apos;t .
just be cool about ...
ew , gross .
j &apos;accuse , miller , j &apos;accuse .
you fold like a lawn chair .
fold , fold .
yes , you--
fold , fold , fold , fold , fold , fold .
winston told me cece and schmidt are sleeping together !
come on , man !
what ? !
oh , my god .
they know , schmidt .
sweatback ?
you told sweatback ? come on , winston .
jess .
god .
i am so sorry that you had to hear about this like this .
but , i mean , can we just take a moment to celebrate me ?
schmidtty really did it this time .
i mean , i &apos;m having indian every night .
no , no !
jess , i &apos;m really sorry you found out this way ,
okay , but trust me , it wasn &apos;t some big conspiracy .
it was just something that happened
and then it got out of control , sort of like poison oak
and i just couldn &apos;t stop scratching it .
cece started it .
that &apos;s ...
i did , i started it .
why , cece ? are you trying to get back at your parents ?
when did it start ?
jess , i want to emphasize
that we are not dating .
i can &apos;t stress that enough .
this is just sex .
mm @-@ hmm , when did it start ?
3 a.m. , february 15,
right on schedule .
two months ago .
two months ?
two moons have passed since you started doing it ?
why do you start talking like a native american
when you get angry ?
two moons have passed !
just a quick sidebar .
uh , we &apos;ve done it in every room of the apartment .
ugh , even my room ?
just the one time .
oh , god .
how long have you known ?
a few days .
you didn &apos;t tell me either ?
jess .
just as a reminder , i told you seconds after i found out .
because you &apos;re weak , nick , weak .
okay , i agree . just chill out . stop yelling .
jess , i want to tell you everything .
what do you want to know ?
i don &apos;t know , cece .
how would i know if you &apos;re telling the truth ?
come on , jess .
are you seriously mad ?
no , no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m really glad you two are having fun .
how cool is that ?
for what it &apos;s worth
i think what i did was really brave .
get off of me .
yeah .
hey , have you guys seen a scarf ?
holly said she left it out here .
it &apos;s my favorite scarf
because it &apos;s a circle ,
so you never have to think about
which end goes on the right or the left .
my therapist gave it to me .
she &apos;s asian , but she &apos;s the nicest .
who is that ?
nobody , just ...
who was that ?
was it that stuck @-@ up bitch
from last night with the fake hand ?
no , it was no one .
it was just ... it was just beep @-@ beep @-@ beep .
was ...
i &apos;m so old .
i don &apos;t even know how to use a cell phone .
come on . let &apos;s go clubbing . you want to go clubbing ?
show me the phone .
let &apos;s go back to when we were having fun .
let me see the phone .
no , just chill out .
let me see your phone .
no !
smooth .
i &apos;ll call you .
nick , are you kid ... ?
what , you keep the ringer on ?
amateur move , man .
yeah , i &apos;m just in over my head .
schmidt , i hate asking you this , but how do you do this ?
oh , glory be , are you asking for my help ?
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m flattered .
pull up , pull up , nick . yank back on that yoke .
we have to face the reality of the situation .
schmidt has been having consensual sex with cece
and lying about it .
he &apos;s better than us at this , winston ,
and i hate it as much as you do ,
and , schmidt , i hate saying this ,
but i might ...
i might respect you .
thank you for saying that .
you &apos;ve come a long way , man .
since my 20s , i &apos;ve had a string of lesser paramours which ,
like weathered stone steps , have led me to the hindu temple ,
a.k.a. cece , because she &apos;s indian .
you don &apos;t have to be so gentle with me .
all right , oh , that &apos;s how i like it , baby .
all right .
sex , man . it &apos;s the real stuff .
i don &apos;t know that i should help you .
you &apos;re not a player .
you &apos;re a clingy serial monogamist with--
well , with a terrible metabolism .
schmidt , i need you ...
... to teach me to be a douchebag .
let &apos;s get to work .
what &apos;s happening in the world ?
hey , babe .
oh , hey , cece .
doing some stretches ?
good guess , model .
no , just limbering up in case i want to have sex
with one of your roommates .
do you want some company ?
what ?
do you want some company ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t hear you .
diane keaton is talking about her rich life full of loyal friends .
oh , jess ,
i hate when we fight . i get so stressed out .
i mean , my eye twitches back .
i &apos;m eating bread , all right ?
just let me come on this run with you .
no !
seriously , jess , it was just one secret .
everybody has got secrets .
good afternoon .
uh , my name is mr. schmidt . m @-@ r ...
not even a real chalkboard .
first of all , nick , congrats .
thank you .
you &apos;re meeting a lot of young women ,
and for whatever reason , they seem to ,
you know , find you appealing .
in the restaurant of life ,
you have selected the tasting menu .
okay , i changed my mind . i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
nick , you &apos;re terrible at lying ,
so what we want to do is , we want to focus on
s.s.v.
i cannot believe you slept with cece .
short , simple ...
vagina .
vague . it &apos;s actually ... it &apos;s actually vague .
let &apos;s apply it .
i &apos;m one of these young girls that &apos;s coming in here .
i want to party . i &apos;m in college . let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;m in .
hey , what happened to your phone ?
jesus took it .
a jesus hawk on a speedboat .
the environment .
bears , family , magic .
i need your help , schmidt .
yeah .
i &apos;m the girl , and the whole objective
is to get me out of the front door
as fast as you possibly can .
let &apos;s do this .
ready ?
yeah .
what &apos;s your name ?
my name is janine , all right ?
god .
don &apos;t make that sound .
good morning , nick .
you really gave it to me good last night .
you gave me the full business , yeah .
this is really weird , schmidt .
it &apos;s one of the weirder things we &apos;ve done .
right ?
what you thinking , brown eyes ? want to grab some brunch ?
sure , janine , that sounds fun .
god-- no , you don &apos;t want to grab brunch .
okay .
come on , damn it , nick .
i &apos;m all turned around .
focus .
i just had sex with janine .
i have feelings for her .
yeah , so you &apos;re done .
oh , i just sleep with her and then kick her out
like she &apos;s a piece of meat ?
this is the problem .
all right , ask me again , schmidt .
okay , cowboy , want to saddle up and go again ?
no , sweetie , i can &apos;t .
good-- why can &apos;t you ?
i got things to do . i got plans .
you have work .
plans can be canceled .
i don &apos;t want to live in a house of lies .
i can &apos;t do it anymore .
is this happening , too ?
no , this is not happening . no , this is not happening .
this isn &apos;t what it looks like .
okay , look , fine , from now on , we are going to be open
and honest in this loft ,
and that means that
i have some secrets i want to get off my chest .
i &apos;d rather not hear those .
nobody wants to hear these .
schmidt , a couple months ago
i found nick using your chenille throw as a napkin .
that is a microfiber blend from pakistan , you heathen .
stop quoting the catalog like a weirdo .
good , this is healthy . air it out .
all right , one more .
schmidt said that winston is in danger
of becoming a nanny for life .
he said you were going &quot; full poppins . &quot;
okay , winston , i can see anger in your eyes .
schmidt said he thinks about you sometimes
when he &apos;s making love to himself .
what ?
one time .
what ? !
i thought about bangs
and your face just appeared beneath them .
okay , by the way ,
like i &apos;m the only one .
nick told me it happened to him ,
like , like , a bunch of times .
winston ,
you told me the first week you got back from latvia ,
you had a sex dream about jess ,
and she had raccoon hands .
dreams do not count .
you &apos;ve all thought about me
while self @-@ completing ?
yeah .
yeah .
look , jess ,
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
really , it &apos;s ,
it &apos;s the sincerest form of flattery .
we &apos;re going back to keeping secrets .
when i walk through this door and into my room ,
this conversation never happened .
oh , my god !
so , what did the raccoon hands look like ?
oh , man , they were digging through the garbage .
oh , my god !
do not drink my almond milk
when you spent the whole night drinking schmidt .
jess , why are you dressed like a mexican wrestler ?
because cece ,
i don &apos;t want to live in a world with secrets .
and that means that i now know
my three roommates have all thought about me
while self @-@ completing .
so , i &apos;m gonna wear my winter clothes
until i can deal with that fact .
but it &apos;s better than not knowing .
is it really better ?
yeah , it is .
jess , i don &apos;t want to fight with you anymore , okay ?
i said i was sorry .
we tell each other everything . we always have .
i &apos;ve never not told you something .
that &apos;s what second base means ?
then i &apos;m not a virgin anymore .
is it weird that he wants me
to talk in a deep voice and call myself kevin ?
i had a dream that i killed you .
you tell me everything , all right ?
i stopped telling you everything
because every time i did ,
you got so judgmental and critical .
what ? !
i had to give it a try , jess .
i mean , that was the same hand that was inside elmo .
cece .
okay , yeah , you got me .
you don &apos;t have secrets , jess ,
because you never do anything stupid .
look at me !
with guys .
so , living with spencer for six years was not a mistake ?
cece , i &apos;m not judging you .
it &apos;s just ... schmidt ?
judging . see what that is ?
no . i &apos;m not judging until now .
don &apos;t look at me !
oh , jess , would you please !
a winter hat is not gonna make us stop thinking about you
from time to time when we delight ourselves .
oh , no !
hey , could you guys keep it down ? i have a lady visitor .
hi , nick .
oh , i get it .
it &apos;s actually kind of a fantasy of mine .
can you say the following words out loud ?
&quot; the ice roads are too dangerous !
you &apos;re gonna have to turn back , chief . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying that .
okay .
i want my scarf .
it is 62 degrees out , and i am freezing .
no . i had work . i @-@ i have plans . i ...
get in there ! come on !
can i just pay you for the scarf ?
fine . $ 25 .
$ 25 ... ! no , i &apos;ll just help you look for it .
nick , where &apos;d you go ?
are you kidding me ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s a bear .
there &apos;s a magic bear in there !
that &apos;s all . it is ... is a magic bear .
just stop . just ...
hey , nick .
who is this ?
can i have this circle scarf ?
it &apos;s my scarf .
no .
it &apos;s my scarf ! it &apos;s mine !
it &apos;s mine ! it &apos;s mine !
nick , i just want you to know
that i am not judging you right now .
oh , yeah . right , sure .
ladies , let &apos;s not do this .
at least not with our shirts on .
do you know how many things i haven &apos;t told you ?
no , i don &apos;t , because , apparently ,
i don &apos;t know you at all .
are you running a 10k tomorrow ?
who knows ?
are you even against ms anymore ?
beats me !
they &apos;ve stopped hitting each other ,
and they &apos;re just hitting me !
all right , you want to go ? this new year &apos;s ,
i wasn &apos;t at my parents &apos; house .
i was down in st. barths
with a guy who might be an arms dealer .
and my feet aren &apos;t whiter than yours .
i just told you that to make you feel better .
and when we were ten years old ,
i went to the movie my girl
with jessica p before i saw it with you !
and ... i own a motorcycle .
jessica p ? !
jessica freaking p ?
oh , my god , are you crying under there now ? !
no ! no !
i think you are .
no , i am not .
all right , everybody stop !
wherever you are right now , just sit down !
okay , now , saturday
is a day for sleeping ,
and damn it , you will not take that away from me !

finders keepers is not a thing .

you &apos;re at the prime of your life . that &apos;s actually ...
cece , get rid of the motorcycle !
and jess ,
don &apos;t act like you haven &apos;t thought about us , too ,
when you &apos;re going solo .
okay ? i don &apos;t work a 9 : 00- to @-@ 5 : 00 . i &apos;m here all day .
i can hear you !

that is cece &apos;s water !
you animal !
this thing with our girls has gotten out of control .
our girls ?
yeah , it makes me really sad
to see them fighting over me like this .
then why are you smiling ?
have you guys ... seen ... cece ?
yeah , she &apos;s way down there . hasn &apos;t even broken a sweat .
jess , okay . jess , arms up .
arms up .
i need you long and loose like sea grass .
moving . move ...
oh , my god , why ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just mad at you .
my adrenaline is going .
did you make that ?
what ?
and cece let you wear it ?
what ? she thought it was funny .
cece ! cece ?
cece !
what &apos;s that about , man ?
i mean , i think the shirt &apos;s pretty funny , no ?
not funny at all .
puns are creepy ,
and they freak me out , and you know that .
i like it .
nick !
oh , no , no , no .
i hooked up with both those girls last week .
i didn &apos;t know they knew each other .
i thought they just lived in the same apartment .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you hooked up with my roommate ?
i don &apos;t ...
willow , i didn &apos;t call you
because i had a family emergency .
is everything okay ?
yes , it is .
and megan , i didn &apos;t tell you about willow because
the moment we had was so beautiful and intense ,
that for a second i thought
we were the only people on the planet .
oh . okay .
well , we &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
bye , guys .
it worked .
where did that come from ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m trembling , but it worked .
that was so good my pants just got tight , nick .
oh , god , now i hate me as much as i &apos;ve always hated you .
skin .
see , i have to do this now .
no , you don &apos;t . don &apos;t do it .
yes , i do .
skin .
all you have to do is just not do it .
i have to . no , because it works .
cece ? cece , i can &apos;t ... breathe .
cece , i know why you didn &apos;t tell me about schmidt--
because you like him !
what ? !
the shirt , cece .
you thought the shirt he made was funny .
you obviously like him .
it &apos;s the only explanation for thinking that &apos;s funny .
oh , my god , i think you &apos;re right .
and you didn &apos;t want to tell me
&apos;cause you knew that i would know .
and you weren &apos;t ready to admit it to yourself .
okay , can we just say that i didn &apos;t tell you
because i &apos;m a total bitch ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m way more comfortable with that .
oh , maybe i like schmidt .
you ... you can &apos;t tell anyone .
yeah . that &apos;s like a secret only i know .
heads up . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m peeing .
oh , my god .

all right , there we go . lead us away .
good job , jess .
real proud of you .
what are you doing to that basil , cece ?
you trying to make it confess ?
easy with the knife , robespierre .
i will cut off your weaker fingers , schmidt ,
and i &apos;m gonna start with your pinky .
you guys are adorable .
we are not adorable .
okay ? we are just two people having casual , successful sex .
my bad .
please .
all right .
i can &apos;t stand this heat .
i gonna get out of the kitchen .
you should really stretch , jess .
you know , jess thinking that we &apos;re a cute couple is ...
i don &apos;t ... it &apos;s kind of a turnoff .
how do we explain to her that this is just ... it &apos;s just sex ?
what is that ?
that is shoddy workmanship is what that is .
i &apos;m taking you off prep .
go clean the garbanzo beans .
i &apos;m taking my knife .
be careful with that knife .
it &apos;s from japan .
why ? why , cece ?
why am i sleeping with schmidt ?
is it a pity thing ?
is he sick ?
are you working for the government ?
damn it , he &apos;s holding you against your will , isn &apos;t he ?
if he is holding you against your will , blink twice .
blink twice .
are you tired of being turned on ?
you have a mole fetish ?
is it huge ?
i &apos;m sorry . let ... let me phrase that .
