she &apos;s prone to depression , frankly .
mmm . i mean , not that i have any regrets .
no , no , course not , she &apos;s a good kid .

beppy , tommy ... come on .
you &apos;re the only one i can trust over there .
and believe it or not , it &apos;s important to me that he &apos;s cared for .

some men in a cadillac . he was mowing a lawn on kimball street .

little carmine , he was my father &apos;s friend !
philly , joey , look ... okay , okay , okay .

i &apos;ll do anything you want . i &apos;ll suck your cock , okay ? all of you guys !

shut up .
please , guys .

adios , you fucking skank .

come on .
take as long as you like , no rush .
i &apos;ve got my &quot; times crossword &quot;
and agnes here will get you anything you need .
thanks , mel .
so how &apos;s it being home , angelo ? enjoying living with your daughter ?
it &apos;s like paradise . i eat like a pharaoh , i got my own room , cable tv .
i have cable . -my grandson
he asked me ... he says , how come he never met his grandpa before ?
i said , &quot; because grandpa &apos;s been in special forces . &quot;
first he was afraid of me ,
but i said , &quot; come on , we &apos;ll get some ice cream . we &apos;ll go to the park .
it &apos;ll be ... -well anyway
here we all are .
right .
i called you boys because lorraine calls me and she said
there &apos;s a situation in our family that &apos;s gotten outta hand
with john and little carmine .
this fucking johnny , he wouldn &apos;t even let the maggots get on carmine
before he &apos;s telling me to kick up direct to him .
problem is carmine never named a successor .
we all assumed it &apos;d be johnny
&apos;cause the son &apos;s down in miami with the discos and the whatnot .
he &apos;s grabbing with both hands , john . this could get ugly .
there &apos;s a lotta potential for bloodshed .
potential ? they almost killed us .
jason , men are talking here .
now you &apos;re close to john . you have any ideas ?
what are you asking him for ?
he never even had the makings of a varsity athlete .
your point being what , junior ?
oh , forget it , he &apos;s just breaking balls .
all right , one thought i had in the interest of harmony ,
maybe there could be a power @-@ sharing situation .
the sopranos have two bosses .
that &apos;s not all it &apos;s cracked up to be
believe you me .
let &apos;s not get into that right now , okay ?
what i was thinking was three bosses , a triumvir @-@ thing , like caesar .
little carmine , johnny and you .
i &apos;m retired .
you were carmine &apos;s consigliere for over 30 years .
if it wasn &apos;t for that construction beef down in yonkers ,
it &apos;d be you running that family today .
things happen how they happen .
think about it .
doesn &apos;t have to be 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 . you could still take your grandson to the park .
things get heavy , you &apos;re just another voice to weigh in .
and john still does better financially than he ever did under carmine .
there he is . salvatore , my dali .
my aunt told me about it .
i mean , what &apos;d i ever do to this guy ?
they released these fucks from the can . obviously , he wasn &apos;t rehabilitated .
it &apos;s my livelihood .
i don &apos;t have a yard no more , sally , i &apos;m in a condo .
otherwise , you know , i &apos;d have ya out there with your snippers ,
even with your bum wing .
my wife , at this point ...
she &apos;s got me thinking about going to the cops .
what are you talking about ? where are you from ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
you got friends , don &apos;t ya ?
i always steered clear of stuff .
what stuff ? i go , i talk to the guy for ya . get you back your stops .
i know him .
yeah ?
so you give me a token ,
i don &apos;t know , couple percent .
thanks , paulie .
this one and the next one .
there he is , the king of breadsticks .
i &apos;ll give you a breadstick up your ass . come here , you .
come on , sit down .
so , how &apos;s the kid , huh , tony ?
he &apos;s good , you know .
but ask me , he should &apos;ve stood with carmela .
some men need wives , huh ? tell you when to shit and when to scratch your ass .
who needs them , huh ?
what can i do for you , paul ?
i got a guy , i think you may have run into him ,
gardener name of sal vitro . does my aunt &apos;s grass .
he says your nephew &apos;s moving into his neighborhood
franklin parkway .
his neighborhood ?
he &apos;s been working there since back when i lived there .
anyway , i &apos;m here putting in a word for the kid .
so do me a favor , huh ? you and your nephew over there , lay off .
hey , biscotti ? no .
you know mr. jerry , the fruit who owns those hair salons , huh ?
he came to me the other day ,
he asked me to take his action on the knicks .
jerry &apos;s my fucking customer , for years now .
which is why i told him no .
this gardener , he cut the hair on your balls , too ?
he &apos;s a friend of my aunt mary &apos;s . which is why he don &apos;t belong to nobody .
what do you know about who belongs to what ?
you been away 20 years !
which entitles me to earn !
which entitles you to shit .
in my book , you get points for staying outta the can .
good thing for me , then , that your book don &apos;t mean oogatz to me !
what &apos;s yours is yours , paulie , but what ain &apos;t is anybody else &apos;s !
now do yourself a fucking favor and get the fuck outta my store !
so are we picking bobby up , or is he gonna meet us at uncle jun &apos;s ?
he took the kids to the 12 : 00 mass .
i didn &apos;t know he was religious .
at this point he &apos;ll try anything , i guess .
bobby jr. started wetting his bed again . practically every night .
bobby came by to see me the other day .
really ?
so we discuss his career , i &apos;m his wife .
sometimes he needs a push .
junior &apos;s your uncle too , in case you
wanna play more of an active role ...
i try , believe me .
despite all the work i have with my own family .
you know , i cook for bobby and the kids every night .
i did sunday dinner at my house ,
and now i gotta prepare the starters and schlep &apos; em to uncle jun &apos;s .
yeah , barb &apos;s helping out all the way down from brewster .
barbara &apos;s kids are normal .
this family stuff , these sunday dinners , they &apos;re important ,
janice .
hey , jan. julio ? help me get this order ?
okay .
you know , every day i understand more and more what ma went through .
i mean we bitch about her , but i tell you ,
it is less and less a mystery why she was the way she was .
she chose to be that way
you don &apos;t choose that , tony .
an ungrateful husband , selfish kids .
how &apos;s that food that janice prepared ?
two more minutes . artie &apos;s re @-@ sauting the mushrooms .
could i get you a glass of wine , something to drink ?
no , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll have a pinot grigio .
20 minutes , start the shells .
just redoing the mushrooms , two minutes tops .
well relax , i just ... came in to say hello .
so how you doing ?
hanging in .
heard you were over there at the motel 6 .
my aunt took the house back .
i &apos;m moving in with my cousin at the end of the month .
look , if you want ,
i &apos;m staying over at my mother &apos;s and the place is empty .
you can bunk with me for a while .
no . thank you .
i was talking with my cousin , tony b ,
and he said it &apos;s fucking stupid that we &apos;re on the outs .
i &apos;m telling ya , the place is just sitting there , two extra bedrooms
i don &apos;t know .
why not ? artie , we &apos;re like brothers .
how long are we gonna hold a grudge ?
thanks , tony . thank you very much .
yeah , all right .
all right .
listen , i gotta talk to you about your linens ...
the napkins and tablecloths , all that shit .
i got something going . i think i can save you like 70 % .
there &apos;s been a lot of progress to the facade . in some instances ,
all of the paint comes off .
now tell me , what product is used ...
i don &apos;t get these old antique houses . they &apos;re grimy looking .
we gonna eat today or what ?
barbara and tom aren &apos;t here yet with the entrees , uncle jun &apos; .
when were they supposed to come ?
2 : 00 , i told you five minutes ago .
here . why don &apos;t we start on the macaroni ?
everybody come on !
bolognese has meat , obviously , the marinara doesn &apos;t .
and barb will be here with the chicken parm and the veal pizzaiola .
so anthony , how &apos;d you guys do against delbarton last season ?
not so good , we lost both times .
it &apos;s that line coach .
&quot; star @-@ ledger &quot; says
delbartonys gonna be even tougher this coming year
with that chinese kid .
your father never had the makings of a varsity athlete .
oh , what the ... ?
what the hell &apos;s with you ?
what ? it &apos;s not true .
i lettered in football .
you never played college ball .
college ?
those guys from seton hall were seven feet tall some of them .
took an academic leave anyway .
small hands , that was your problem .
oh yeah , daddy always said that .
that &apos;s not the point .
what is it with you and this obsession with this varsity crap ?
the other day you said it .
when i was a kid you told the girl cousins the same thing ,
it was hurtful . -tony , relax , it &apos;s not a big deal .
it &apos;s undermining !
and it &apos;s the kinda stuff i &apos;m teaching my kids not to do .
so i don &apos;t wanna hear it again ! end of subject !
honey , pass me the ricotta , please .
in here !
hello ? hey !
hi , sorry we &apos;re late .
the tappan zee was a nightmare .
checking the trucks again .
well , sit down and dig into this medley of pastas that janice whipped up .
how you doing , uncle jun ?
i don &apos;t like tardiness .
let me unwrap these .
this looks great .
thank you .
so coming down i heard on the radio ,
looks like the jets are gonna grab that kid from tulsa , that tight end .
we still get those season tickets , big brother ?
he never had the makings of a varsity athlete .
son of a bitch !
what ?
did i just tell you not to say that ?
say what ?
you don &apos;t like the way i talk ,
get outta my house !
here we go .
tony ...
no &quot; tony &quot; shit !
get your coat , we &apos;re leaving .
i don &apos;t have a coat .
well then get moving , god damn it !
will someone please tell me what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s my last sunday dinner here , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
uncle jun , was that really necessary ?
he &apos;s a goddamn hothouse flower , that &apos;s his problem .
thank you for getting my tv fixed , paulie .
it &apos;s such a sin . he fired his spanish helper .
took his boy outta college &apos; cause he couldn &apos;t afford it anymore .
he said it &apos;s his last time coming here .
you speak to the man ?
i &apos;ll see you later .
so what &apos;s up ?
nothing , i thought we &apos;d be first in line for opening day .
peanuts are on me .
angelo garepe came to see me .
mm @-@ hmm . lorraine calluzzo reached out .
fucking twat .
didn &apos;t you fuck her once ?
yeah , a million years ago . what , is nothing a secret ?
obviously you wanna maintain stability ,
but having phil leotardo smack your shies around , is that the smartest thing ?
i gotta nip this little carmine shit in the bud .
otherwise i could see a lot of people start fucking around .
power vacuum , the capos bide their time ,
nobody &apos;s sure who to pay , so nobody gets paid .
all right , i hear you .
no one likes that cunt anyway .
any problem , she &apos;s &quot; whack this one , whack that one . &quot;
never enough body count for lorraine .
fuck her , let her taste her own medicine !
all right , whatever .
i &apos;ll tell you something else . in large measure ,
i blame you for this shit with little carmine .
what the fuck did i do ?
you legitimized him . man of your stature goes to florida
to see that schmuck ?
all right . come on , huh ?
we both agree that little carmine &apos;s a fucking asshole ,
but the fact is he &apos;s got
a following loyal to his old man .
so ?
so , angelo had an idea .
what if ... and he &apos;s just floating this to keep the peace ...
what if there was a power @-@ sharing situation ?
power sharing .
you &apos;re all in charge equally ,
but no major decisions can be made without a majority of two .
what the fuck ?
hey , this way
you &apos;re not such a big target for the feds .
three of the other families have this kind of arrangement .
what &apos;s this , the fucking u.n. now ? !
all right forget it ! forget i said it !
fuck that !
everyone deserves to choose how they feel ,
to experience the love , the joy , the happiness , the passion .
where &apos;s junior ?
upstairs taking a nap .
the garage is open , his car is gone .
where is he ?
i &apos;m telling you , i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t think somebody put the snatch on him , do you ?
when did you see him last ?
an hour ago . two .
i fell asleep .
maybe he drove to the store .
his wallet &apos;s here , his watch .
with his bail , he &apos;s not allowed to leave the house anyway .
junior .
so when they say they &apos;re not interested ,
you say , &quot; you &apos;re not interested in keeping kids off drugs ? &quot;
what , shabazz ?
nobody wants them turkish taffies .
you push harder .
what did i tell you about profit margin ?
where &apos;s johnny ?
we closed now .
let me talk to damiano .
we rented the hall today .
i &apos;m looking for johnny soprano , god damn it .
hey , this here &apos;s a church .
you can &apos;t talk like that in here
get out , go on . we &apos;re working here .
i wanna see johnny soprano .
ain &apos;t no johnny here .
i &apos;m his brother . he owns this place .
hold up , now .
back in the day , this was an italian neighborhood .
some fellas had this place here .
kept those vending machines .
well , there ain &apos;t no vending machines here no more .
come on , fool , go on .
all right , roberta , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
bobbi sanfillipo ?
junior hasn &apos;t kept time with her in years .
yeah , i realize that .
you know , now that i think about it ,
junior was acting a little peculiar when i got here today .
said he wanted to see johnny .
what johnny ?
his brother ?
i don &apos;t know .
also there the other day , we were watching the tv ,
he thought he saw himself on one of the programs .
we have got the dishwashing liquid ...
concentrated dishwashing liquid .
concentrated dishwashing liquid .
it &apos;s me .
did you drop off the drycleaning ?
your uncle &apos;s missing .
he took his car . he didn &apos;t call you , did he ?
no .
where the hell is he ?
he &apos;s like an old woman . he &apos;s probably gossiping with a neighbor .
did you check the ramirez &apos;s next door ?
i &apos;m afraid he might &apos;ve wandered . my grandfather did this .
maybe you better call tony .
i can &apos;t just dump this on tony .
i gotta find him .
i need you to come here in case he comes back .
bobby , i just can &apos;t ... -i need your help here ! jesus christ !
sometimes i think i love junior more than you do !
we may know that there are five essentials for victory :
one , he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight ;
two , he will win who knows how to ...
you gary ?
i &apos;m jimmy . gary &apos;s up there .
hey , come down here !
what ?
i said get down here !
i wanna talk to you !
what do you want ?
i &apos;m a friend of sal vitro &apos;s .
my aunt lives on this street .
so
so i &apos;m guessing sal vitro used to do this yard .
a lotta things used to be
maybe so ,
but you &apos;re gonna make good on his busted arm .
oh yeah ? why am i gonna do that ?
&apos;cause i said so , that &apos;s why .
eat shit , pal .
why don &apos;t you take a walk , huh ?
give me your wallet , you prick .
this and the mower &apos;s a down payment .
by next tuesday i want sal vitro &apos;s whole orthopedist bill paid .
let &apos;s call it $ 1,200 .
on top of that , from now on i get 10 % of whatever you make in this neighborhood .
you motherfucker !
shut up or i &apos;ll give you a crack
time is it ?
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll take the tunnel .
all right , this meeting today , we &apos;re trying to nail down a new contractor
now with massarone gone .
that office park by troy hills ?
listen ... and this is very important ...
if any of this shit with little carmine and johnny comes up , you clam up .
you got it , tony .
say nothing . &apos; cause you say the wrong thing ...
what ?
tony , it &apos;s me .
listen , it &apos;s your uncle . he &apos;s gone .
you mean he &apos;s dead ?
no , no , no , no . we think he might &apos;ve wandered off .
you know , i didn &apos;t wanna call you but it &apos;s been a couple hours now .
fuck him
he said he was going to see johnny .
you think he might &apos;ve meant your dad ?
what ?
he &apos;s wandering , tony .
he can wander off the palisades for all i care . he &apos;s fucking dead to me .
i called you almost an hour ago . where the hell have you been ?
hello ? i was picking up your daughter .
stay here , i &apos;m going out .
where the hell is tommy ?
i sent him home .
oh , wonderful . he gets the day off , and i get to wait by the phone .
it &apos;s because of him junior escaped .
dad , can i go with you ?
no .
can janice go and we can stay here ?
what &apos;d i tell you about being impolite ?
if anyone cares , i &apos;ll be upstairs lying down .
one hour of television , then you both finish your homework .
and you , lay off the snapple .
what galls me is that before
little carmine went to florida , i was actually close with him .
i was in his wedding party .
organized his whole fucking bachelor party ...
lesbian show , whores ... fucking disgusting .
then when they had that kid with the lung problem ,
who you think got him that doctor on park avenue ?
water over the dam , huh ?
i had no idea you guys were that close .
close ? we were like brothers .
it &apos;s a shame that you can &apos;t find a way to work things out .
give me piece of bread , huh ?
have you thought about this ?
maybe you let him keep lorraine ,
and you take a bigger piece of his florida shit , the clubs .
if i wanted to worry about florida , i would move to fucking miami .
you know , it wasn &apos;t long ago i remember you used to wait in the car .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned you should still be there !
he was just trying ...
fuck &quot; he was just ! &quot;
everybody &apos;s got a goddamn opinion !
i didn &apos;t say nothing , tony .
what the fuck did i say ? !
i &apos;m sorry , tony , i just ...
now i gotta un @-@ fuck what you just fucked up .
gotta do something nice for johnny . like what ?
what the fuck am i supposed to do ? !
you gotta understand , this shit between johnny and little carmine is bad .
the instability . but worse comes to worst , it could work to our advantage .
how ?
they fight , we pick up any crumbs from the fallout .
the odds are that johnny &apos;ll end up on top , but who knows ?
so keep your ears open and your mouth shut !
apparently , there &apos;s a new president at the electrician &apos;s union .
tony sent chrissy over there to talk to him .
something i &apos;ve always been meaning to get straight ...
tony calls christopher his nephew ,
yet sometimes you refer to them as cousins .
yeah , right . see , chrissy &apos;s not tony &apos;s nephew .
chrissy &apos;s carmela &apos;s cousin .
she was first cousin to dickie moltisanti , chrissy &apos;s dad .
but he was always kinda like a big brother to tony , dickie .
so tony calls chrissy his nephew .
it &apos;s an italian thing .
okay .
although technically , tony and chrissy are cousins .
joanne blundetto , chrissy &apos;s mom ,
is tony &apos;s cousin on his mother &apos;s side ?
but , like way back .
like from the old country or something .
robyn ?
what ?
how much longer am i gonna have to keep doing this ?
major rico against tony soprano ?
those things take years to build .
this recent case against joe massino in new york ?
it was seven years before indictments were handed down .
hello , handsome .
where you living now ? around here ?
do you know me ?
do i know you ?
jupiter club on 6th street ?
caught fire , that place .
lot of people died .
do you know my brother , johnny ?
you got all the looks , i &apos;ll tell ya that .
what are you saying ?
you and i had relations ?
son of a bitch in a taxicab , run me right over my foot .
i have a car .
want a date ?
i &apos;ll give you half and half in the back seat .
i want to go home .
let me get a ride by the shelter .
i have to find my car .

oh yeah , yeah , she mentioned it .
catch you in there , t.
yeah .
i think with the right meds we can control these things .
what things ?
the infarcts .
they &apos;re akin to mini @-@ strokes .
he suffered significant brain trauma the other day .
you probably noticed him acting differently over the past six months , a year maybe .
well to tell you the truth ,
me and my uncle , we don &apos;t talk much anymore .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
don &apos;t be , he &apos;s a hostile prick .
well , unfortunately obstinacy is consistent with his condition .
impatience , forgetfulness , particularly with short @-@ term memory .
do you find he &apos;ll ask the same question every three minutes ? what time it is ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
it &apos;s frustrating , i know .
anyway , the last thing i wanted to do was get in the middle of a family squabble
i just wanted to say hello .
well , nice seeing you .
okay . all right .
member of the squirrel family ,
the prairie dog makes its home mainly ...
tommy ?
brought you some fish .
trying to clean out my refrigerator .
make sure you form a seal when you shut that freezer door .
of the two main species ,
the black @-@ tailed prairie dog is much more widespread ,
inhabiting much of the great plains and the great basin .
so how you feeling ?
heard you had a little problem .
what problem ?
all right .
but your doctor said something different .
who , kennedy ?
kennedy &apos;s your cancer doctor .
i knew that .
you said doctor .
the white @-@ tailed prairie dog lives at higher elevations ,
hibernating throughout the winter .
just take your medicine , uncle jun.
make you feel better .
help with your memory .
believe me , there &apos;s plenty i &apos;d like to forget .
yeah , you and me both .
feech was here ?
yeah , he came to pay his respects .
what &apos;s this i hear ,
you ruled against feech ?
he &apos;s an important man .
why is he bitching at you about shit ?
i &apos;m still the boss of this family , despite any arrangements .
yellow in color , they often have dark ...
these prairie dogs , they &apos;ll sleep during the day .
oh yeah ?
look , the doctor said you might not have known what you were saying .
what are you talking about ?
the varsity shit .
so , what else did feech have to say ?
getting a new top on his convertible .
all right , let &apos;s assume that you didn &apos;t know what you were saying .
that you forget you say shit over and over .
yeah ?
why &apos;s it gotta be something mean ?
why can &apos;t you repeat something good ?
there &apos;s the coyote .
