i had to get up so early for my bus ,
i caught the tail end of what cinemax gets up to at night .
subscription canceled .
i got that channel for eddie murphy movies ,
not stimulation .
wait , why are you taking the bus ?
what happened to your minivan ?
my ex @-@ husband needed it .
the person he &apos;s dating works at a club .
an hour from the city .
ah , well , i &apos;ll play a violin for them ,
and maybe she can strip to it .
kind people are always kind , britta ,
not just when it &apos;s easy .
as we stand once again upon the deadline
to drop or add classes ,
i hereby present this semester &apos;s jeff winger pick
for ultimate blow @-@ off class :
beginner pottery .
i don &apos;t know-- your last &quot; blow @-@ off &quot; class
ended up teaching me to live in the moment ,
which i will always regret and never do again .
this one &apos;s different . i researched .
you don &apos;t even have to make a good pot .
you get an art credit for participation .
this class is like a redhead that drinks scotch
and loves &quot; die hard . &quot;
i suggest you all get her number .
guess which class i signed up for .
singing with tennille ?
sailing .
but the nearest body of water is 2.1 / 2 hours away .
leagues , abed .
we don &apos;t measure water by hours .
it &apos;s a one @-@ week intensive
that gives you hands @-@ on experience on a real boat
right here in the parking lot .
i &apos;d rather learn boats than pots .
i was going to take a class on how to put together
an online dating profile ,
but i think sailing in the parking lot
is less pathetic .
a black person on a sailboat ?
i gotta see this . i &apos;m in .
how &apos; bout you , abed ? wanna sail with us ?
there &apos;s black people .
mm @-@ hmm , there &apos;s two .
all right .
hello , ladies . what are you guys making ,
big balls here ?
oh , yeah . you guys getting dirty ?
what are you looking at ?
heh , all right .
hey , laura ingalls .
home depot guy .
who &apos;s making pots ?
let &apos;s participate this thing .
ladies , i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re laughing .
i really do want to make my mom an ashtray .
hello , my precious blueberries .
hello .
all right , let &apos;s spin those wheels and play .
with some clay .
now there &apos;s one , and only one , rule in this class .
i will tolerate no reenacting ,
whether it &apos;s ironic or sincere ,
of the patrick swayze , demi moore
pottery scene in &quot; ghost . &quot;
ever since that movie was released in 1990,
i have seen every conceivable variation
of what i call &quot; ghosting . &quot;
this could be guy @-@ on @-@ girl , girl @-@ on @-@ guy ...
the hilarious guy @-@ on @-@ guy .
so , since it never stopped ,
i had to adopt a zero ghost tolerance policy .
if you so much as hum three notes
from that righteous brothers song ,
with god is my witness , i will come at you .
with everything i &apos;ve got .
okay ?
let &apos;s have a great time !
i &apos;m making falafel .
not edible .
what are you making ?
a vase .
hey , guys .
yep ?
look what i made .
participant badge .
oh , god .
i don &apos;t know how .
i mean , i just--
i stuck my hands into the clay
and it happened .
you look at me .
you have a gift .
jeff &apos;s competitive side had come out before .
he had even displayed envy .
but on that first day of pottery class , he discovered--
abed .
yeah .
what did we discuss ?
no voiceover . sorry .
it is kind of a crutch .
第一季 第十九集
校对 : 爱米粒 独醉
i &apos;ve never been on a boat before .
i didn &apos;t know what to wear .
yeah , it &apos;s intimidating .
we &apos;re in pierce &apos;s world now .
he &apos;s got all the boat clothes .
look at him christen .
that were me , i would have broken the bottle .
i &apos;m professor slaughter .
welcome aboard the s.s. nose candy ,
recently purchased through government auction .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s not nice-- it &apos;s your only weapon
against the raging sea .
you don &apos;t know how to use her , you &apos;re dead .
together , you will work as one crew .
you will succeed or fail as one crew .
you will consider this parking lot the ocean .
whatever you drop , you lose .
mishandle the sails-- you capsize and die .
now , does little miss nice have a name ?
sh @-@ shirley bennett .
well , now you &apos;re captain shirley bennett .
aw , man !
you will follow her every order .
i &apos;ve never been a captain before .
i have .
i commanded a jet ski through an electrical storm
and only had one casualty .
jet skis only hold two people .
exactly . saved half the crew .
pottery &apos;s much cooler than i thought .
and harder !
well , except for that guy rich .
he &apos;s , like , a natural .
yeah , i &apos;m worried about the effect
that it &apos;s having on jeff , though .
someone call a shrink . what ?
well , you &apos;re usually the cool one .
abed ... you understand the point
of a blow @-@ off class is to blow it off ,
not to be cool , making really important mud pies .
you &apos;re not willing to admit he &apos;s talented ?
no , because he &apos;s not .
i mean , if i were ever to make an effort in that class ,
you &apos;d think i was the cat &apos;s pajamas too .
cat &apos;s pajamas ? okay , pierce .
wow , somebody &apos;s mommy gave him too much praise .
man , so did someone &apos;s psyche teacher .
senor chang .
yes , i was robbed at the ymca ... again .
all right .
let &apos;s do this .
jeff , do you know what you are ?
you &apos;re special .
you &apos;re very special , jeff .
you &apos;re the most special little boy in the world .
take her back to harbor !
flank the sheets and , uh , trim the head sail .
aye @-@ aye .
aye @-@ aye .
eyes on me for a moment .
i don &apos;t see students here .
i see seamen .
and i didn &apos;t create them .
from the moment you climbed aboard ,
i saw seamen inside you .
more importantly ,
you &apos;ve stopped giggling at the word &quot; seamen , &quot;
and that &apos;s the mark of a real seaman .
all right , as you were .
okay , then .
crew , make fast the topping lift .
i &apos;ll get the rope .
oh , my god !
damn , he &apos;s ghost riding the jib .
pierce , hang on !
that hat &apos;s gone . lost at sea .
i might be able to reach it !
it landed on that hyundai .
i mean , mermaid &apos;s car .
get back on this boat !
no , no , no .
well , i spoke too soon .
everybody gets a &quot; d. &quot;
if i &apos;d have chosen to hit you with a storm just then ,
you all would have failed .
you better get your crew in line , captain .
permission to speak ?
you really screwed the pooch on that one , captain .
and i can &apos;t swim .
so you see , ladies ,
it &apos;s actually a working fountain ...
with a bird .
hey , jeff , ready to make some art
in the shape of a vase ?
no , i can &apos;t .
let me take a look .
uh , come on , rich .
being good at beginner pottery
doesn &apos;t mean you can heal people .
that &apos;s true .
but my medical degree does . i &apos;m a doctor .
a doctor ?
i just take pottery to unwind .
haven &apos;t lost a patient in five years
puts a lot of pressure on a person .
so the good news is this is neither sprained nor broken .
oh , thank god .
but i &apos;ll have to get a second opinion from a guy
in my basket weaving class .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s funny .
good to see you getting along with rich .
what &apos;s he like ?
he &apos;s a ringer .
a what ?
you know , a conman , a grifter .
a ringer .
he &apos;s an expert potter who signs up for novice classes
to impress people .
but if he wants to impress people ,
why join a pottery class ?
why not just say , &quot; hi , i &apos;m a doctor . &quot;
because he &apos;s crazy .
and fancy jobs don &apos;t impress people .
i mean , you weren &apos;t impressed i &apos;m a lawyer .
well , anyone could be a lawyer .
you can even represent yourself .
you can &apos;t do surgery on yourself .
it &apos;s illegal . you &apos;d get arrested .
and then you &apos;d get a free lawyer .
rich just showed me how to make a flared lip on my pot
and check for breast lumps .
i don &apos;t know how
and i don &apos;t know when ,
but one day , that guy is gonna slip up .
and when that happens ,
i am gonna be there to expose him .
jeff , check it out .
if your finger &apos;s still bugging you ,
just get creative .
i wanna kiss you on the mouth .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , rich . hey !
don &apos;t run so fast .
you &apos;re among friends .
how you doing , jeff ? what &apos;s up ?
oh , not much . nada mucho .
noddily ... merchant .
i just wanted to thank you , doc pottery @-@ wood ,
for taking a look at my finger .
anytime .
doc pottery @-@ wood . i like it .
yeah . have you taken many pottery classes ?
no , this is my first .
of the year ?
ever .
no pottery at doctor &apos;s school ?
medical school ?
pottery school .
pottery school ?
oh , pottery school , how long ?
you know , jeff , it &apos;s kind of weird .
i feel like i &apos;m being interrogated ,
but by someone who doesn &apos;t really want to know
anything important .
oh , hey ... new mexico .
long way from home .
yeah , well , i did my residency in santa fe .
santa fe ?
yeah . can i give you a lift somewhere ?
oh ... no , thanks .
i &apos;m gettin &apos; there .
well , of course , yes , he &apos;d be in college .
did you sleep here ?
only for a few hours .
guess where rich is from .
couldn &apos;t have been &quot; crazy town . &quot;
you &apos;d have gone to high school together .
santa fe , new mexico .
nobody gets out of santa fe without learning how to make a pot .
45 % hispanic ,
fifth highest native american population .
they eat and breathe clay there .
i think some of this research may have been done on wikipedia .
you &apos;re mocking me ?
you ? no , no .
fine , fine , fine . go ahead--mock me .
oh , jeff ... you &apos;re goldbluming .
i &apos;m goldbluming ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know what that means .
look , i have work to do , before class ,
because i want to catch rich when he slips up .
who even cares if he &apos;s pretending to be a beginner ?
pottery cares .
integrity cares .
look , i don &apos;t care .
i just care that he cares .
it &apos;s lame that he cares .
yeah , yeah , yeah . my shoelace came untied .
it could happen to anybody .
that &apos;s your excuse ?
britta weighs five pounds , troy can &apos;t swim ,
and i &apos;ve never even seen the ocean .
uh , i can swim , racist .
you listen to me , pierce .
on my boat , the crew comes first .
no single person is above it .
you either shape up or ship the hell out .
now i know what the &quot; c &quot; in &quot; captain &quot; stands for .
crabapple .
shirley , i thought you said
that kind people were always kind .
yes , and strong people change .
if the sea was always still and calm ,
nobody would respect her .
i &apos;m like the sea .
cuckoo birds , do you mind ?
this is important .
college is where most mental health problems are activated .
i hope i get multiple personalities .
i get lonely in long showers .
barometer &apos;s dropping . temperature &apos;s warm .
we &apos;re heading into a high pressure flow .
that &apos;s a perfect storm .
reef the mainsail and furl the jib !
is that nautical talk or urban speak ?
we have to turn back .
accidental jib !
hit the deck !
man overboard !
oh , my god , pierce is dead !
no , wait . his stomach is moving .
oh , my god . pierce ! gah !
ohh ! that &apos;s it .
pull me in !
the storm is overtaking you , captain .
we don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m trying as hard as i can .
i have skinny arms for a quarterback .
i said we don &apos;t have time .
what ? no . wha--wait .
pull me in . what do you mean &quot; time &quot; ?
i--that &apos;s it .
wha-- no ! nooo !
bring the boom amidship .
nooo !
what in god &apos;s name have we done ?
get out of my parking spot , dip @-@ wad !
security !
i mean , take an intermediate class if you &apos;re intermediate .
don &apos;t come in here making your fear of failure our problem .
i mean , it &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s crazy .
i mean , he &apos;s a crazy person .
i &apos;m scared .
it &apos;s okay . this is good for him .
he &apos;s confronting his own limitations .
busted !
fatal mistake , richy boy .
you ... are ... busted .
i am ?
you just used the throwing off the hump method .
that &apos;s an advanced pottery technique ,
which i know , because last night ,
i read the entire encyclopedia of pottery .
what are you talking about ?
you are no beginner ...
santa fe .
hey , what is going on , my blueberries ?
show him what you did .
no .
i rest my case .
what case ?
throw the freakin &apos; hump , imposter !
no ! what are you ...
it &apos;s the hilarious guy @-@ on @-@ guy .
one rule i asked you to follow . one .
look ! -
i had it made before he died .
it &apos;s not in bad taste .
out , winger !
fine .
that &apos;s fine . no , that &apos;s fine .
congratulations .
you failed a class so easy
that people pass it in the hallway
get a contact credit !
* oh *
* my love *
* my darlin &apos; *
you son of a--
* i &apos;ve hungered for your touch *
no ! nooo !
this is abuse !
this is abuse ! stop it ! that is a satanic sound !
* are you still mine ? *
pierce , do you still have the number of that private investigator
you used when you thought ross perot was sleeping with your mom ?
is this about that guy in your pottery class ?
yeah .
face the facts , jeffrey .
this kid &apos;s got some natural talent you just don &apos;t have .
how would you know ?
it &apos;s all over the school .
great .
why aren &apos;t you in sailing class ?
uh , they drowned me .
why ?
for a better grade .
look , weren &apos;t we discussing your flaws , jeff ?
i mean , why are you letting this guy get to you so much ?
what &apos;s really going on ?
i made a bad pot .
for some reason , i always thought that i was special
and different .
and i guess i just have a really hard time
when i want to be good at something ,
and i suck .
uh @-@ huh .
here , give me a hand .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going back to my sailing class .
after they murdered you ?
jeffrey , when i was born ,
i got my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck ,
both arms , and one of my ankles .
mom said that there came a point
when the doctors stopped delivering me
and just started laughing .
i mean , if i ever let being bad at something stop me ,
i wouldn &apos;t even be here .
that thing some men call failure ,
i call living .
breakfast .
and i &apos;m not leaving till i &apos;ve cleaned out the buffet .
now , how &apos; bout a shove ?
good luck , pierce .
don &apos;t need it . never had it .
britta , trim the boom flat .
troy , sit windward to heal the boat .
my , the sea has a worthy opponent .
oh , my god . it &apos;s pierce .
man , that guy &apos;s life is one , big joke .
i mean , i feel bad for him ,
but things have been running smoother
since he drowned .
i bet he gets that all the time .
son of a ... uhh .
oh , my god .
hey ! i &apos;m going down !
pierce is going to be the only person ever
to drown in a parking lot .
twice .
help !
damn the storm !
we &apos;re going after pierce .
jump the halyard .
star @-@ burns , you get down there
and you man the iron jenny .
there &apos;s a man overboard !
that &apos;s an order !
i &apos;m gonna sink !
i am about to get the only &quot; a &quot; i will ever get ,
and pierce isn &apos;t even dying .
bailing !
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i know .
but i &apos;d rather be kind
and get stepped on every once in a while
than be a hard @-@ ass and turn my back on a friend .
hoist the mains .
s.o.s. !
beep beep ! help !
i don &apos;t wanna go this way .
we &apos;re coming , pierce !
help !
how &apos;s it looking ?
we gotta go faster !
okay , come on , star @-@ burns !
it &apos;s filling with water !
it &apos;s going down !
pierce , we &apos;re coming !
dear god . dear god .
oh , yeah . oh , britta .
troy . ohh .
here you go .
we got you . here you go .
okay .
you okay ?
you all right ?
you just steered your boat into a storm .
any last words ?
the sea may be cold and unforgiving ,
but i &apos;m not .
the ship might go down , but , uh ...
at least she &apos;ll go down with honor .
i &apos;ll take your captain &apos;s hat .
&apos;cause i &apos;m promoting you to admiral .
you all get an &quot; a. &quot;
admiral shirley . i like that .
well , it means nothing , really .
the class is over .
but you deserve it .
hey , somebody has to to this .
i &apos;m king of the wo--
don &apos;t ruin a perfect week .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna spoon you again .
i appreciate that .
yeah , i can &apos;t ...
fully explain my behavior .
i mean , i &apos;d love to blame boozer
or demon possession , but--
you know what ?
don &apos;t even worry about it .
i &apos;m bad at holding grudges .
well , i &apos;m bad at pottery .
i &apos;m an amateur pottery enthusiast
trying as hard as i can
at something i suck at .
it &apos;s great .
and the teacher said i can stay ,
if i don &apos;t have any more &quot; ghost &quot; bursts .
fantastic .
well , good luck .
don &apos;t need it .
jeff , you &apos;re a normal person .
there &apos;s nothing very special about you at all .
you &apos;re going to be great at a few things ,
but really crappy at many more .
and that takes a lot of the pressure off ,
so you can live a full , happy life .
oh , and sorry it took me so long to tell you that .
and it was only in your imagination .
my bad .
kind of a sloppy mom .
that &apos;s okay , mom .
nobody &apos;s perfect .
i &apos;m still scared .
a clay ashtray .
you &apos;re an idiot .
why do you have time to make pottery ?
couldn &apos;t you use a little more practice being a doctor ?
not that it &apos;ll ever bring your brother back to life .
it was supposed to be you on that roller coaster , richard .
it was supposed to be you !
