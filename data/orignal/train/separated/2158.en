Five-O! Hands up.
Hands, hands!
Hands up.
On your knees.
Down on your knees now.
Put your hands behind your head.
Put your hands behind your head.
Hey, look at me, look at me.
Where's Chin Ho Kelly?
Huh? Where is he?
Did you see that, officer?
That's assault.
I'd like to press charges.
Yeah?
What is this?
Who are you?
She was so beautiful.
What do you want?
Guy like you has nine lives.
You lost your badge.
You got it back.
Then you break the law
multiple times and you get away with it.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Man, it feels like I haven't seen you in ages.
Just five days.
Not that I've been counting.
You know, I'm sorry.It's just, uh,
you know, getting Michael up to speed on
the business is taking longer than expected.
What?
You... you just keep apologizing
for something that I don't have a problem with.
I think it's great that Michael's back in your life.
Don't you?
Yeah, of course.
But it's... it's complicated.
Before Michael went to prison,
I was away at law school, and...
you know, he was going to run our father's business.
Now that we're taking things in a new direction.
Michael's a little out of his comfort zone.
I think he's really lucky
to have you as his big brother.
It's the best influence he could have right now.
Ah, come on.
That is the third call in a row.
Yeah, I should probably get that.
Listen.
Really? Hmm?
Don't go anywhere.
You better hurry.
Hey, I told you not to call me at this number.
I won't do such a thing.
We didn't agree to this.
Where are you?
I'll meet you in 20.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just...
business.
Listen, uh...
I'm sorry.
What?
Rain check?
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Okay? I'll make it up to you.
I promise, okay?

Trust me, brothers, this is gonna take your taste buds
to a whole new level.
All right.
I think this is the next big thing.
A burrito. You know,
I'm pretty sure that's already a big thing.
Not like this one-- I'm calling it
Kamekona's Sunrise Fusion Shrimp Breakfast Burrito.
It's got eggs, it's got cheddar...
pineapple salsa, shrimp,
and a very secret special ingredient.
Spam.
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no,no, no.
How did I sign up for this?
What happened?
Why do you got to be such a baby?
Try something new. Expand your horizons.
My horizons are expanded plenty.
I just do not do the Hawaiian mystery meat,
you know this.
Yeah, first of all,
it doesn't come from Hawaii.
Oh, no?
No. That's right, it doesn't.
G.I.'s brought it over in World War II
because it was cheap, portable
and did not require refrigeration.
And it goes down smooth, thanks to the glaze.
What you think?
That's interesting.
Okay, I will have a nice,
uh, old-fashioned
breakfast burrito with eggs and bacon.
Oh, no, no, no. No substitutions, no changes.
A true chef never, never compromises his culinary vision.
Hey, guys.
Wow! Look at that.
Bringing back the '80s with the rollerblades.
You got those Duran Duran cassette tapes
you can lend her?
Got 'em.
Yeah, you know, good for a workout, keeping in shape.
But I am "Hungry Like a Wolf."
That was good. That was funny.
Um, you missed the tasting, luckily.
Oh, that bad?
Oh, I don't know. Spam wrapped in a suck.
Glad I'm late.
Hey, where's Chin?
Oh, he texted me late last night.
He, uh, said he was gonna take a few days off,
go up to North Shore.
Since when does Chin go on vacation?
I don't know.
He's, uh... he's not on vacation.
I can't believe I didn't remember this.
What? Remember what?
He and Malia's first date was eight years ago
up on the North Shore.
And today's the anniversary.
All right. Look, if Chin wants some space,
we'll give him some space.
Yep.
Attention on the cell block, watch the gates.
Gates are opening.
Time for chow! Line up and shut up!
Step out, inmates. It's chow time.
Let's go. Hands by your side.
Everybody step out.
Look who's in lockup.
Same cop who threw me in here.
Inmate, slow down! On the ground now!
I need your help.
My name is Chin Ho Kelly.
I'm with Five-O.
I said on the ground.
I'm trying to tell you, I'm a cop. Something's wrong.
Somebody put me in here last night.
I am not a prisoner.
Come with me.
Hey, Charlie.
You have any luck tracing that number I called you about?
Can't say I did. I traced it,
but the call came from a burner.
Okay. I was afraid of that.
You didn't have me run that number for a case, did you?
Look...
I came to you because we're friends,
'cause I trust you.
I'm gonna need your help cloning that phone.
It's a mobile data extractor.
It has a built-in SIM card reader
and creates a cloned phone.
Sure you want to do this?
Look, I know you weren't in this cell block last night,
but how the hell did someone sneak you in?
I don't know. Two guys drugged me.
Next thing I know, I wake up in here.
Food service truck makes night deliveries.
That's the only way you could've gotten in here.
Tell me about the two guys. Who are they?
I don't know.
Just get me to Warden Grier,
and I'll prove I'm a cop.
Well, if you are, Halawa's the last place you want to be.
Cops that serve time in here don't do too well.
It's okay. It's a shortcut. It's empty.
Inmates are at first meal. Come on.
What are you doing?! Open the door!
Open the door!
Lieutenant Kelly.
Kaleo.
Warrick told me an old friend was sending me a surprise.
Didn't expect it to be one of the dirty cops who locked me up.
You're the dirty cop.
Good men died because of you.
You belong here.
I don't.
Well, you're here now.
Who put me in here?
Somebody who wants you to suffer before you die.
You must have been a bad boy
to end up in here, Lieutenant.
I didn't... I didn't do anything.
Yeah, that's what we all say.
I heard what you told Kaleo.
Sounds like whoever locked you up is looking to even the score.
Probably somebody you put away.
I've been a cop a long time.
I put a lot of people away.
But I'm betting... Warrick knows who's behind this.
Lieutenant, whoever put you in here doesn't matter.
All that matters is, we got to get you out.
And why should I trust you?
How about 'cause I just saved your sorry ass from Kaleo?
Also, Five-O brought me to this island
and put me up in this classy joint
so I could be closer to my kid.
I owe you.
Oh, and there's, uh, one more thing.
What?
Why the hell did you do that?
The first time we met,
you hit me across the face with an ashtray.
Now that we're even, you can trust me.
We good?
We're good.
Warrick runs Max Security.
His keys only work in A-Block.
Yeah? I got to get word to a guard outside this cell block,
let him know I'm a cop.
Seriously? 'Cause that worked out so well for you last time.
Look, you don't know which guards were paid off--
not a good plan.
We keep moving this way.
All right, what's your plan?
Take the guards out of the equation.
How you gonna do that?
Bring help from the outside in.
Look, what we got to do is find a phone
and get a call out to McGarrett.
There's cons, guards and cameras everywhere.
You won't reach a phone.
Besides, you're running out of time.
They'll be back from chow any minute.
Starting a fire is not going to work.
That's the problem with cops-- too analytical.
You got to think outside the box.
Halawa is not equipped to deal with fires
if they're big enough.
They'll have to call HFD to fight the blaze,
and when the first responders come in,
you tell them you're Five-O.
Look, Lieutenant, you have a better idea, speak up,
but the way I see it, right now,
this is the only choice you got.
So bust a move, huh?
So, what, after I'm gone,
you're just going to go back to sitting in a cell?
Come on, brah. I know you work the angle.
Why you really helping me?
Okay, truth.
Five-O's got the governor's ear.
I figure, I help you,
maybe I'm out in six months instead of six years.
Snitches don't last long in Max. You know that.
I got to get out of here.
Time to send up a smoke signal, huh?
That's smooth, baby.
Hear that?
That's the sound of freedom.
What's going on?
Uh, Steve, this is dr. Harriet Palmer.
She's the HPD grief counselor.
She's here about Chin.
Hi.
Commander McGarrett, I feel terrible coming here.
I have never betrayed my patient's confidence before,
but I'm worried about Chin Ho.
Um, Chin's your patient?
For the past few months.
I had no idea he was seeing a therapist.
He didn't want you to see his grief as a sign of weakness.
What can we do to help?
That's the thing-- she's, uh...
she's concerned 'cause Chin had an appointment today
and he didn't show up.
Well, Chin's on the North Shore.
But he called me last night to confirm his session.
I've been trying to reach him,
but he hasn't answered or returned my calls.
Hey, Chin's not on the North Shore.
I just called the hotel that he usually stays at,
and he never checked in,
so I PING'd his cell,
and it's at his house.
Hey, Chin, buddy, you here?
Chin... Chin.
Hey, he didn't go to the North Shore.
His bike and his car are both still in the garage.
Bed's unmade.
Chin stayed here last night.
Steve... Chin wouldn't leave anywhere
without his cell.
Hey, over here!
All right, back door was open.
Someone jimmied the lock, let themselves in.
I'm thinking Chin was asleep, two intruders come in.
One of them uses that towel to muffle the beeping keypad,
other guy comes over here, disconnects the alarm.
And cuts the phone line
so the alarm company never gets the call.
These guys were pros.
Okay, they also left his keys and his wallet.
This wasn't a robbery.
No, it wasn't a robbery.
They didn't want money; they wanted Chin.
All right, back door was opened at 10:43.
Chin texted me at 12:15.
No, Chin didn't send you anything.
It was the kidnappers who obviously sent that text.
Okay, I'll call CSU,
get 'em down here, process this place,
and I'll see if Fong can lift a print off Chin's cell.
All right.
Okay, who would do this, and why send a text?
I'll tell you why.
They knew, as soon as Chin didn't show up for work,
we would go looking for him, all right?
They're trying to hold us off, buy some time.
Time for what?
Everyone out. Let's go. This is not a drill.
Move it, move it, move it.
Go! Let's go!
Move.
That's HFD.
It's working.
Like I said, sometimes you got to think outside the box.
Where is he?
Come on, let's move it.
Let's go. Come on,
pick it up. let's go.
Hey, no inmates allowed back inside
till we get all clear.
Now, back off.
So much for your smoksignals.
We got to get out of here.
Only door of out here is through them.
Kaleo! Kaleo!
Bring it down!
Hold back HFD.
Lock Max Security down now!
I repeat, lock it down!
Listen up.
This is Kaleo.
We got a cop in here.
Locked a lot of you up.
Name's Chin Ho Kelly.
Find him.
Bring him to me.
Charlie, what did you find?
Whoever used Chin's phone knew enough
to wipe their fingerprints,
so I swabbed the display for trace DNA.
You got something?
Yeah.
It didn't make sense. According to CODIS,
the DNA found on Chin's cell phone
belongs to...
Frank Delano?
It's impossible.
He-he's dead. Chin killed him.
I know.
That's why I amplified the sample
and I'm running it through CODIS again.
My guess is, there's a familial match.
Got a hit.
Paul Delano?
DOB makes him the older brother.
Wait a minute.
Kidnapping Chin has got to be payback for Frank's death.
Charlie, do you mind?
According to the TSA,
Paul arrived on the island three days ago.
And there's no record of him leaving.
Good, good. We'll put him on the no-fly list,
get HPD on the hunt.
All right.
Hey, listen to me.
Chin's a tough guy, all right? He's gonna be okay.
We do our job,
we find Paul Delano, we find Chin.
Come on.
Okay.
There it is.
I told you, those keys
won't get us out of A-Block.
Damn! Damn it!
I know you're out there, Kelly.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and come to me?
I'm gonna find you...
sooner or later.
There's got to be another phone in this cellblock.
There is-- in the security office with Kaleo.
Prisoner holding. There's a public phone.
It's back the way we came.
There's 200 cons between us and that phone.
You have a price on your head.
They want me, not you.
You got a son to think about, remember?
I'll go it alone.
Look, hey, there's no cameras in here.
We can lay low.
Those are bad guys out there. They will kill you.
Bad guys like those
killed my wife.
I'm gonna get out of here,
or die trying.
Catherine, somebody's taken Chin.
Oh, my God.
Can you access Homeland Security's
video surveillance program?
Yeah, whatever you need.
I need you to monitor closed-circuit video feeds
from all over the island.
And who am I looking for?
Paul Delano.
What? As in...?
Yeah.
I'm sending you his photo now.
Run it through Facial Rec,
let me know when you get eyes on him.
Roger that.
There's a staircase off that corridor.
It takes us to holding. That's where the phone is.
Over here! There's someone in there.
No time to be a hero.
You can't be in here!
Let go of me!
Open it!
You hear me? I'm not going to ask you again!
Open it.
I... I can't.
I don't have the key.
Where is it?
Are you all right?
It's okay. I'm a cop.
You're the one they're looking for.
Yeah.
Leilani.
I'm Chin Ho Kelly.
There's a phone in holding, so, we can...
we can call for help in there.
That's where we're heading,
but we got to go right away, okay?
Okay.
Too late, kids. Holding's not an option.
Kaleo's guys are all over it.
I've got a master key.
Get me to C-Block, and I'll get us out.
Okay.
Let's go.
I got a hit. I found Delano.
Are you sure it's him?
It's him. Facial Rec confirmed it.
He's on his way out of the Ilikai Hotel right now.
That's two blocks from here.
That's him. Get your hands up. Five-O.
Look at me. Where's Chin Ho Kelly?
You see that, Officer?
That's assault.
I'd like to press charges.
You do that.
There's a number here you've been calling a lot.
Why don't we call 'em,
see if they know where Chin is?
Delano, can't talk right now.
We're in lockdown.
But it's done. Kaleo will take care of Kelly.
Chin's in Halawa Prison.
This way.
That's C-Block there.
They're getting closer.
All right. Go get the door open.
We'll try and hold 'em off.
Come on.
Good to see you again, Lieutenant.
No!
I found him. The cop's down here.
What are you doing?
It's about survival.
If Kaleo finds out I've been helping you,
we're both dead.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Back off! Back off!
Bring him to Kaleo alive.
Go! Go!
Steve.
How bad is it?
The inmates have taken control of the Maximum Security.
Whole place is still on lockdown.
Warden's not letting anyone in.
Did you find Chin yet?
Surveillance tapes from earlier today prove he's inside.
We just can't get a lock where.
Warden Grier.
Warden Grier, one of my men is inside.
I just found out, Commander.
We're doing everything we can,
but I have a riot on my hands,
and I have a protocol.
You have a protocol?
Where was your protocol
when Lieutenant Kelly was locked in your prison?
Guards under your supervision conspired to do this.
This happened on your watch.
What's your plan of action to get my man out of there?
A dozen of my men are unaccounted for.
Some injured, some worse.
I won't risk any more lives.
Lieutenant Kelly's on his own.
We're going in now.
Got my bird all warmed up for you, sistah.
Why's SWAT not taking care of business?
They got a whole flock of choppers ready to go.
'Cause the warden won't let anything up in the air
over Halawa till he gives the go-ahead.
And we're not waiting for permission.
Hey, I got 62 more payments on this girl.
Be gentle, please!
You may want to step back.
You and me-- we've had our issues.
But bringing you this cop means we're all good, you feel me?
Sure. I feel you.
Lieutenant.
Glad we'll be able to finish what we started.
Things are different, little more painful,
when you can't hide behind the badge and gun.
You're not better than us.
You're one of us.
You belong here.
You turned on other cops,
locked me up.
I only survived because of one man--
Frank Delano.
The man you killed.
Delano...
murdered my wife.
He would've killed my cousin
and me, too, if he had the chance.
His brother... don't see it that way.
He put me in here.
And now you die.
Kaleo!
You're making a mistake.
Why do you care what happens to him?
I don't.
I care what happens to me.
You know this guy ain't just some cop.
He's Five-O.
Sure, you kill him, you get a few seconds of satisfaction--
but this man's your leverage.
You keep him alive a little while longer...
you just might buy yourself a ticket out of here.
Call them, Kaleo.
Call Five-O.
Find out what they're willing to trade for him.
On second thought...
why would I trust a snitch
who gave me up to Five-O?
Put him in a cell.
I'll deal with him later.
There's Chin!
Chin.
Let's get out of here.
Not yet.
Hey, where you going?
Follow me.
This way.
Leilani!
Leilani!
Chin! Chin!
These are my friends.
They're gonna get us out of here.
Follow me.
Okay, can we go now, please?
One more.
This way.
These are the guys who took Sang Min.
Well, where the hell is he?
He's right here.
He's gone.
I need a trauma team on standby.
I'm bringing Lieutenant Kelly in by helicopter.
I was wasting my time asking these amateurs.
But I know my bruddah Chin, he gonna...
he gonna let me know the truth.
What you think?
The breakfast burrito's a...
It's a tough nut to crack, brah. Um...
Maybe you stick with plate lunches for a little while, yeah?
You know? I think that's a...
fantastic idea.
What do you guys know?
You guys just don't appreciate culinary genius.
Sorry. Hope I'm not interrupting.
No. No, of course not. Come in. Please.
Hi. How you feeling?
Uh... better.
Thanks.
Let me ask you something, sistah.
Do you like spam?
I grew up on the stuff.
You ever do any food presentation modeling?
I could use a pretty spokeswoman.
Uh, no, thank you. I already have a job.
But, um, thanks for the kind offer.
Let me know.
Okay, well, I think we should all get going.
Give our jailbird some rest.
Okay.
But before you guys go, uh...
just know that I wouldn't be here without you guys.
Mahalo.
We're ohana, brah.
Love you, cuz.
Get some sleep.
Yeah, take care, brah.
Hey, anything you need, brah.
You got my back, right?
That's right.
So, I didn't just come by to check up on you.
I wanted...
to thank you for saving my life.
Oh. Well, you're welcome.
Thank you.
A nail file?
Yes, well, I figured, you know, you didn't have one;
otherwise, you would have used it.
That's good.
Thank you.
Hey, how's Chin doing?
Doctor said he's tough.
He should be out of the hospital in a couple of days.
Oh, that's great news.
Yeah.
What about you?
Are you okay?
Hey, I want some wine.
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Okay?
Yeah.
Hey, you feeling white or red tonight?
you know... maybe...
maybe red.
Come on.
Here you go.
Nice.
