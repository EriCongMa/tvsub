katrina bennett said she &apos;d put the deal through
if you offered her a job .
you bribed her .
you bet your ass i did .
i decided to farm out the case .
let me guess-- daniel hardman .
he &apos;s baiting you into breaching confidentiality .
and i &apos;m ready to bite down and drag him in with me .
she was younger than you , prettier than you ,
and of child @-@ bearing age--
all of the things you are not , and you fired her for it .
you can &apos;t be the named defendant on a gender @-@ discrimination case
while we &apos;re suing folsom foods for the same thing .
i am not capitulating to that man .
you have 45 cases you can &apos;t afford .
any way you slice it , i &apos;m going to bleed you dry .
i put my reputation on the line to close maria .
sheila , please .
i think you should go .
meet ms. dana scott .
scottie .
harvey .
oh , you two know each other ?
we went to harvard law together .
i &apos;ve been here longer than 75 % of our associates ,
and i love it ,
and that &apos;s what i told them in my essay .
i &apos;m going to harvard .
when i get back to london , i &apos;m getting married , harvey .
what would you like me to say ?
i &apos;m hanley folsom , president of folsom foods .
recently we &apos;ve been victim to terrible allegations
that we &apos;ve been discriminating against women .
we &apos;re in places like marysville ,
places where women want more than just jobs .
they want homes , families , and we support that .
and if they want advancement , we support that too .
got to give it to him .
his food might suck ,
but he makes a mean bullsh-- pie .
okay , please don &apos;t put that image in my mind .
i &apos;m eating . thank you .
what &apos;ve you got there-- vomit bagel ...
feces pancakes ?
look , i don &apos;t care what he says .
this is a man who won &apos;t promote women .
i want to steal a page from your book .
i already checked . there &apos;s no hot @-@ mic footage from this .
then interview the cameraman
or the sound guy , whatever it takes .
we need to catch this guy in a lie .
i already tried to hire an investigator .
the authorization got kicked back .
do it anyway . i &apos;ll take care of it .
we need to talk about resources .
we do .
i hear clients &apos; calls aren &apos;t being returned .
hardman put seven cases on the fast track .
the rest have to take a backseat .
we can &apos;t just hang our clients out to dry .
we won &apos;t .
at 10 : 00 a.m. , the library will be packed .
instead of returning 113 calls ,
i &apos;m going to take an hour
and give them the state of the union .
oh , good .
not good enough .
i need 40 more contract lawyers , a dozen paralegals .
and mike ross just told me
he couldn &apos;t even hire an investigator .
that &apos;s right . he can &apos;t .
we have to .
no .
we need to invest in this .
did you hear me ?
we bit this off . we need to chew .
you &apos;re like a toddler . no .
all of these are bills .
we knew what we were getting into .
and then we took a hit from monica eton .
and hired the contract lawyers ,
we are out of money .
use the line of credit .
it &apos;s gone .
what ?
they have evaluated the situation ,
and they know we &apos;re bleeding .
so we &apos;ve got seven cases in seven cities
over the next two months .
so what are you proposing i do ?
okay , what do you have for me ?
rachel .
rachel ?
what &apos;s going on ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m working .
on what ?
one of the seven cases is in massapequa ,
so i &apos;m seeing if one of the cities nearby
might have a private investigator .
okay , so that &apos;s a map of boston .
you &apos;re on what we commonly refer to as the internet .
and then , up here ,
you would just write &quot; private investigator . &quot;
but then i wouldn &apos;t be able to see
what part of town i want to live in
when i go to harvard .
okay , so basically you haven &apos;t been working
for the last , what , 15 minutes ?
half hour ...
45 minutes .
come on .
i am sorry .
i don &apos;t deal well with waiting .
you &apos;ve done everything that you can do , all right ?
you killed the lsats .
you had a great interview . you &apos;re a legacy .
you &apos;re smoking hot .
they don &apos;t let people in because they &apos;re hot .
i would .
you do realize we &apos;re working on a gender @-@ discrimination case .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing-- working .
and hopefully that &apos;s what you &apos;ll be doing now too .
change of plans .
welcome to the team , hottie .
we &apos;re consolidating resources .
jessica didn &apos;t approve the investigator ?
jessica approved anything we want ,
for one case .
what ? no , we have to fight them all .
and we will .
by letting six of them go ?
do you know how we won world war ii ?
yeah , of course . spock didn &apos;t let kirk save joan collins
from getting hit by that car .
wrong . we &apos;d already won .
kirk just would have changed the course of history .
i accept that .
eisenhower had 156,000 men
for 8 possible invasion points , which means--
19,500 men per point .
otherwise known as nothing .
he had to put everything that he had into one attack ...
normandy .
so the question is , where the hell is our normandy ?
that &apos;s easy . bakersfield .
lowest percentage of female promotions ,
highest percentage of female applicants .
and hanley folsom &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law runs the plant .
exactly .
you want to launch an attack , you launch it from bakersfield .
hey , am i spock or kirk ?
uhura .
walked right into it .
i got you an espresso , quad shot .
i don &apos;t need coffee .
you might .
i &apos;m fine .
what ?
oh , your suit &apos;s a little--
it &apos;s a client meeting , not a bachelor auction .
yeah , about that--
what , are there too many clients to fit in the library ?
we &apos;re using the conference room .
they won &apos;t all fit .
they will .
there &apos;s been a slight complication .
donna--
you will understand when you get there .
now you &apos;re ready .
donna .
scottie ?
harvey .
how &apos;s married life ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
divorced so soon ?
i never took the plunge .
oh , get over yourself .
i know i came here last time with cold feet
and blubbered over you like a 15 @-@ year @-@ old .
but it wasn &apos;t about you .
it was about me .
so what &apos;s it about this time ?
bakersfield .
you are not taking my clients , scottie .
we already did .
like taking candy from a little harvard baby .
you just said it wasn &apos;t about me .
harvey , bakersfield is everything , and i &apos;ve got them .
i &apos;ve also got appointments with the rest .
so i can spend time going after them and get 20 more ,
or you could let me have 10 and we call it a day .
well , why don &apos;t i just give it all to you ?
my cases , office , my wallet , my keys--
it &apos;s not personal . it &apos;s just business .
yeah , my business .
good business .
the answer is no .
well , there &apos;s no harm in asking .
it &apos;s good to see you , though .
you look great .
a bit overworked , but ...
not bad for a guy your age .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me . she took bakersfield ?
and she &apos;s looking for ten more .
a woman that goes after what she wants .
you sound impressed .
you don &apos;t .
i already work with a woman like that every day .
maybe i should have hired her when i had the chance .
what chance ?
there was one opening that year ,
and she was the best on paper ,
but i had already invested so much in you
that i decided to get a return on my investment .
which is what i &apos;m going to give you right now ,
even though you don &apos;t have any more money to invest .
are you back to resources ?
because i &apos;ve had enough of hearing about our weaknesses .
i &apos;m talking about turning it into one of our strengths .
i &apos;m listening .
hardman knows we &apos;re tapped out .
he &apos;s counting on it .
what if we &apos;re not ? what if we &apos;re flush ?
are you talking about joining forces with her ?
with her firm ...
her infinitely deep @-@ pocketed firm .
harvey , she wanted ten cases .
you &apos;re talking about sharing 45,
and i &apos;ve never known you to share .
they &apos;re based in london , so we &apos;ll be running the show .
they &apos;ll just be signing the checks .
and taking a cut of the winnings .
exactly . winnings .
it &apos;s the best way to beat hardman .
and the side benefit is you don &apos;t lose to scottie .
nothing wrong with a side benefit .
fine . don &apos;t lose to her .
but you better make damn sure that you don &apos;t lose with her .
good . you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m taking the personnel files ,
you go through the corporate minutes , and--
excuse me ?
bakersfield . we don &apos;t have all day .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know you were on bakersfield .
well , i am . let &apos;s go .
the minutes are over there ,
and they &apos;re not going to read themselves .
okay , well , you may be on bakersfield ,
but i &apos;m the lead on bakersfield ,
and we &apos;re not going to do any of that stuff
until we get harvey some up @-@ to @-@ date statistics .
4.7 % female executives . up to date .
that &apos;s a number .
we need the probability of that ratio being chance
across 22 divisions in 45 states , which is one--
one in 8.3 billion .
how did you know that ?
i checked with the statistician .
yeah , well , he &apos;s wrong , because he didn &apos;t--
adjust for outliers , which takes it to--
one in 6.4 billion .
how did you know that ?
i did it in my head .
it &apos;s what i do .
it &apos;s why i &apos;m lead ,
and if you don &apos;t know , you better ask somebody .
i don &apos;t need to ask anybody
to know that if we use the 8.3 billion number ,
it &apos;s defensible , and it skews the results in our favor .
oh , what a shock .
you want to skew the results
at the expense of our credibility .
we &apos;re not doing it .
i am a fifth year , mike .
and i work for harvey .
well , jessica assigned me .
and if you don &apos;t like that , why don &apos;t you go talk to her ?
i don &apos;t want to work with katrina .
she comes in . she takes over .
she acts like everything is her idea .
then we &apos;re in the same boat ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to work with scottie .
we &apos;re working with scottie ?
i &apos;m working with scottie .
she &apos;s coming to bakersfield with us ?
she &apos;s coming to bakersfield with me .
how can you do that to me ?
i didn &apos;t do it to you . she did . she stole them .
wait . what ?
relax , okay ?
you &apos;re going to go on another road trip someday .
no , harvey , you &apos;re not getting it .
we &apos;re going to lose world war ii .
what do you want ?
coffee ? tea ?
i &apos;m good , thanks .
a woman who wants nothing-- i distrust that .
who said i want nothing ?
oh , no one &apos;s ever said that about you .
oh , what have they said ?
&quot; they &quot; ?
you .
my opinion matters to you ?
your opinion matters to him .
i &apos;ve only ever said good things about you , scottie .
but what have you thought ?
just don &apos;t screw with him .
don &apos;t screw with him , or don &apos;t screw him ?
are you able to do one without the other ?
the other what ?
i &apos;ll leave you two to business .
so are you going to take me up on my offer ,
or are you going to fight me ?
you tell me .
i think neither .
i think you want us to try the cases together
and let my firm bankroll the litigation .
which is exactly what you wanted the whole time .
you got me . we &apos;ll start with bakersfield .
you couldn &apos;t just go for the direct approach ?
you don &apos;t respond to the direct approach , harvey .
you like to feel you can come to things on your own .
which is why we &apos;re not starting with bakersfield .
it &apos;s the clear choice .
exactly .
you knew it , my first year knew it ,
and so will hardman .
i &apos;m not afraid of hardman .
you should be .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to parkville .
you mean the one division with a female manager
and the best ratio of women executives
in the entire company ?
no , i mean the one division
where hardman will never think to find us .
because it &apos;s the dumbest place to start
and the hardest place to win .
and when we win it , all the others will surrender .
what a surprise--
harvey specter wants to do things the hard way .
what a surprise--
dana scott &apos;s looking for the shortcut .
and what makes you think that he &apos;s not going to find out
that we &apos;re not still going to bakersfield ?
we &apos;re still going to bakersfield .
we book a plane , a hotel ,
line up depositions there and in all seven cities .
that plan isn &apos;t worthy of our kind of money .
if you want to overwhelm hardman ...
we go to all 45 cities ...
which is exactly what you wanted the whole time .
you got me .
hey , um , i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry
and that you were right .
jessica assigned you ,
so you should take the lead on bakersfield .
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;ve got other things . i &apos;ll be fine .
good . you &apos;re both here . change of plan .
uh , no need . i already know , so ...
this isn &apos;t about parkville .
i &apos;m deposing hanley folsom in 36 hours ,
and i need to know more about him than his mistress does
before he gets here .
he has a mistress ?
that would help , wouldn &apos;t it ?
and you should already know , since you asked on this case .
now find me something .
what are you pissed about now ?
jessica assigned you ?
no , you asked .
i asked , and she assigned me .
that &apos;s how it works .
when you phrased it to me , you picked language
that skewed a little bit in your favor .
like you just said , &quot; i &apos;ve got other things , &quot;
instead of telling me the focus of the entire case
apparently just moved to parkville ,
which i don &apos;t have a problem with ,
but clearly you have a problem with me .
my problem with you is how you got here .
that &apos;s funny ,
because my problem with you is how i got here .
what the hell are you talking about ?
harvey offered me a job ,
and i thought it was because i &apos;d impressed him .
then you showed up , ready to break privilege ,
and i knew the real reason .
he was hiring me to protect you .
right , and then after you found out
the real reason for the offer ,
you went to harvey , and you said ,
&quot; i can &apos;t possibly accept employment under those circumstances . &quot;
oh , wait . no , you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re damn right i didn &apos;t , because i couldn &apos;t ,
because i had already given notice .
stop taking everything so personally
and get over it .
tell me you are not having ...
it &apos;s nice .
&quot; nice &quot; ?
should we have taken your jet ?
oh , wait . you don &apos;t have a jet .
it &apos;s hard to park them in manhattan .
oh , right . i forgot how provincial pearson hardman was--
one office , one city .
one office , the city .
what ?
it just occurred to me .
oh , let me guess .
there &apos;s an advantage to being on the same side .
well , we don &apos;t have to get the business out of the way
before getting to the pleasure .
there &apos;s also a disadvantage .
oh , let me guess . you have some rule .
i don &apos;t cook in my own kitchen .
you cook ?
it &apos;s a metaphor .
yeah , i got that . but you &apos;re in luck .
we are not in the same kitchen .
we are on this case .
somebody didn &apos;t read the paperwork .
when do i ever read the paperwork ?
we &apos;re still separate entities .
it &apos;s just a combined legal action .
mm , i like the sound of that .
i was hoping you would .
are you going to litigate me into sleeping with you ?
i &apos;m going to lead you right where you &apos;re dying to go .
how long until we land ?
long enough .
combined legal action .
you know , wait .
we didn &apos;t decide who &apos;s taking the lead on the deposition .
well , we could rock , paper , scissors for it .
or we can do this .
how will we know who won ?
oh , we &apos;ll know .
hey , sweetpants .
i feel like i never see you anymore ,
so i was wondering if you want--
oh , my god . what happened ?
you didn &apos;t get in .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i understand .
hey , rachel , i need your help .
um , yes . what do you need ?
i &apos;m ready to work .
listen , if you need help with any of it ,
i &apos;m going to be at my desk .
thanks , donna .
don &apos;t take it so personally .
what ?
that &apos;s what someone said to me .
and whenever someone says something &apos;s not personal ,
it is , because everything is personal .
i know .
what do you think hanley folsom &apos;s
personal opinion is on hiring women ?
uh , that he doesn &apos;t think we &apos;re good enough ,
but , i mean , it &apos;s not like he would say it out loud .
not at work .
which is why you need access to his personal correspondence .
exactly .
that &apos;s outside the scope .
well , let &apos;s find a way to put it inside the scope .
do you have any ideas ?
no , but i have 62 boxes
and 12 hours to find an idea .
exactly what i need to do-- let &apos;s go .
i told you i &apos;d win .
maybe i let you win .
you &apos;ve never let anybody win anything in your whole life .
why would you start now ?
now i get to demand a rematch .
and i get to lead the deposition .
parkville , missouri--
of all the places to run into you , harvey .
glad you could make it .
i almost didn &apos;t .
i was on my way to bakersfield--
after all , harvey specter had a flight booked there--
when , suddenly , i had a thought .
what would harvey do ?
so i checked ,
and dana scott &apos;s flight plan was here .
can &apos;t get around those pesky f.a.a. regulations , can you ?
i hope you &apos;ve got all the cities covered ,
&apos;cause we &apos;ve got people everywhere .
deep pockets .
dana scott . a pleasure .
i can &apos;t say the same .
you do like strong women , harvey .
and you don &apos;t like women at all .
oh , she &apos;s cute .
this should be fun .
oh , i &apos;m just getting a call from my niece
who needs help with her homework .
what do you got ?
i know why they promoted cathleen mitchell .
what is your title , ms. mitchell ?
vice president , regional services .
and how many management positions are there in your region ?
612 .
and how many of those are women ?
41 .
41 out of 612-- that &apos;s , uh , 6.6 % .
6.7 % , if you round up .
let &apos;s not .
and who sets the hiring policy ?
the hiring policy is that we hire
the best applicant for each job .
i &apos;m confused .
are women inherently inferior , then ?
no .
well , then why is it that your company
doesn &apos;t want to promote women into positions of power ?
i am in a position of power .
yes , but you &apos;re not exactly like other women , are you ?
harvey ?
you applied four times for management ,
and you &apos;ve been rejected every time ,
due to reviews containing the terms
&quot; aggressive , &quot; &quot; hostile , &quot; and &quot; overly ambitious . &quot;
and then , suddenly , you were &quot; dedicated , &quot;
&quot; hardworking , &quot; and &quot; a team player . &quot;
people change , harvey .
and the last i checked , you have to ask a question .
i will , and it &apos;s about that change .
were you diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2009 ?
that is not relevant .
are you married ?
what does that--
do you have any children ?
no .
can you have any children ?
this is beyond the pale , harvey , even for you .
should i read your deposition of jessica pearson
from two weeks ago ?
that &apos;s a different case and inadmissible here .
did you or did you not have a hysterectomy
that rendered you unable to have children
nne months before you were promoted ?
she is not going to answer .
maybe not today .
but it will become part of the record .
hanley folsom only promotes
women whose attention to home and family isn &apos;t in question .
except for one thing .
mr. folsom didn &apos;t know .
so you say .
he didn &apos;t know because i didn &apos;t tell anybody ,
because it &apos;s my business .
still , he found out , and that &apos;s why you were promoted .
harvey , that &apos;s enough .
will you look at that , harvey ?
even ms. scott understands that being childless and unmarried
doesn &apos;t make you damaged goods .
but if that &apos;s how you &apos;re framing your argument ,
good luck .
we &apos;ll see you in bakersfield ...
and everywhere else .
how could you not tell me that she &apos;d had a hysterectomy ?
because i just got the information on my way into the room .
you could have taken five seconds to fill me in .
i didn &apos;t fill you in because i wasn &apos;t sure you could play good cop .
because you weren &apos;t sure that i could play it ,
or because even when we &apos;re on the samside , you still want to win ?
if i told you , you wouldn &apos;t be pissed off .
now you can go to her and call me an asshole with conviction .
you &apos;re an asshole .
wait a second .
you &apos;re accusing me of still trying to win ?
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s still trying to win something .
you know , i should have known .
it &apos;s never the whole story with you .
what the hell &apos;s really going on ?
you beat me last time .
and ever since then , edward darby hasn &apos;t seen me
as worthy of being a name partner .
cooke would never allow that to happen , anyway .
he can &apos;t stand americans .
cooke retired ,
and he decided there &apos;s more to life than work .
so , if you deliver a huge win ...
i get my name on the door .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me that ?
you always respond to strength , not weakness .
look at that . you really did fool me .
if i had known that you were that good a performer ,
i would &apos;ve let you be good cop .
cooke really decided there &apos;s more to life than work ?
yep .
pussy .
pussy .
um , where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been right here .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
i finished going through everything .
me too . it &apos;s all catalogued . it &apos;s right there .
okay , good , &apos; cause i got to get it to--
where &apos;s 15 through 20 ?
the boxes are right there , rachel .
what &apos;s the matter with you ? come on .
you &apos;re late .
katrina handed me her briefs an hour ago .
um , yeah , i &apos;ve , uh-- i got most of mine .
most ?
if i can &apos;t count on you for the effort ,
how the hell am i supposed to count on you for the results ?
i &apos;m sorry . it was my fault .
um , i &apos;ll get it done .
too late .
now i have to call daniel hardman
and postpone and look like a fool .
thank you , mr. ross .
mike--
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
get it done .
rachel ?
yes .
katrina bennett . we haven &apos;t met yet .
oh , i @-@ i know who you are . welcome .
louis says you &apos;re the best paralegal around .
thank you .
i need 40 copies of these ,
and if you can duplicate the tabs
and have it back to me within in an hour ,
i will be eternally in your debt .
uh , katrina , i &apos;m so sorry . i just can &apos;t .
i &apos;m too busy right now .
too busy on what ?
i &apos;m going back through discovery to see if i can find a door
into folsom &apos;s personal correspondence .
that &apos;s a wild @-@ goose chase . who put you on that ?
mike ross .
well , i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re busy
working on something for a first year .
but the managing partner asked me to do something ,
and i didn &apos;t tell her i was too busy .
right .
this is for the same managing partner .
yes , but she didn &apos;t ask for it .
mike ross did .
look , i know you &apos;ve taken your lsats ,
and you may well be ready to be a lawyer .
but right now you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re a paralegal .
i &apos;m doing my job , and i need you to do yours .
rachel , do me a favor ?
can you just put that on pause for a sec ?
&apos;cause i need to make a copy .
no , louis , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m busy doing my job .
excuse me ?
what , do you want to fire me like you fired harold ?
because honestly , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t give a shit .
i get it .
rachel , listen , i know about the harvard thing .
and i think it &apos;s great .
what ?
yeah , norma told me .
rachel , i know the waiting is hard ,
but you &apos;re not going to be here for much longer .
i got 100 % faith in you .
i didn &apos;t get in .
what ?
i don &apos;t understand . i had everything--
my grades , the lsats , i &apos;m a legacy ,
and i don &apos;t even puff myself up ,
but i killed it at that interview .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
and do you remember that woman who came from harvard ?
she didn &apos;t like anyone , but i swear , she loved me .
sheila ?
yeah . sheila--sheila zass .
you remember .
yeah , i remember .
is there something wrong ?
yep , there is something wrong .
i believe you were wronged .
i believe you suffered
the slings and arrows of outrageous wrongness .
and i will not have it .
what does that mean ?
that means that i &apos;m going to rectify this situation ,
because you , miss zane , you &apos;re going to harvard .
looks like somebody had a good trip .
not exactly .
though the plane ride was fun .
as long as you didn &apos;t hit any turbulence .
jessica wants to see you .
i &apos;ll be right back .
actually , she wants to see both of you .
jessica wants to see me too ?
not exactly . your boss wants to see you .
i &apos;ll just ask the concierge to find something--
hello .
ah , dana .
and this must be the man himself .
edward darby .
he doesn &apos;t seem stodgy at all , or that old .
you should see me in my altogether .
pass .
fair enough .
edward stopped in to take stock of his investment .
so how are we ?
we &apos;re right on schedule .
dana ?
we &apos;ve dropped a grenade . we &apos;re just waiting for it to go off .
meaning it hasn &apos;t .
rome wasn &apos;t built in a day .
excellent point . i needn &apos;t have crossed the pond .
and yet , here you are .
well , as i confessed to jessica ,
i have an ulterior motive in our little venture .
daniel hardman .
i &apos;ve had the distinct displeasure .
so i have asked him to step it up a notch .
nice . attack him on all fronts .
we have clients everywhere .
finding a bone of contention with him
seemed the least i could contribute .
along with 12 million pounds .
i hate talking numbers . i prefer raking them in .
well , i &apos;ve done what i came to do .
now i &apos;m going to get out of your way .
nice to put a face to all this .
and a lovely face , it turns out .
thank you , edward .
i was referring to your man .
i &apos;ll be waiting for that detonation .
i trust it will come through .
you wanted to see me ?
yeah .
i wanted to explain about earlier .
you don &apos;t have to . it &apos;s fine . i overreacted .
okay , then i won &apos;t .
i will just tell you i found what you needed .
what , like you went through the rest of the files ?
no . i found what you needed .
access ?
hanley folsom .
personal ?
bingo .
oh , my god , that couldn &apos;t have come at a better time .
i would have found them for you sooner ,
but i had to copy some bullshit for katrina .
why didn &apos;t you just tell her you were working for me ?
i told her exactly what i was doing for you .
and she didn &apos;t-- oh , god .
never mind . i get it . she did the same thing to me .
she pulls that fifth @-@ year crap ,
and then you don &apos;t feel like dealing .
you have no idea .
what do we have ?
enough for you to write a motion .
he seems nice .
he was pissed .
that was pissed ? what does happy look like ?
he &apos;s british-- pretty much the same thing .
then how &apos;d you know he was pissed ?
wouldn &apos;t you be ?
i am .
we haven &apos;t turned cathleen mitchell yet .
your good cop failed .
no , your move failed .
well , jessica took it well .
because she had company . i &apos;ll hear about it later .
does he do that--
just pop in for a spot of tea ?
it &apos;s 12 million pounds .
you weren &apos;t expecting him .
no ...
i wasn &apos;t .
but this is a big investment for him , harvey .
his investment is only money .
for me , it &apos;s my whole firm .
excuse me . harvey , do you have a minute ?
you got here just in time . i &apos;m getting us access .
hanley folsom ?
bingo .
well , if you &apos;re talking about the july 29th reference
in his business email to his personal email ,
then you &apos;re too late .
what ?
katrina gave me the subpoena an hour ago .
i guess it &apos;s a good thing jessica put her
on the case after all .
when people steal from me , i take it personally .
are you subpoenaing me ?
you diverted rachel .
and then you pursued my idea yourself .
your idea ?
are you denying it ?
no , you said we needed to fly , so i built an airplane .
and then flew it right into harvey &apos;s office
just in time to take credit .
i offered you a chance to work together .
you didn &apos;t want to take it .
you &apos;ve always got an answer .
and you &apos;ve always got an accusation .
so either run to harvey
and tell him your little tale of woe ,
or get to work prepping for folsom ,
like i am .
louis .
sheila .
where &apos;s my interviewee ?
i dispatched him .
that &apos;s unacceptable .
you are unacceptable .
excuse me ?
you behaved unprofessionally .
i never behave unprofessionally .
okay , fine .
ski mask and coconut oil ?
that was personal .
but you let the personal color the professional ,
and rachel zane will not be a casualty
of your misplaced anger .
&quot; misplaced &quot; ? you made me look the fool .
i looked the fool .
you were collateral damage-- not my fault .
and it certainly wasn &apos;t ms. zane &apos;s fault .
so you &apos;re here to be her knight in shining armor .
i &apos;m here to right a wrong .
how very--
very what ?
noble .
yeah , it is .
and you &apos;re going to undo this .
i am .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
but it &apos;s what you &apos;ve caused .
i ...
will not be denied .
then come reap what you &apos;ve sowed .
have at you .
joust me .
i don &apos;t care what it takes .
we need to get to that smoking gun before katrina does .
she already found it .
katrina gave it to missy dietler to make copies .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s already in jessica &apos;s hands by now .
wait a minute . missy dietler ?
she &apos;s going to take four coffee breaks before she &apos;s done .
she &apos;s going to take four coffee breaks
before she finishes her coffee break .
which means it &apos;s probably still
in the copy machine right now .
missy &apos;s not going to leave the documents
just sitting in the copy machine .
no , but she probably already scanned them .
so all we need is her code .
you &apos;re talking about stealing someone &apos;s work .
mm , someone who lied to you , stole from me ,
and made us both look like fools .
look , if you have any qualms , think about it .
we &apos;re all on the same team .
the faster this gets done , the better for everyone .
oh , you got an answer for everything .
well , so does she .
are you sure you want to do this ?
yes .
uh , whoa . what are you doing ?
manningham &apos;s had a crush on me since the day i got here .
he would give me his mother &apos;s social security number
if i asked him for it .
okay , rachel , we don &apos;t have much time .
i need a sure thing here .
mike ...
i am a sure thing .
yeah , i mean , give it a shot .
it probably won &apos;t work , but , um ...
that was brutal , deliciously brutal .
and your act of vengeance raised my ire .
you , sir , are a knight .
and now it is time to right what is wrong .
look , sheila , i &apos;m flattered by what you did ,
but this is not fair ,
and you know it can &apos;t stand .
louis , pull a resume from the stack--any one .
read it .
sure .
magna cum laude , yale , 3.9 gpa .
another one .
summa cum laude , georgetown , 4.3 gpa .
listen , i get it . i know what you &apos;re trying--
that &apos;s my reject pile .
i am a professional .
i would never let my feelings for you
sway me against a candidate .
okay , but you have to let them
sway you for a candidate .
you can &apos;t ask me that .
rachel zane is the best paralegal
in the best law firm in new york .
she is relied upon by the best lawyers
who have graduated from the best university .
the woman is crimson .
so who do i knock out ?
i promised her .
louis , i liked her . i did .
you &apos;re just going to have to tell her the truth .
sometimes good isn &apos;t good enough .
so how &apos;s that detonation coming ?
long fuse .
is that your way of telling me that it &apos;s never going off ?
well , if it doesn &apos;t ,
you could always have james bond take care of it for you .
that reminds me .
how are things going with pussy galore ?
um , i believe , at this point ,
she &apos;s still flying missions for goldfinger .
&quot; no , mr. bond , i expect you to die . &quot;
what the hell are you doing here ?
we can win parkville .
this is the key to everything .
well , then we need to get pussy galore back on that plane .
just remember what i told you .
no matter what happens--
well , if it isn &apos;t the three stooges .
oh , dibs on curly .
would you gentlemen mind accompanying us
to the conference room ?
what is she doing here ?
dana scott ?
she &apos;s the attorney of record on the case .
he &apos;s referring to my employee .
oh , well , at the moment , she &apos;s reading this .
an email you wrote from your personal account
on the subject of hiring ms. mitchell .
and next , we &apos;ll show her the attachment .
it wasn &apos;t on your copy .
oddly enough , it wasn &apos;t on ours either .
mike managed to find the original .
we &apos;ll need time to review this .
review it ? he wrote it .
you knew she couldn &apos;t have children .
that &apos;s why you changed her review ,
and that &apos;s why you promoted her .
and when she sees it , she &apos;ll join the suit ,
and you won &apos;t stand a chance .
that email doesn &apos;t prove a pattern .
it proves what he did to her .
it &apos;s one case .
we &apos;ll see you at the next 44 .
in the meantime ,
we won &apos;t be participating in that deposition
until you put ms. mitchell back on a plane .
how &apos;d it go ?
it &apos;s not over yet .
but you &apos;re out of the doghouse with jessica ?
out .
what ?
you never said how it went with manningham .
and i never will .
well , if it isn &apos;t bonnie and clyde .
what are you doing in my office ?
well , i didn &apos;t think you cared to respect what &apos;s yours
or , more to the point , what &apos;s mine .
your problem &apos;s not with her . it &apos;s with me .
okay .
you stole my discovery , and you know it .
oh , you mean that piece of paper
that i turned into a strategy ?
or , as you like to call it , an airplane .
okay , fine .
i put my toe over the line .
you obliterated it .
yeah . i &apos;m so sorry .
but yesterday you were the fifth @-@ year authority
on right and wrong , so i ...
i was just taking your advice .
and which side of right and wrong
does sleeping with the paralegals fall on ?
get the hell out of my office .
you &apos;re right . that &apos;s none of my business .
but it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re going to law school ,
because they may sleep with the paralegals ,
but they end up with the lawyers .
of course , when you called ,
i popped straight over , but i must say ,
you do keep uncivilized hours in the little apple .
it &apos;s the big apple .
well , then someone &apos;s just sold me a counterfeit t @-@ shirt .
a sense of humor-- i love that in a man ,
which is why i &apos;m prepared to consider
taking you up on your offer .
might i inquire what changed your mind ?
what &apos;s this ?
our books from the last five years .
if we &apos;re going to do this , i want you to know
exactly what it is you &apos;re getting yourself into .
now , start at the beginning .
it &apos;s a great read .
you are an impressive woman .
oh , you don &apos;t know the half .
well , here &apos;s to my further education .
you &apos;re late .
that &apos;s not going to get you out of buying me a drink first .
no more bullshit .
what ?
i just left jessica and your boss ,
and i know what i saw .
they &apos;re in bed together ,
and i don &apos;t mean having sex .
they &apos;re talking merger .
it &apos;s not what it looks like .
hardman can check a plane , and i can check a plane .
edward darby flew here the day you did .
he didn &apos;t just pop in .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to do that .
you don &apos;t want your name on the door .
you want your name on my door .
i want to see our names on the same door .
yeah , like i said ,
it &apos;s never the full story with you .
i wanted to be able to tell you myself .
then why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because he wouldn &apos;t let me until he decided .
well , evidently , he decided without you .
okay , okay . he jumped the gun .
but i have his promise , harvey .
if we merge , he names me as partner ,
and jessica &apos;s only choice is you .
i don &apos;t need you to get my name on the door
any more than i need you to win this case .
you know what , harvey ?
you have been outgunned ever since hardman left .
i am bringing the guns .
this is exactly what you &apos;ve always wanted .
get over your pride .
i &apos;m not getting over anything .
and this merger isn &apos;t happening .
jessica . edward .
daniel , haven &apos;t seen you since that business in milan .
beautiful weather .
oh , enough .
we are not friendly adversaries , daniel .
and you &apos;re about to lose .
my client already said no .
he may no longer listen to you
when i inform him of your prior embezzlement .
you told him .
i didn &apos;t tell him anything .
i found it on my own .
edward and i are merging .
i had to show him the books .
legally required to show me her books .
and unlike you , i don &apos;t break the law .
a fact that hanley folsom could be made acutely aware of .
you do break the law , jessica .
not reporting embezzlement is a crime .
why don &apos;t you bring that up at your sentencing hearing ?
why don &apos;t i sue you ?
you could .
anybody could sue anybody .
but you still don &apos;t have proof that i told him .
and our firms combined have ten times
the resources that yours d--
oh , wait . you don &apos;t have a firm .
you &apos;re just here , living in zane &apos;s offices ,
working on those cases that will no longer be yours
when we &apos;re done with you .
good @-@ bye , daniel .
get your client to sign those papers , will you ?
what is it , louis ?
got a hard truth to tell you .
i &apos;m not going to harvard .
no , you &apos;re not .
i get it .
i &apos;m not good enough . i never have been .
that is not the hard truth .
you are an amazing candidate ,
and you need to know this in your heart .
the truth is , you did not get in ...
because i let you down .
what are you talking about ?
sheila and i had a relationship .
i hurt her , and ...
and she took it out on me ?
i &apos;m going to write you a recommendation for anywhere ,
any law school .
it just ...
won &apos;t be harvard .
