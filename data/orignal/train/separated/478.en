Like, we really, we really shouldn't meet like this.
I know.
But, uh, we gotta talk about some things.
Everyone, this is our new section chief.
This is Agent Mateo Cruz.
You could have mentioned this.
I got word minutes after we had breakfast.
Cruz has risen through the ranks.
You ever heard of this Cruz guy?
Yeah, I've heard his name.
Every time your name was mentioned today
and every time I didn't say,
hey, yeah, I know him, I'm lying.
That case could stay open for a couple of years.
It's already been almost 3.
Can't we just say we're on assignment?
No one can know.
拨号中
If I were you,
I would save my strength.
2010年10月
Chief Strauss.
Agent Jareau.
Welcome.
I've been ordered to brief you on your new assignment.
You'll be splitting time between here and D.C.
So I haven't been drafted?
Your transfer to State was a necessary backstop.
This mission is code word classified.
Even the personnel reporting to you
will not know the nature of your work.
You need to change.
You just lost us a valuable asset.
Me? That terrorist got hurt trying to escape.
You were right.
He talked?
Yeah, well, he started to, and then this.
Agent Jareau, this is Mateo Cruz.
He's heading up the taskforce.
All right, follow me.
Hastings, do you have a minute?
Was this man tortured to death?
This man is al-qaeda operative Savin Mubari.
He was one of Bin Laden's couriers, and, yes, he was.
Didn't anyone tell you to get changed?
Hastings, why don't you say
hello to SSA Jennifer Jareau from the BAU.
She'll be handling female interrogations.
We don't need a profile if we know we're looking for Bin Laden.
I'm not a profiler.
I was the communications liaison.
Hell, then why is she even here?
Stand down. Jareau is a proven mediator.
Don't get comfortable. This places changes people.
I can't imagine what it'll do to someone like you.
Arrogance aside, Hastings is CIA elite, so...
How can you say that?
He just tortured a man to death.
The bureau and the CIA handle things differently, but...
Hastings didn't do this.
Who's the woman?
That's Nadia, Mubari's wife.
Does she know anything?
It's up to you to find out.
Agent Jareau,
this is Tivon Askari, our interpreter.
You'll be working closely with him on this assignment.
Very nice to meet you.
JJ's cell still hasn't shown up.
I'm telling you, Hotch, she's in trouble.
Garcia's tracking her car now.
Agent Sharp, will you take agent Jareau's son to my office?
It's an emergency.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
You go with her, love.
I found it. It's on the south side of the street.
They're here.
I'll let you know.
JJ's car parked on constitution.
Morgan and Reid are on their way.
Find Matt Cruz. He'll know what's going on.
Section chief Matt Cruz?
Grant, it's Garcia.
I need to speak to Matt Cruz.
That's why I couldn't tell you on the phone.
JJ made me promise.
Yeah, I know what time it is. Get him now.
Well, she was afraid someone was listening,
but what does Cruz have to do with JJ's disappearance?
They worked together at The State Department.
Neither one has mentioned that.
They couldn't. Their assignment was classified.
No, past tense.
JJ worked at The State Department years ago.
I thought that, too,
until Cruz was assigned here
and the secret calls and texts started again.
Look, all I know is, is JJ said if anything every happened to her
that Cruz would know what to do.
Sir, there's a problem.
Chief Cruz isn't answering
and GPS on his mobile isn't transmitting.
That's the same thing as JJ.
Garcia, have Rossi and Blake check out Cruz's house,
and, Anderson, put Agent Jareau's family in protective custody.
This is SSA Hotchner with the BAU.
I need to speak to the director.
They're trying to access Integrity!
We can't let them get our codes!
You have forgotten.
I know exactly how to get what I want.
"Why should we look to the past
in order to prepare for the future?
Because there is nowhere else to look."
James Burke.
The director's behind closed doors
with the Under Secretary of Arms Control and International Security Affairs.
Hotch is on his way to the State Department to get some answers.
We found JJ's cell phone, but there wasn't any sign of her.
Cruz is missing, too.
His car is still in his garage, but mail and newspapers
suggest that he's been gone at least 24 hours.
I'm trying.
I'm trying--I'm trying to pull data off of JJ's phone,
but it's like level 9 security.
It would make Snowden weep.
What about cell phone records?
Encrypted. JJ's and Cruz's.
That's not surprising if they work for the State Department.
But if that assignment was a backstop,
then JJ's transfer as D.O.D. liaison was her cover.
So what was she really doing that year?
That's the first question Hotch is gonna ask.
Strauss was pressured by the executive branch
to push JJ's transfer through in 2010,
so she would have known the reason why.
Any assignment Strauss authorized
would be archived in the SCIF.
That facility is code word classified.
Ok, but Anderson can get you in.
He archives those reports.
Blake, Rossi, JJ couldn't have used the SCIF
without drawing attention.
She probably has it foxholed right here in the BAU.
We just need to find it.
And what are you not telling us?
Whoever took Cruz and JJ is highly trained and highly organized.
Justice, Defense, and State--
They wouldn't be on edge like this
if this was a simple matter of two missing agents.
Is Hotch worried that the recovery won't be made a priority?
It's our job to find the leverage that assures it is.
Let's get it done.
The sooner you give me the security codes,
the sooner this can end.
Say yes if you understand.
What the hell is going on?
She just went crazy on me. I don't know where it came from.
Where's the doll?
What doll?
The doll. We need to find the doll.
It's ok. Calm down.
Where is the doll?
It was on the ground outside.
Translate, please.
Me?
That was your first step at developing rapport.
We need to build on that.
My name is Jennifer.
This is Michael.
Was that your child's?
Where is she?
Quetta.
She's in Pakistan.
Ok, uh, tell her if she gives us the names
of the men that dealt with her husband,
we'll reunite her with her daughter.
We can't tell her that.
Ok, we can, but we can't actually do it.
Jareau...
You understand, we can't launch a mission
to rescue one prisoner's daughter. Right?
Most of the files are kept on hard copy
to prevent digital espionage.
Ok. Good thing one of us reads 20,000 words per minute.
Time to get my spy face on.
This has to be JJ's foxhole.
It was her office when she was liaison.
Hotch handles most of the paperwork now,
but before JJ was a profiler,
she reviewed cases in here.
Well, she wouldn't hide anything too far out of reach.
All right, 4 digits. Any ideas?
Henry's birthday is November 12.
1112.
That's too easy.
Try 2008, the year she became a mom.
Yep.
What's Integrity?
I don't know.
But someone does.
华盛顿特区
Agent Hotchner,
we told you we were handling this.
Yes, Madame Secretary.
I thought it would be a good idea if we shared information.
Tell us what you know.
Well, it might save time if you told me
the true nature of Agent Jareau's reassignment in 2010.
She was D.O.D. liaison to the State Department,
but you already know that.
I know that that was her backstop.
I'm referring to something called "Integrity."
Clear the room, please.
"Integrity."
Garcia, cross-reference keyword "Integrity"
against Middle East operations dating back to 2010.
Focus specifically on military action
taken against Osama Bin Laden and/or Al-Qaeda.
Now we're talkin'.
What did you find?
A ghost file in a ghost folder
on a ghost server that nobody wants me to know about.
I'll have to resurrect some gigabytes.
So Agent Jareau was on a taskforce to find Bin Laden
and Integrity was the name of the operation?
No.
Integrity's the name of a database born out of that mission.
A failsafe put in place
to protect covert agents and operations.
You shouldn't even know it exists.
But agent Jareau and agent Cruz know,
and that's why they've been taken.
We believe so.
Both have the necessary codes to access the system.
Reid.
Why was JJ in the middle east?
And what were Cruz and Strauss doing there?
But she's already given us the names of two high-level terrorists.
to assure her family's safety,
she'll be even more willing to cooperate.
We can't risk U.S. casualties
trying to save a terrorist's daughter.
Well, she was married to one,
but Nadia is a mother first.
Look, she's clutching that doll
as if her life depends on it.
We put her daughter in her arms instead,
she'll tell us everything.
Agent Jareau has a valid point.
The child's definitely her achilles heel.
What if she's already given us everything?
Two terrorists her husband knew, OK.
But neither provided tangible leads to OBL.
She could be stalling.
And what if she's not?
What if she has one more name
that gets us Bin Laden?
Well, that's a risk worth taking.
OK, I'll contact Secretary Jackson.
All right, our fourth person is Michael Hastings,
CIA operative,
killed in action april 24, 2011.
Operation classified.
This isn't right.
The U.S. doesn't commemorate clandestine operations.
These are surveillance images.
So who took them?
The same person who killed Hastings.
Let's hope Hotch can find out who that was.
There are ongoing back channel negotiations we can't disrupt.
So agents Jareau and Cruz get written off?
I know they're your team,
but they're not your problem.
Who killed agent Hastings?
He was a senior member of the taskforce you assembled.
His name is Tivon Askari,
former Iraqi Special Forces.
A turned interrogator, Askari aided in debriefing informants.
He was our lead translator
until an attack on the taskforce
exposed him as a traitor.
Following the attack, Jareau and Cruz
uncovered among his belongings
surveillance images and detailed intelligence
on our own people.
Where is he now?
Askari went to ground,
we've been looking for him ever since.
Well, he wouldn't have resurfaced without a reason.
He knows how valuable access to something like Integrity
would be to our enemies,
and if you have no idea where he is,
then agents Cruz and Jareau
are running out of time.
What you need to do,
agent, is stand down.
We are handling this.
This needs to be managed a little more delicately
than by the coarse hands of the BAU.
What that means,
no more SCIF break-ins.
No more database searches.
Go back to chasing serial killers.
This is a State matter.
Yeah.
They just locked us out.
Is State doing anything to find JJ and Cruz?
No.
So what are we gonna do?
We call in reinforcements.
This is Prentiss.
Hotch, what's wrong?
Debrief me on the plane. I'm on my way.
Soon.
Extraction team is on approach.
They should have Nadia's daughter momentarily.
Helo's on the ground.
Roger, team 3, we are picking up activity in sector 9.
Extraction's in place. Go, go, go!
We've got a family.
Two adults, one child.
Can you confirm their identities?
It's the target. We have the girl.
Proceed with extraction.
We're taking fire!
Take cover.
Pull out of there. Pull out of there now!
Pull out!
That was an explosion.
All right, get them back on line.
Get them back on the line.
Team 3...
Team 3. This is overwatch Alpha. Come in. Over.
Team 3, report.
Team 3, this is overwatch Alpha. Report.
According to interpol data,
Askari is as bad as they get.
Highly educated member of the republican guard
caught torturing POWs off the clock for fun.
I'm sending you his profile now.
So this is who has JJ?
His name speaks volumes.
Tivon means "Student of Nature,"
yet Askari means soldier.
Askari's methods appear well documented.
He's organized, he's meticulous.
He typically spends 24 hours with his subjects before they break.
They've had Cruz at least that long.
It looks like this guy
uses most of the standard torture techniques.
He even keeps his ritual to an established timeline,
a so-called perfect methodology
evolved through years of practice.
No sexual torture.
Maybe he has lines he doesn't cross.
Typically, professional torturers are driven
by a false sense of moral superiority.
They don't derive sexual pleasure from the cruelty they inflict.
But Askari isn't just a torturer.
He's a sadistic serial killer.
And they love getting off.
Guys, I may have two more victims we can attribute to Askari.
Savin Mubari and his wife Nadia.
He was a known confidant to Bin Laden's.
Both were at the camp where JJ worked.
Then JJ would have been assigned to interrogate Nadia.
Do we know what happened to her?
M.O. matches all of Askari's victims except for one thing.
She was raped.
So what was different about her?
Maybe she lasted the longest.
If his ritual dictates a specific timeline,
any new aspect would fall later in his routine.
So the longer JJ holds out,
the greater the likelihood that'll happen to her.
So how much time does JJ have?
A few hours.
No, no, no, what are you doing?
It's ok.
You son of a bitch!
It's ok.
You have 5 seconds to give me what I want.
5...
4...
You kill him, your plan is ruined!
3
Stop counting!
2
Please!
1...
No.
No!
Let her down.
You don't have to come.
We know.
This is gonna destroy her.
It isn't your fault.
Like hell.
I was the one who said we should go get her daughter.
Nadia?
Nadia?
When war broke out, it looks like Askari's talents
were recruited by the regime to break potential informants
as well as captured U.S. Troops.
So Askari works for the highest bidder.
How does a guy who tortured U.S. soldiers
get drafted to our side?
Wait, I might know that.
I uploaded that ghost file
to my private cloud server.
The order was given by Chief Cruz.
Why would Cruz enlist a man like Askari?
He needed a high-ranking partner to put him in position.
So what are we saying, Cruz and Askari were working together?
Then JJ's in more danger than we thought.
Hey. Welcome back.
How was your trip home?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong. I'm pregnant.
Is that a good thing?
Yeah.
Yeah, Will and I have been trying.
It's just...
I never imagined finding out about it here.
Well, then...
congratulations.
Jareau.
There's a call for you from BAU.
Some kind of emergency involving Emily?
Who's Emily?
JJ.
God, you're freezing.
Emily.
How did you find me?
It doesn't matter.
It's taking everything.
I can't...
I think I might break.
You have to break.
No, I...
This has to end.
Matt...
How did you--
I thought you-- I thought you were dead.
I know. They're trying to break you.
I...I must be seeing things.
You have to break.
You can't take much more of this.
No...
The time has come to give up your security codes.
No...
Cruz never officially put his name in for section chief.
Well, somebody did.
Or he pulled strings, called in favors to get closer to JJ.
Emily, you saw JJ during this time.
Did she ever mention cruz or details of the investigation?
The first thing I'm doing
when we get to Paris is having this removed.
How could a brand hurt more than getting staked?
Maybe it's a psychosomatic itch you're scratching?
The brand left an emotional toll,
Doyle established dominance over you
by marking you as his.
A stake--I mean you overcame death.
The ultimate victory over your foe.
Why suffer a pain you're proud of?
Or you could always get another tattoo.
Yeah, something transformative, like a...
A phoenix.
Or a blackbird.
I love the song.
But something tells me I shouldn't tread in your waters.
Come on, JJ. Something's obviously different about you.
You commandeered an interpol jet.
You're profiling me.
Why didn't you say your transfer was a backstop?
Oh, I know that look.
The "I can't trust anyone but myself" look. I invented it.
Do you ever feel like you're in way over your head?
I got assigned to an information hunt.
Instead, I am chasing an unsub who killed my informant.
What would Hotch tell you to do?
Focus on victimology, let behavior lead the way.
Exactly.
Who did your unsub kill?
The one person I was getting through to.
Why?
Because I was getting through to...
I was getting through to her.
What if she was about to expose her killer?
Someone on the inside?
It sounds like it's time for you to be the blackbird and flip the script.
JJ suspected a double agent.
She could have been talking about Cruz.
If Cruz is working with Askari, why take JJ?
His clearance level is higher than hers.
At interpol, our most sensitive information
requires two ranking agents to gain access.
Maybe the Integrity systems require the same.
But when agents are compromised,
their security privileges are revoked.
JJ's codes shouldn't work.
If he knew what he was doing,
he could reroute the system updates
that would render their security codes useless.
Where would he have to do to do that?
Straight to the source.
He'd have to hard-line into the servers,
but they're scattered all over the country.
It would be difficult to transport JJ
and keep to Askari's timeline.
He must have taken her someplace local.
We need to figure out which server they've hacked.
It's ok.
It's ok.
请求文件: 诚信
Codes confirmed. Now we just need the second user.
I guess we don't need you anymore.
You hurt her, you'll never get my codes.
Ever.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
We're getting nowhere on your inside man theory.
It's because we've been looking in the wrong place.
Where should we be looking?
OPS.
You think the double agent's one of us?
It would be the perfect infiltration plan.
It's the only way the extraction of Nadia's daughter
would have been compromised.
The mission was need to know.
What are you proposing?
I'm not proposing anything.
We've been authorized to use an off-base location
for enhanced interrogation of our own people.
I can't believe Strauss signed off on this.
She didn't.
Jackson did.
You went over Strauss?
I didn't think you had it in you.
Too many people have died for us.
Hastings!
Fall back!
What have you got, Garcia?
I found the relevant servers.
How many were there?
D.C. Area, 6.
We need to narrow it down.
We can ping the servers to see who's hard-lined in.
But the second we start knocking,
FBI data security is gonna know.
It's not gonna be a big leap to figure out why we're doing this.
We won't be here when they do.
Ok. I'm going in.
It's not working. None of the servers are showing any active hard-lines.
Then we're back to square one.
No, no. We don't have time for that.
It's already been 24 hours.
JJ's beaming out of one of the sites.
We'll work our way down the list.
Ok, sir, I'm sending coordinates now.
What happened?
The convoy was attacked.
Hastings?
Taken, by Askari's men.
There's something else.
No.
No...no.
I'm so sorry.
Your code now,
or this time she loses more than her baby.
Go to hell.
Your code!
Did you tell him I was pregnant?
Of course not.
I never told anyone.
ok.
It's enough.
Come out.
Who are you talking to?
Not to you, to your boss.
Come out and face me, you coward.
Here, try this.
Tea? I'm not drinking tea. JJ's not drinking tea.
You need to calm down.
It's been 24 hours, Kevin.
Do you know what happens after 24 hours? Because I do.
What was that?
Blackbird.
What does that mean?
I have no idea.
It's JJ.
How did you know?
Askari couldn't possibly know that I was pregnant.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my husband.
I only told Matt,
right before you came and gave me that message from the BAU.
How long were you listening before you approached?
The Humvee attack proved
I was right about an inside man.
And look what it cost you.
You can threaten to kill me.
That won't give you what you want.
She's right.
Don't I know it.
But I also know you, Matt.
And what line you won't let me cross.
Jareau is your Achilles Heel.
And I don't blame you.
She is an attractive woman.
Don't touch her, you sick son of a bitch!
No more games.
I want Integrity.
She's the price.
No. No.
Maybe...
I can make you one.
Another one.
JJ must have logged in with a panic sequence
that triggered a silent alarm.
It's pretty standard protocol.
Enter your security codes backwards
and a preset alarm is activated,
in this case, blackbird.
Oh, God, JJ sent that alert 30 minutes ago.
They must have looped the system.
That's why I couldn't read any hard-lines.
Which of the servers send the message?
Hands where we can see them.
What--what--whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Utherlay oadchurchbray.
Utherlay oadchurchbray.
You don't need to be a linguist to recognize pig latin.
Luther and Broadchurch is the location of Cramer Industries.
It's a research and development company.
R and D -- that's gotta be a front for clandestine operations.
Hang on.
Take your time, Matt. I've been thinking about this for years.
Matt, don't.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ok, ok, that's it. Just stop!
I'll do it. Just stop.
Where's the server mainframe?
Subterranean level.
Which way is that?
Through the warehouse.
Show us.
We're in.
It worked.
Start with base security protocols and covert deployments.
Now that we have access...
I'll call for helo extraction.
Tell the men to meet me upstairs.
You know what to do.
We don't have it all.
We have enough.
It's Hastings. I don't see Askari.
Hastings!
Stop! No!
Thank you, Matt.
Matt...
No...
No.
Emily.
I knew they'd call you.
I knew it.
All right. Shh...
Are you ok?
I'm fine. Help Matt, please.
Hastings is headed to the roof.
You have to stop him.
Comms aren't working down here.
He's lost a lot of blood. How's JJ?
She's standing, but that's --
Where the hell did she go?
She went to get Hastings.
It's personal for her.
Go help her. I've got him.
Come on. Come on.
He's headed to the roof!
So is JJ.
I got you!
Can you give us a minute, please?
Matt, what you did...
I had your back.
Always did.
Thank you.
Jennifer...
Get some rest.
Nietzsche said, "When you look long into an abyss...
the abyss looks into you."
Emily, how much longer do we have you?
Um...6 hours.
It's too soon.
It's more than we had yesterday.
I'm just glad I finally got to meet you.
I've heard such amazing things.
All lies.
No. No more lies.
Nothing but the truth from now on.
Oh, yeah?
