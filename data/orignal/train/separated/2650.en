Guard Elizabeth, and when the time comes,
make sure Karakurt reaches the F.B.I. safely.
Where's Reven Wright?
Last time we talked,
she mentioned a Tommy Markin.
Laurel Hitchin is in the Cabal.
Why would Venezuela agree to such a ridiculous proposal?
The ability to print as much money as he'd like to print.
Elizabeth Keen, I'm here to escort you downtown,
where you'll be held safely pending your arraignment.
Gather your team.
It's time to take down the Cabal.
You're late.
Um, be careful with that. I'm not due for an upgrade --
♬You can run on for a long time♬
♬Run on for a long time♬
♬Run on for a long time♬
♬Sooner or later God'll cut you down♬
♬Sooner or later god'll cut you down♬
♬I've been down on bended knee♬
♬Talking to the man from galilee♬
♬He spoke to me in the voice so sweet♬
♬I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet♬
♬He called my name, and my heart stood still♬
♬When he said, "John, go do my will"♬
♬Go tell that long-tongue liar♬
♬Go and tell that midnight rider♬
♬Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter♬
♬Tell 'em that god's gonna cut 'em down♬
♬Tell 'em that god's gonna cut 'em down♬
My kinda girl.
♬Go tell that long-tongue liar♬
♬Go and tell that midnight rider♬
♬Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter♬
♬Tell 'em that god's gonna cut you down♬
Hello, Harold.
You look pretty well, considering.
Thank you all for coming.
I apologize for the security protocols,
but my better half insists.
Just the fact that you are all here
is a testament to the deep concern we share
for Elizabeth Keen's safety and well-being.
The threat from forces within is proving to be more powerful
and far-reaching than one could ever have imagined.
I've asked you here
because we have one chance to save Elizabeth.
But to do that, we must work together.
So...
Oh, my God,
this is why I'm a terrible bridge player.
With anyone else,
Steve Lyditt would have won the North American Pairs.
We didn't even make it through regionals.
I abhor working with a partner.
Sharing my hand with anyone goes against every instinct I have.
But such is life. Here we are.
So, five weeks ago,
I called the Metro P.D. to report
a sighting of Raymond Reddington at the Del Rio diner.
I created a hostage crisis so you would be so kind
as to release my attorney, Marvin Gerard, from prison.
That day, Marvin and I conceived a plan
to exonerate Elizabeth Keen by targeting the Cabal,
and, in particular, the Director.
Since that day, everything we've done
has been in service of that plan.
The Verdiant case
has resulted in catastrophic damage to the Cabal's finances.
The client list we took from the Djinn
gave us leverage with key players in the Cabal
to further isolate and weaken the Director's influence.
With Andras Halmi, or...part of him,
we cut a gaping hole
in the Director's golden parachute...
leaving him nothing to run with
and causing even further distrust
and divisions within the Cabal.
But the Zal Bin Hasaan has opened a window of opportunity
we must slip through with great haste.
To save Elizabeth,
we must execute a specific attack,
one so impactful,
it will force the Cabal to completely abandon the Director
and publicly exonerate Elizabeth Keen.
What the hell do you have in mind?
See, this is why I don't play well with partners.
Don't fret, Harold. I'm holding all the trumps.
I'll be the declarer, you be the dummy,
and we'll win the hand.
Anything else?
Good.
Let's begin.
第三季第十集
And we are over the convoy now,
as F.B.I. vehicles speed Agent Keen
to the federal courthouse.
Sources say she'll appear before a judge authorized to preside
over matters of top national security.
The name of that judge has not been released.
There is no record of the case on any official court document.
Local P.D. in West Virginia must've leaked the arrest.
I'm counting four choppers.
We're getting word of a crowd assembling at the courthouse, sir.
Might get a little messy.
They were gonna kill me.
The Director wasn't taking me to any black site for questioning
about actionable intel.
If you hadn't shown up when you did, I'd be dead.
I'm sorry, Keen.
I expected the Director to try something,
but I also expected Reven Wright to be there to intervene.
What happened?
I think Laurel Hitchin killed her...
or had her killed.
My God. They're in the White House.
Hey, look, Reven may be gone,
but the safeguards we put in place
for your arrest are still intact.
She arranged for your case to be heard by a judge
she trusted completely.
As much as she trusted Laurel Hitchin?
Pending trial,
you'll be housed under military guard at Fort Meade.
We can keep you safe there, Liz.
I wouldn't have brought you in if I didn't believe that.
I need a pen and paper.
Against protocol, ma'am.
I don't have a will.
Give her the damn pen and paper.
Who do you want me to give this to?
Tell you what.
I'll hold on to it.
Give it back to you when this is all over, okay?
You ready?
No.
She's already dead.
The only way she gets out of that building
is if they carry her out.
No.
Place is a fortress --
Metal detectors, cameras, U.S. Marshals.
It's not gonna be easy to get to her.
It wasn't easy to kill the OREA agents or the senator.
It doesn't have to be easy to get done.
Which is exactly what you're gonna tell the U.S. Attorney.
Save her life, maybe yours in the process.
Your whole plan, freeing the girl,
it all depends on me.
Me talking, telling the truth --
which, if I do, is a death sentence.
Makes me think I'm not getting enough out of the deal.
You agreed to talk.
Maybe I got cold feet.
Cold feet.
Take a look.
The woman I love is in there because of you.
So let's be clear. If you talk,
there is a chance they will kill you.
But if you don't talk,
I will definitely kill you very slowly.
You should also know that I know where your sister is.
Up in that hole where I found you.
I've killed a lot of people to get this done.
Don't think I won't do it again.
When I get the call, I'm walking you into that federal building
and you...will...talk.
That's it? That's your plan?
You want to abduct the Director of Clandestine Services?
Yes.
Okay, I, uh, really, really do not like that guy,
and I-I want to be a-a team player and all,
but this sounds a little like --
Treason? That's because it is.
Not to mention seditious conspiracy and felony kidnapping.
For which you could all spend the rest of your lives in prison.
What are you going to do? Ransom him back to the Cabal?
They won't exonerate Keen to get him back.
Agreed. That's why I have something in mind
that's infinitely more persuasive than ransom.
We've been monitoring the man around the clock.
He and his wife are in marital therapy.
I'm actually a great proponent of marital therapy.
Worked for me.
Then again, I had sort of a...thing for the therapist.
Lovely voice.
You were in therapy?
The Director's wife is a pill popper --
downers mainly, to deal with panic attacks and anxiety.
They see a psychiatrist every Wednesday morning,
Doctor Oren Huffnagel.
His wife meets him at the Middleton building.
A real creature of habit.
She gets a latte every day at the same shop,
and then, on Wednesdays, she walks over for the appointment.
The Director takes a scaled-down security team -- two agents,
one of whom stays in the lobby.
Sounds great, except tomorrow's not Wednesday.
Yes, which is why we'll need a ruse
that prompts the Director to go see the good doctor tomorrow.
And what do we do with him once we have him?
Your arraignment's tomorrow morning.
We got authorization to keep you here overnight.
Hey, don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.
Cooper reached out to Allison Gaines.
The criminal defense attorney?
One of the best in the country. She'll be here in the morning.
One more thing...
Yeah, it's me.
Are you all right?
I'm here.
Lizzy, you will make it through this.
Everything happens tomorrow.
Agent Ressler won't let you out of his sight.
Thank you.
I want her taken out tonight.
Calm down, Peter.
The problem of Elizabeth Keen
will be resolved by this time tomorrow.
Listen, we could have her commit suicide in her cell.
Agent Ressler's with her now,
and he won't leave her tonight.
We'll finish this tomorrow.
How?
We've been developing some new assets at the courthouse.
I've got someone in mind.
Who?
Agent Keen will never make it to Fort Meade.
I promise you that.
You promise me that? You do?
We're done, Peter.
You look tired.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep when this is over --
for both of us.
When's the lawyer coming?
Courthouse opens in half an hour.
Thank you.
♬Hey♬
♬Got to, got to payback♬
♬Payback♬
♬Revenge♬
♬Payback♬
♬Revenge♬
♬I'm mad♬
♬Payback is a thing you got to see♬
♬Hell♬
Wait. Uh, wait, we must be on the wrong floor.
I thought you said this is where the Director
and his wife get therapy.
It will be.
The routine is always the same.
The unhappy couple arrive separately
and are escorted into the lobby by two agents.
One agent remains downstairs watching the entrance,
the other escorts them onto an elevator
to ensure they ride alone in their misery.
Dr. Huffnagel is on the sixth floor,
suite 612, catty-corner to the elevators.
Yeah, I still don't get it.
If his office is on the sixth floor,
why are we on the eighth?
The layout of every floor in the building is identical.
All we need to do is recreate the sixth floor on the eighth.
♬Carry on♬
♬Carry on♬
Whoa, indeed.
I need you to access the elevator system
to make sure that when that agent presses 6,
the elevator takes them to 8, where we'll be waiting.
Oh, that is so cool. Sleight of hand.
I love magic.
♬Let me hit him, hit him, hit him♬
But, uh, the real trick is going to be getting the Director here
in the first place.
Harold Cooper and Agent Navabi
are working on that as we speak.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's all right. I'm fine.
Oh -- no, it's my fault. Let me get you another one.
No, really. It's all right.
Please, I insist.
All right, thank you.
Hi. I just bumped into this nice lady
and her coffee.
I'd like to buy her another one.
It was a latte.
Here you go. Again, I am so sorry.
It's okay. Thank you.
The figurine on the sixth floor,
the one under that mirror that's opposite the elevators.
We couldn't find a duplicate.
I can try to find something similar, but --
Good night. It's not the Hope Diamond.
Steal the damn thing.
And while I'm at it, shall I smile for the security cameras?
Apples.
Get a bowl. Something glass, crystal.
What if he notices? Dearie, this could blow the whole thing.
He won't.
She said, what if he does?
I know what she said, Marvin. Why are you still here?
Everybody likes apples.
Are you all right, ma'am?
I don't know what's happening.
I -- I'm dizzy.
Hang on. I got you.
We're gonna go right here.
Thank you, I -- I'm --
I can call 9-1-1.
No, my -- my heart, it's racing.
I can't get my breath.
I'm calling an ambulance.
No, no, I-I get panic attacks.
I -- I...
Oh, my God.
I'm...
You're okay.
My -- my doctor.
Huffnagel. It's in my contacts.
If you could -- please...
Yes, hello. Is Dr. Huffnagel in?
Yes, I'm -- I'm here with, uh...
Lynda. Lynda Kotsiopulos.
Lynda Kotsiopulos. She's, uh, dizzy.
Seems to be a panic attack of some sort.
Yes, she's right here.
Lynda? Is everything all right?
I think something's wrong.
I think I'm having another episode.
Have you taken your medication? - Yes, yes. Peter --
You have to call Peter.
Listen, you just -- you have to get ahold --
I'm calling Peter right now. You're gonna be fine.
Okay.
Could you help me get a cab, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
Elizabeth Keen. Allison Gaines.
Marshals will clear the floor and give you two some privacy.
Harold Cooper warned me.
He said you wouldn't look like much.
What does that mean?
It means my business is monsters, Agent Keen.
And I've met a lot of them.
All charged with a lot less than you are, sweetie.
You don't look like a monster.
Is this how you start all your client consultations?
I've read the complaint.
The U.S. government is formally charging you
with 16 counts of capital murder.
16?
14 C.I.A. agents killed in the OREA bombing,
the senator you infected -- Hawkins -- and, oh, yes,
the Attorney General of the United States.
There are other charges --
The off-duty cop you shot on the run.
I'm innocent. I'm being framed.
So the two witnesses
who saw you execute Tom Connolly were mistaken?
Listen to me. I won't lie to you.
I've been on this case 24 hours,
and what I see looks bad.
They're gonna kill me. Today.
Mr. Iverson, thank you for coming.
So, you're aware of what we're asking?
And you think you can get it done?
It won't happen in the pens.
I work courthouse security, but not in that area,
and you can't have weapons around the cells.
I can do it when they move her.
As long as it gets done.
This is assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Barrett.
When you're arrested, your case will go to him for prosecution.
I assume you recognize Judge Sanborn?
They can steer the case to me.
I'll order a psychiatric exam,
which will be done by one of our people.
With Mr. Barrett's consent, you'll be declared not guilty
by reason of insanity or mental defect.
You'll spend a couple of years
at a psychiatric facility of our choosing,
then be released.
You'll be a free man
with some very powerful and grateful friends.
If I don't make it, I want the money to go to my kids,
not my ex-wife.
Just get the job done.
Oyez oyez. All rise.
This court is now in session.
The honorable Judge Harrison Trotter presiding.
Calling United States vs. Elizabeth Keen.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Allison Gaines for the defendant.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Young for the government.
As you know, Your Honor,
this matter has national security implications.
You've seen the complaint.
So have I, Your Honor.
And in the interest of time, we waive any formal reading
of the rights and charges.
Denied.
Excuse me?
That may be the ordinary course of business,
but there is nothing ordinary about the charges
against your client.
Ms. Keen, the United States government has charged you
with 16 counts of capital murder.
Each one exposes you to a death sentence.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
That's aside from the treason and espionage charges,
which are also capital offenses.
Mr. Young, please read the names of the victims.
From the office of Russian and European Analysis --
Case officer Daniel Allen,
case officer Joanne Dobbs,
case officer Rebecca Haft,
case officer Marshall Masik.
I can only hope you smuggled me in here for an exclusive.
I need a favor.
I'm a reporter. I don't do favors.
There's gonna be a new development in the Keen case.
What development?
It's gonna break, and when it does,
I need you and your friends to be there.
So much for the exclusive.
Fine. But I get something in return.
Your story.
The story of the F.B.I. agent who hunted down his own partner.
Over dinner.
And a really expensive bottle of wine.
You and your pals show up, I'll take you to Teroni's.
I'll call you when we're ready.
She's in with the judge now. You ready?
Waiting on you.
Get Karakurt in position.
As soon as I hear from Reddington, we go.
You're on.
It's your moment of truth.
He looks worried.
Almost as if he got a call from his wife's shrink
telling him she's having a panic attack.
He's on his way to you now.
Aram, he's getting on elevator 22.
Okay.
Mr. Reddington, be advised...
Director arriving on the eighth floor in five,
four, three, two...
Baz.
He knows.
Give it a second.
Everybody likes apples.
Is my wife here?
Dr. H. is with your wife now.
I'll take you back.
Where's Dorothy today?
She's out. Her daughter is sick.
I'm Pamela.
Don't worry.
Lynda's fine.
He's not coming.
I'm sure he's coming, Lynda.
I'll try his office again.
Director's line.
Doctor Huffnagel here.
I'm sorry to call again,
but I'm here with Lynda,
and she's wondering if Peter is on his way.
What do you mean?
The Director got to your office two minutes ago.
No. He didn't. If he had --
He's under. Let's move.
I'm looking for the Director.
So are we. His wife is waiting --
Hey! You can't go in there.
Where is he? Where is Peter?
What's going on? Where the hell are you guys?
We're in the doctor's office. I'm in the waiting room.
No, you're not.
The Director's not here.
They took a freight elevator.
Okay. Te llamo.
Peter! Welcome back.
Boy, you were out!
Like carrying a bag of boulders.
What the hell have you done?
I envy anyone who can sleep soundly on a plane.
Then again, I've never been injected with propofol.
You have the Post Toasties?
Where the hell are we?
What is this? I'm -- I'm your hostage now?
Heavens, no. Nothing nearly so pedestrian.
The fact is, you're not my prisoner at all.
You're officially in the custody
of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
You must know Mr. Diaz,
Foreign Minister
And National Security Advisor to the Venezuelan President.
Mr. Kotsiopulos.
On behalf of my government,
you are hereby under arrest for war crimes
and crimes against humanity
in violation of the Geneva Convention
and International Law, as established
by the 1998 Rome Statute.
Oh, my God.
Oh, your God can't help you now, Peter.
You're traveling over the Atlantic,
on the Venezuelan President's airbus,
on your way to the Hague.
You're insane.
I wouldn't know.
But you're going to have the distinguished honor
of becoming the first American official ever
to be charged with even a single war crime,
let alone the slew of them
you will undoubtedly be accused of
before the week is out.
This won't happen.
United States isn't party to the Rome Treaty.
We don't recognize its authority.
But Venezuela does.
And cases can be referred to the court
by any country that is a signatory.
You know as well as I do, even better given your position,
the international court has been investigating
the U.S. government and the C.I.A.
for any number of alleged crimes.
The drone program,
the rendition of foreign citizens,
torture as a means of interrogation.
The chief prosecutor has made it clear.
He does not need American permission to move forward.
He needs an American in the flesh.
The court will not try anyone in absentia.
So far, no country has had the courage to deliver
one of your countrymen to the court until now.
You're a trendsetter, Peter. Who knew?
I am the C.I.A. Director of Clandestine Services.
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to you?
This is an act of war.
My government will never let it stand.
Precisely what I'm counting on.
Laurel Hitchin's office.
Good afternoon.
Raymond reddington calling for Laurel.
Peter, please, do sit.
That's the judge Reven Wright selected?
The personal friend she said we could trust?
She said he would be fair, not go easy on you.
He approved you going to Fort Meade,
which he didn't have to do.
And he agreed to keep Ressler as your transport.
Those are both wins.
About time we introduce our Russian friend to the world.
He did it? They got the Director?
I'll be back soon.
Be right downstairs, though, if you need anything.
Come on. Come on, come on.
Look over here. Over here. Is he under arrest?
Who is this? Does this have to do with Agent Keen?
I'll tell your sister you say hello.
Is he under arrest? Who is it? Come on.
Tell us who it is!
All right, I'll make a statement, a brief statement.
An alleged Cabal operative, known only as Karakurt,
has been taken into custody.
In connection with the OREA bombing
and the murder of Senator Hawkins.
What does that mean? Is he an accomplice?
Or are you saying Elizabeth Keen is innocent?
The F.B.I. now believes that Elizabeth Keen,
Agent Elizabeth Keen, was not responsible for those crimes.
What about the Attorney General?
I can't answer that at this time,
but I will say this arrest has yielded new evidence,
and our investigation into this so-called Cabal continues.
That'll be all for now.
I need to hear Peter's voice to confirm that he's alive.
I am here, Laurel.
I was abducted.
I appear to be on a Veneruelan jet somewhere over the Atlantic.
Mr. Diaz, do you have any concept of the wrath
you are bringing down on the government
and people of your country?
Threats.
This is how the U.S. responds to conflict.
Including a legitimate claim
that your government's actions have violated international law.
Laurel, Raymond here.
Here's where we stand.
In a handful of hours, this jet will land in Rotterdam,
it will be met by the Dutch federal police,
who will escort the Director to 's-Gravenhage,
where the global spectacle of a high-ranking American official
charged with war crimes will begin.
The sound of acquiescence.
What do you want?
What I've wanted since the beginning --
for you to exonerate Elizabeth Keen.
No.
Fine. But after you hang up with me,
your next call had better be to your President.
tell him you refused to prevent your country
from being humiliated, implicated,
and probably convicted.
This is quite a can of worms, Laurel.
If you have any doubts about that, turn on your television.
...alleged Cabal operative known only as Karakurt
has been taken into custdy
in connection with the OREA bombing...
What? This is supposed to scare me?
Quite the opposite.
Now you may be concerned that exonerating Agent Keen
will make you and your government look,
well, foolish,
but I'm handing you the solution.
Yes, you got it wrong, but thank heavens
you finally found the real culprit.
Of course, my offer will get considerably less generous
if anything should happen to Elizabeth Keen.
You'll call me back.
All set, Liz.
The transport team is ready. Time to go.
How's the Russian?
A little tense.
Thank you.
Be careful, both of you.
We're travelling.
Pick up the phone, damn it.
What the hell do you want?
Stop the transport. It's not safe.
Keep her in the cell. The corridors are not safe.
What? What are you -- what are you talking about?
The corridors are not safe.
Gun!
Okay, your girl just got a temporary reprieve.
Now, hy--
hypothetically, if we agree to your terms,
what kind of deal are you looking for?
My attorney will explain everything.
His name is Marvin Gerard.
Gerard? The fugitive?
The man you broke out of federal prison?
The same.
Damn it, Diane!
I told you. I'm not to be disturbed.
Sorry, Ms. Hitchin,
but there's a Marvin Gerard here to see you?
He says you're expecting him.
I'm sealing off the entire floor.
We're not going anywhere with these marshals.
We sit tight until Reddington gets in touch with us.
What the hell happened out there?
I don't know.
I got a call from Laurel Hitchin warning me that it wasn't safe.
It was her hit. Why would she call it off?
I don't know.
It's Reddington. He must be negotiating a deal.
Liz, it's working.
Laurel, I will not allow you to do this.
We can fight the Hague.
The administration will never let --
No, the administration won't fight this, Peter,
because they're not gonna ever hear about it, you understand?
None of this ever happened.
Raymond, I'm reviewing the deal they presented.
And for the most part, it's what you asked for.
With one glaring exception.
Keen will be exonerated for the OREA attack
and the Hawkins murder.
But they are insisting on a plea of guilty
for the killing of Tom Connolly.
That doesn't work, Laurel.
It's the best we can do.
I just spoke with the acting A.G.
She shot Connolly in front of witnesses.
He was orchestrating a conspiracy to frame Agent Keen
and implicate her colleagues.
She killed him, and not in self-defense.
And Tom Connolly was well-liked.
Look, I had to sell this deal.
It's not gonna get any better.
It's involuntary manslaughter. No jail time. That's the offer.
Then this plane will land.
We've bent as far as we can go.
If you pass on the this deal,
then we'll just take our chances at the Hague.
Pick up the phone, Marvin.
Can you excuse me?
Marvin?
It's a good deal, Red.
Bottom line, it keeps her safe and out of prison.
And frankly...
it's much better than I thought you'd ever get.
Get it done.
Hand the phone to Laurel.
Ms. Hitchin.
Yeah?
Okay, Laurel, we have a deal.
Once you've made a public announcement,
I'll drop the Director somewhere safe.
Mmm, no. Uh, just a sec.
Look, um...
Peter's become a-a liability.
If, uh, if we take care of this problem for you,
we would ask that you take care of that problem for us.
I expected as much.
So we're done?
Not quite.
There's one more thing, and it's not negotiable.
This is official?
They're willing to say I'm innocent?
Publicly,
of every charge against you except the Connolly shooting.
For that, you'd enter a plea of guilty
to involuntary manslaughter.
With three years of probation?
I've never seen anything like it.
But I'd be pleading guilty to a homicide.
They're taking away my badge.
If I sign this, I'll never be an agent again.
No. But the task force would continue.
Cooper would be cleared, put back in charge,
and you keep working with Reddington
to assist the government as an asset we employ,
not as an active agent.
Here.
This is for you.
Lizzy. Have you seen the deal?
Yes.
It's not everything we wanted,
but it's close.
You'll be safe. You'll be free.
But I won't be an agent.
I'll be an asset like you.
Yes.
I told you some time ago, when you pulled that trigger,
you crossed a threshold.
You stepped from your world into mine.
I wish I could deliver the perfect outcome,
but I'm afraid...
This is...
... fair.
Fairness is overrated.
And maybe there's a way to get you all the way back.
But for now, Lizzy, for today,
sign the deal.
Got a pen?
The United States government has confirmed
that the alleged criminal conspiracy known as "The Cabal"
is real.
This conspiracy has as its goal
one key objective -- to inflame tensions with Russia
and return the world to a Cold War posture.
In an effort to accomplish this,
members of the conspiracy framed
F.B.I. agent Elizabeth Keen,
making it appear as if she were a Russian sleeper agent.
These crimes were actually committed by an assassin
known only by his code name, Karakurt.
And I am proud to announce that due to outstanding work
by some of this country's best and brightest,
led by Special Agent Donald Ressler --
Karakurt is now in federal custody.
What about the Attorney General?
It saddens me greatly to say this,
but the evidence overwhelmingly shows
that Tom Connolly, the former Attorney General,
was a key member of this Cabal.
And while Ms. Keen did fire the shot that killed him,
earlier today a judge accepted her plea
to the charge of involuntary manslaughter,
approved by us, along with mandatory probation.
And Tom Connolly wasn't alone.
We have to now face the hard truth:
there are enemies of amea within our own ranks.
In fact, just a short time ago,
I learned that the Director of the Clandestine Service
of the C.I.A., Mr. Peter Kotsiopulos,
is also part of this conspiracy
and has apparently fled the country.
Hello, Peter.
Okay, that's my statement.
But on a personal note -- please.
I just wanna say,
when I think of the horrifying nightmare
that Elizabeth Keen has endured --
branded a traitor, hunted as a fugitive
by the very law enforcement agency
she swore an oath to serve...
Well, there are no words.
There is no apology I can give on behalf of the government
that could ever be sufficient.
I only hope that she can take some solace
in the knowledge that in the end,
the system worked.
Thank you.
I know who you really are, Raymond.
Who you are to her.
And I know why you did this.
Does she?
I can't think of even one set of circumstances
in which that would be any of your business.
We've been descending for some time now.
Looks like we'll be able to drop you off in time for dinner.

♬You're broken down and tired♬
♬Of living life♬
Keen.
♬On a merry-go-round♬
Paperwork's all ready.
♬And you can't find the fighter♬
Let's go.
♬But I see it in you so we gonna walk it out♬
Government has now said that
♬And move♬
Keen was framed for neary all of her alleged crime.
At a packed news conference, U.S...
♬Mountains♬
One jacket, one pair of leather boots,
one Montana State driver's license,
Samantha Evers.
And... $26 cash.
Oh, and Agent Ressler left you something.
♬And I'll rise up♬
♬High like the waves♬
I won't be needing this.
♬I'll rise up in spite of the ache♬
♬I rise up♬
You're sure about this?
I haven't been sure about much lately,
but, yeah, this one I know.
I'm a field agent. I kick down doors.
I'll leave all the politics and bureaucracy to the pros.
I'm proud of you, Agent Ressler.
You're the agent I always aspire to be.
Welcome back, sir.
You know what gets me?
Laurel Hitchin just walks away unscathed.
That's a fight for another day.
♬Feels like it's getting hard to breathe♬
♬And I know you feel like dying♬
I don't know why you want this.
The organization's in disarray.
Weaker than it's ever been.
It occurred to me that maybe
this was always part of your endgame --
to tear us down
so you could build us up and have a seat at the table.
♬Move♬
♬I'll rise up♬
♬Rise like the day♬
♬I'll rise up♬
♬In spite of the ache♬
♬I will rise♬
♬A thousand times again♬
♬And we'll rise up♬
♬High like the waves♬
♬We'll rise up♬
♬In spite of the ache♬
♬We'll rise up♬
♬And we'll do it a thousand times again♬
♬For you♬
♬You, ooh, ooh, ooh♬
♬You♬
♬You, ooh, ooh, ooh♬
