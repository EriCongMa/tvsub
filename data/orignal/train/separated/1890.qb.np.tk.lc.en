&quot; the end is the beginning is the end &quot;
it &apos;s a big day .
yeah . i &apos;m excited about it .
really ?
you finally gonna tell cristina that you &apos;re pregnant ?
what are you talking about ?
today is the last day of your first trimester .
i &apos;m talking about the plane crash .
the judge could have a decision today
about whether the hospital is at fault or not .
well , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
the lawyers moved for summary judgment .
well , that is a formality . then it &apos;s gonna go to trial .
it &apos;s gonna take months for a decision .
maybe not .
meredith , your first trimester is over .
let &apos;s focus on that .
try and relax a little bit . enjoy it .
tell your twisted sister . she &apos;ll be happy for you .
the big day is here--
the day you &apos;re gonna hear the news ,
the test result .
is the biopsy malignant or benign ?
am i gonna live or die ?
you just want to know .
breakfast for two ?
even if the news is scary .
ah , god . oh , my god . uh ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . i thought you were cristina , and you &apos;re not .
definitely not .
because then you can move on ,
whatever that means .
you didn &apos;t ?
yeah . i did .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not funny .
oh , i know . i know .
god .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s hilarious .
it was humiliating .
if you wear pants , it doesn &apos;t happen as much .
i just got up .
i was looking for a glass for water &apos; cause i &apos;m hung over .
and why are there no glasses or--or mugs or anything ?
you &apos;re pretty loud for a hung @-@ over girl .
the chief of surgery just felt me up .
and i had to sleep on your living room floor
because you have no furniture ,
and now i have a neck ache .
being your friend is basically ruining my life .
i &apos;ve heard that before .
you &apos;re a douche .
get a couch , or i &apos;m never drinking with you again .
look , if you &apos;re thirsty , all you gotta do
is stick your face under the faucet .
oh , okay .
i &apos;m going to the hospital
where there &apos;s food and paper cups .
sir . from my mom .
cookies .
oh , you know , that &apos;s not necess--
oh , and there &apos;s a message
that i am supposed to read to you , make sure you get it .
&quot; richard , i am in town doing a case at seattle pres .
&quot; left you several messages and wasn &apos;t sure you got them .
&quot; i just want to make sure you &apos;re okay .
&quot; i &apos;m worried about you ,
baby . &quot;
uh , to be clear , that was her and not me .
well , please tell her i &apos;m fine .
oh , no , you gotta take the cookies , sir .
that &apos;s such a nice gesture ,
but i &apos;m trying to avoid sweets .
uh , would you like them ?
um , i can put them in the lounge ,
and everybody can enjoy them .
oh , that &apos;s a fine idea .
morning .
hey , i heard there might be a judgment today .
i hope it works out for you .
no , you don &apos;t .
a judgment comes down that quickly ,
it means the hospital &apos;s negligent .
it means you did something wrong .
which you did .
well , you &apos;ve obviously been thinking that for a while .
i &apos;m glad you ...
finally got it out in the open .
and for the record ,
i really do hope it works out for you .
i heard your girlfriend did a little panty dance
in the kitchen this morning .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
look , i know it &apos;s weird .
she &apos;s hot and she &apos;s always around ,
but i don &apos;t even think of her like that .
it &apos;d be like you and i sleeping together .
ew . i &apos;m trying to eat my breakfast .
did you hear your husband accidentally copped a feel ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
oh , and he &apos;s not my husband .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s sneaking in at the crack of crack .
you are a messed up broad .
dr. webber rejected my mother &apos;s cookies .
that sounds dirty .
she &apos;s worried about him .
she wants me to assess his mood . she thinks he &apos;s depressed .
well , his wife died a month ago .
isn &apos;t he supposed to be depressed ?
of course , but , like , normal depressed
or too depressed ?
i mean , he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s back at work .
nah , but he &apos;s not operating .
maybe you should hold him .
and i &apos;m done .
enjoy the cookies .
thanks .
so what do you mean , he touched your boobs ?
like &quot; wah @-@ wah &quot; ?
he &apos;s not a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . he &apos;s the chief of surgery .
well , i &apos;m sorry that i don &apos;t know
how the chief of surgery touches boobs ...
but was it , like , a glancing thing ,
like--like side boob ?
heather .
show me what happened .
no .
was it--look .
was it like this ?
no , it was like a move up the front .
yes .
ahem . murphy , let &apos;s go .
we got a facial reconstruction .
i gotta go , too .
i &apos;m working with dr. shepherd .
i think he &apos;s back for real today--
operating .
i think we &apos;re all happy about that .
i &apos;ve got post @-@ ops with yang .
i &apos;m on grey . with grey .
&quot; on grey &quot; sounds--
dr. avery , i &apos;m just on scut .
if you don &apos;t mind , can i tag along ?
i don &apos;t know . um ... sure , i guess . come on .
quick question about the case .
that ...
was good .
you like that , throwing murphy on my service ?
and made me beg to tag along .
now you understand that it &apos;s in both of our interests
to keep this thing quiet , right ?
relax . do you really think i want anyone to think
i &apos;m getting surgeries because i &apos;m sleeping with my boss ?
i want to get them because of my awesomeness .
well , that &apos;s true ,
because you are extremely awesome .
and that is how ...
they invented the shunt .
that is fascinating .
so i think our big mistake last time was ,
we tried to get you back too fast .
so this time , baby steps .
torres--
who &apos;s the patient ?
i &apos;m the patient .
that &apos;s right . now ...
this is the same muscle movement
you use with leskell rongeur .
basically , the same motion as hitting a ping @-@ pong ball .
so that is what you &apos;re gonna do today .
for how long ?
uh , how long did your last meningioma removal take ?
it was eight hours , i think .
we &apos;re gonna play ping @-@ pong for eight hours ?
not me . i &apos;ve got surgery .
well , then who ?
morning . we back in the saddle ?
what ?
you &apos;re gonna love this one .
what , m.v.c. , g.s.w. ?
better . stripper pole .
vitals stable in the field .
has abdominal tenderness from a crush injury .
she slipped . make sure she &apos;s all right .
off a pole ?
i @-@ it was our anniversary .
they installed it right in the bedroom .
i wanted it to be a surprise .
it was .
i thought i was getting an ipad .
hey . where &apos;d you get the cookies ?
webber didn &apos;t want the pity cookies
from his girlfriend about his dead wife .
he &apos;s not operating ,
so jackson &apos;s &quot; mommy &quot; was worried .
whatever . these cookies are awesome .
what about jackson ?
are you still pining over jackson ?
no . god . no .
why ? is he seeing someone ?
april , april ...
jackson is like a cookie .
people want to lose weight , they don &apos;t eat the cookie .
but then they get so hung up
on not having the cookie
that their whole life is about the cookie .
my whole life is not about the cookie .
is your whole life about the cookie ?
what do you mean ?
you and owen , are you guys a thing again or ...
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is ,
having sex with a man who used to be your husband
is way more fun than when he is your husband .
that &apos;s all you know ?
that is all i know .
unless there &apos;s something else you ... want to tell me ?
no . nothing i can think of .
okay , then .
okay .
hey , cristina .
ahh . whoa . nice shot , dr. shepherd .
you put a little something on that backhand ?
7 serving 2 .
hey , derek . answer your phone .
we &apos;re in the middle of a game .
well , you know what ? not anymore .
the lawyer called ,
and they need us at the courthouse . now .
did i miss it ?
damn it . i &apos;m sorry .
i got out of the o.r. as fast as i could ,
but i didn &apos;t think it was gonna happen today .
oh , god .
was it bad ?
it wasn &apos;t ?
we won .
he said the airline company
had a history of mechanical problems with the plane .
it was in public record ,
and the hospital should &apos;ve known .
he found the hospital negligent .
so we won .
when &apos;s he gonna tell us about the award ?
i mean ... i hate to be all about the money--
he already did .
he &apos;s giving us $ 15 million .
whoa .
each .
第九季 第十一集
so what happens now ,
the hospital hands us a check for $ 15 million ?
oh , well , their insurance company does ,
and it &apos;ll probably take some time to get through
all the bureaucratic rigmarole , but , yeah .
pending appeal ,
the insurance company
will issue each of you a big check .
in the meantime , i have a ping @-@ pong ball to hit .
yeah , i gotta get back , too .
i have james leggett &apos;s surgery .
oh , how is james ?
well , that &apos;s right .
you and--and mark did his original cranial expansion .
wait . wait . wait . wait . wait . why is everyone rushing off ?
this is a momentous event .
shouldn &apos;t we do something , like celebrate or ...
okay , maybe &quot; celebrate &quot; &apos; s too strong a word .
dinner .
we should have a dinner . come on .
we &apos;ve been sitting in rooms with each other for months
talking about this , and we just won .
what &apos;s wrong with sitting in one more room
with--with food in front of us ?
i &apos;m gonna do a quick exam .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i was doing a sexy flexy ,
next thing i know , i was on the floor .
a sexy flexy ?
it &apos;s a move .
i could do it perfectly in class .
uh , uh , you have a bruise near your tailbone .
you must have landed on a hard surface .
i landed on my husband .
and there was nothing hard about him .
leonard olsen , 67 , came in via e.m.s.
his wife was on a stripper pole and fell on him
while trying to execute a move called a sexy flexy .
his physical exam indicates possible internal injuries .
so why don &apos;t you get mr. olsen &apos;s past medical history
while i order a scan ?
see that ?
your face ?
now imagine how i felt .
we could buy a house .
we have a house .
we could buy another house .
we could buy five houses .
we could buy five houses
with yards as big as football fields .
we could buy the team to play on the football field .
who would play against them ?
well , we &apos;d buy another team .
i just wanted a house .
mo &apos; money , mo &apos; problems .
i should &apos;ve been on that damn plane .
james was born with crouzon syndrome ,
a genetic disorder characterized
by the premature fusion of certain skull bones ,
resulting in--
a weird @-@ looking face .
james .
fine .
a tall narrow head , wide @-@ set eyes ,
and a small midface .
now over the years , dr. sloan has operated on james ...
five separate times to--
try and make me less weird looking .
james .
what ? even sloan said i was weird looking ,
and you worshipped him .
my mom thought sloan walked on water . no pressure .
dr. sloan was great with him .
i really can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
i know , and i know that this isn &apos;t easy ,
trusting the new guy .
you were sloan &apos;s guy . that &apos;s all we need to know .
the only person who liked sloan more than my mom was my dad .
again ...
no pressure . i got it . okay .
i know that dr. sloan &apos;s plan called for this final operation
to consist of simply moving the upper jaw forward .
i am recommending a monobloc advancement ,
which means , dr. edwards ?
cutting into your skull and moving the whole midface ...
forward in one block .
excellent job , dr. edwards .
thank you , dr. avery .
uh ... if this is a better procedure ,
why didn &apos;t sloan suggest it ?
for one thing , dr. sloan did not anticipate
that james &apos; forehead would still be
this disproportionately underdeveloped .
hey , everybody . sorry i &apos;m late .
what &apos;s up ?
dr. avery was just explaining the new plan .
mark had a plan .
and i have a different plan ,
which gives james a more normal appearance .
but mark knew james for 16 years .
you &apos;ve known him for , like , uh , 16 minutes .
you know what ? if mark was here ,
then i would be glad to have this argument with him .
he was a plastic surgeon .
this not your area of expertise .
so if you want me to walk you through my thought process ,
i guess i can do that as a courtesy .
what i &apos;m not gonna do is stand here and argue with you
about this procedure .
this is what i &apos;m doing .
you &apos;ll walk me through your thought process
as a courtesy ?
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;ll wait .
all right .
i &apos;m just not ready for callie &apos;s dinner tonight .
it &apos;s too weird .
i know . how long do you think
till these parasites are hitting us up for a lung ?
dr. grey .
that was fast .
glad you &apos;re back . i have a patient .
she &apos;s a 19 @-@ year @-@ old college kid ,
nauseated with a distended stomach .
and she says there &apos;s no way that she &apos;s pregnant .
oh , everybody always says that ,
and then they always end up pregnant .
okay , but if the pregnancy test is negative ?
okay , i will come with you .
but i am not taking point , you are .
yeah , you know , that really is a problem ,
people claiming not to be pregnant
when they really are .
you know ?
of course i know .
her boobs got huge about two weeks ago ,
and she &apos;s eating everything in sight .
but she didn &apos;t tell you ?
no , but ... she knows i know .
so you know she knows that you know ?
she &apos;ll tell me when she &apos;s ready to be happy about it .
congratulations .
taylor ?
you &apos;re not pregnant .
of course she &apos;s not pregnant .
taylor knows better than to bring boys home .
she knows she needs to focus on her studies .
get your hair out of your mouth .
taylor , do you mind if i take a look at your stomach ?
of course you can take a look . you &apos;re the doctor .
does that hurt ?
have you been constipated ?
i don &apos;t know .
speak up . no one can hear you when you &apos;re mumbling .
yes .
yes , what ? yes , you &apos;re constipated ?
the doctors aren &apos;t mind readers .
okay , she &apos;s not constipated .
okay .
she &apos;s just throwing up .
mrs. lanz , do you mind if we step outside
while the doctor examines taylor ?
taylor doesn &apos;t mind if i stay . do you ?
oh , it &apos;ll just take a second .
that was awesome .
so ...
you need to talk to the patient , not the mother .
if the mother interrupts you , you stop her .
so let &apos;s start again .
robbins is concerned .
yeah , well , she shouldn &apos;t be . i &apos;ve thought this through .
i &apos;ve got a solid plan .
so did sloan .
i did james &apos; first surgery with mark
when we still lived in new york .
yeah , i know . i &apos;ve read through sloan &apos;s notes .
how old is james now ?
he &apos;s 16 .
when you &apos;re 16,
you &apos;re worried about your s.a.t. score , your future .
yeah , well , so am i.
this is gonna improve his appearance by 5 % to 10 % .
but at what cost ? it &apos;s riskier .
it &apos;s complicated recovery time .
i would stick with soan &apos;s plan .
i got a message about a consult .
oh , yeah . chest x @-@ ray came back .
turned out to be heartburn .
oh , god . there &apos;s ...
why is she coming over here ?
she &apos;s on my service . relax .
dr. yang ,
i did orthostatics
on 21 @-@ 14 .
hey , you know , uh ,
you know , your hair and hers ...
oh . you know , from behind kind of--
yeah , no . totally honest mistake .
yeah .
okay , these results are weird .
schedule a tilt table test .
i said &quot; relax , &quot; not make it worse .
grabby .
what ?
are you trying to see if it &apos;s really me or some intern ?
i &apos;m ... relieved .
i heard about the judgment .
yeah ?
it hasn &apos;t really sunk in yet .
hey , will you come to this thing with me tonight ?
uh , depends . what &apos;s the thing ?
oh , it &apos;s dumb .
callie wants to have a survivors dinner .
it sounds morbid to me , actually .
but if you come , it could be fun .
i mean , i could get drunk and dance on a table .
promise .
that &apos;s ... i ...
shepherd doesn &apos;t want me there .
why ?
he blames me . and--and i get it .
i &apos;m the bad guy .
and i don &apos;t know if i want to be forgiven .
don &apos;t play martyr .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m-- this is--
i am partially responsible .
so if shepherd doesn &apos;t want me around--
okay , you know what i think ?
i think derek shepherd--
let &apos;s just leave the case and the crash
in the past outside ,
and just be here right now .
just you and me .
okay .
so now what ?
now ...
you take your shirt off .
okay .
you can take off your pants .
faster !
bailey said i would find you here .
what is this place ?
well , it &apos;s my hall of horrors .
at least that &apos;s what adele used to call it .
malignant teratoma resected from a liver in 1985 .
this thing is 27 years old ?
it was the first in my collection .
i &apos;m cataloging it ,
and then medical waste is gonna come
and take it all away .
i remember this guy .
this is the guy who swallowed all the pennies .
this was my intern year .
that &apos;s ron newsome .
he swallowed these scissors a year later .
and why do you want to get rid of all this stuff ?
what do you want , grey ?
i came to ask you if you would like to scrub in on a surgery .
a very cool case , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old girl
with an unknown mass in her abdomen .
i &apos;m busy .
richard , i &apos;m worried .
no need to worry .
i &apos;ve heard you haven &apos;t been operating .
i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t need your help .
i need to be left alone .
so please let me do what i &apos;m doing .
okay .
you called shepherd on me ?
he &apos;s not on james &apos; case anymore .
he &apos;s a trusted colleague and a respected surgeon ,
and i-- and i &apos;m a plastic surgeon .
hey , uh , quick question about the sitter for tonight .
uh , yeah . hold on for one second .
well-- i don &apos;t know about the dinner .
it just-- it feels weird .
we &apos;re doing the dinner , okay ?
um , curly hair can &apos;t sit .
so i was gonna ...
so i was gonna call art student ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s fun and sofia loves her ,
but unibrow cleans . what do you think ?
i think that you should learn their names ,
and you should call claudia
because kelli has only sat for us once ,
and i don &apos;t want sofia with someone new .
great . um , claudia is ...
okay--
unibrow .
right .
yeah . this is why i went to derek , okay ?
mark knew james . he was with him from the beginning .
and you &apos;re just the new babysitter
who doesn &apos;t know where we keep the extra wipes at .
i waited around here for you to insult me again ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s been a weird morning .
and--but mark was so invested and so--
i was coming to tell you that i changed my mind .
i &apos;m now doing the procedure sloan &apos;s way .
oh , great . thanks .
sorry .
your husband &apos;s scans show that a rib
punctured his diaphragm
when you ... landed on him .
we &apos;re gonna need to operate ,
but i &apos;m confident we can fix the problem .
oh , thank god . i feel so terrible .
here you go , sheila .
this will make your ride to radiology more comfortable .
now about that x @-@ ray ...
is it okay if i have metal on my ... cookie ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
you ... bedazzled your vagina ?
it &apos;s called vajazzling .
all the stars are doing it .
oh , it &apos;s a butterfly . look .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s the body and those--those are the wings .
that &apos;s game .
you win again , dr. shepherd .
wait .
just stop .
great . this was fun .
i think you &apos;re letting me win .
you &apos;re a smart man .
i am .
so am i.
that &apos;s why i &apos;m absolutely letting you win .
whupping your ass wouldn &apos;t be a smart move ,
especially since you &apos;re a competitive guy who likes to win .
do you know who else is a competitive guy , ross ?
a neurosurgeon .
i thought you had what it takes to be one .
mm . see ? i am a smart man ,
and you are now goading me .
but you won &apos;t like it when you lose .
oh , &quot; when &quot; i lose ?
you &apos;ll be angry and never want to see my face .
that won &apos;t help me on my quest to become you .
yeah , i &apos;ve told you , it &apos;s creepy when you say that .
sorry . it is what it is .
i need a real test , ross , okay ?
dr. ramsey has a chiari decompression tomorrow ,
and i &apos;m sure she needs someone to help assist .
if you beat me in this game , i will put in a ...
1 @-@ love .
is that for me ? thanks .
catherine , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m taking you to lunch .
we have reservations at the firefly .
i don &apos;t have surgery until later on ,
and i couldn &apos;t just sit in my hotel
knowing that you &apos;re 5 miles away ,
and i haven &apos;t laid eyes on you .
well , i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve been busy .
i haven &apos;t had time to check ...
richard , jackson told me you &apos;re not operating .
i &apos;m worried about you .
you look thin .
are you eating ? are you sleeping ?
look , you &apos;re not my wife .
so you don &apos;t get to ...
my wife died .
while i was carrying on with another woman ,
my wife died , catherine .
so what i &apos;m eating
and how i &apos;m sleeping is not your concern .
i haven &apos;t returned your calls
because i don &apos;t want to go to lunch .
i don &apos;t want cookies . i don &apos;t want you here .
if you &apos;ll excuse me now , grey and i have a surgery .
so what &apos;s the plan for the house ?
i &apos;m sick of sitting on the floor .
nice !
shepherd scores .
ah , waiting out yang .
she &apos;s gonna break down and furnish the whole house .
what ? it &apos;s genius .
yes ! you got it , shepherd .
wilson , your friend &apos;s choking .
you want to make this interesting ?
100 bucks says shane wins .
you don &apos;t have 100 bucks .
i won &apos;t eat for a month .
hey . who &apos;s , uh , who &apos;s winning ?
he &apos;s got shane on the ropes .
please . shepherd &apos;s meat . watch shane &apos;s dead ball .
that &apos;s my wrist in there .
wilson , it &apos;s not too late to back down .
i &apos;m a gentleman . i &apos;ll let you walk away .
ah , damn it ! ah !
500 bucks .
okay , how about we take a break ?
let me take a look at that wrist .
the wrist isn &apos;t the problem . it &apos;s his feet .
they &apos;re not as fast as mine , &apos; cause he &apos;s an old man .
sorry , dr. shepherd . i don &apos;t know where that came from .
i occasionally get carried away while engaging in athletic--
okay . 9 @-@ 8 .
let &apos;s go , bitch .
okay , boys , i trust that you remember ,
this is not wimbledon ,
but a hospital conference room table
where you are working on strengthening your muscles
so that one day soon you can operate again .
also , respond to my e @-@ mail about the dinner tonight
and let everyone know you &apos;re very excited about it .
what if i &apos;m not ?
come on , derek . if you go , everyone will .
play is continuous .
what dinner ?
they won the crash case . $ 15 mil each .
hey , dr. yang , congratulations on winning the case .
are you gonna spend some of that money
on furniture for the house ?
why ? it &apos;s not my house .
yeah . you &apos;re a genius .
my turn .
you need to forgive owen .
for what ?
you &apos;re holding a grudge .
you make it sound like
he stole my lunch from the refrigerator .
derek , we won .
we get to move on .
and we have to let owen do the same .
he put us on that plane .
you know what ? you were chief once .
you make a bunch of decisions
based on what you know at the time .
forgive him .
it &apos;s not that easy .
i know .
forgive him anyway .
let &apos;s go .
wilson , you &apos;re working not playing ping @-@ pong .
500 bucks . let me know how it goes .
you are gonna do great .
i &apos;ll come back tomorrow after volleyball practice .
i know .
my girlfriend &apos;s hot .
you &apos;re wondering how i do it .
no . no .
yeah .
sloan ... telling me i was weird looking .
he wasn &apos;t being a jerk .
it was just that surgery was only gonna take me so far .
i was never gonna look completely normal , so ...
i was gonna have to develop some moves to get the women .
so he gave you a couple of tips .
getting women was kind of his specialty .
nah . sloan said his moves would never work for me .
i had to come up with my own .
so i blind them with my amazing personality .
they don &apos;t even notice the weird @-@ looking face .
well , it looks like it &apos;s working .
i do all right .
although not being weird looking would be cool , too .
again , no pressure .
let &apos;s see what we can do about that .
whatever happened to just regular old sex ,
without poles or vaginas dressed up in rhinestone ?
when did just plain old &quot; get naked &quot; become boring ?
antibiotic lavage .
and i suppose men do it , too , bedazzle their penis ?
i &apos;m really trying not to think about it .
somebody look that up .
on it .
just foolish .
idiotic .
kepner , you ever vajazzled yourself ?
oh , right . jesus isn &apos;t a fan of the vajazzle .
boki ?
feel good being back in the o.r. ?
grey ... let &apos;s focus on the patient .
opening the stomach . babcock clamp .
here you go .
lap pads .
whoa .
look at that thing .
well , would you look at that . a bezoar .
it &apos;s a giant hairball .
like from eating your hair ?
like from eating your hair .
i used to eat dirt .
i haven &apos;t in years .
mm . you got here just in time to lose .
final point , advantage ross .
ah , shepherd &apos;s got this .
double or nothing .
what &apos;s the matter , you scared ?
fine . you &apos;re on . 1,000 bucks .
whoo ! shane !
come on , shepherd !
whoo ! you got it !
ah , yes !
damn it .
yes ! oh , yeah .
yes . one more game .
no way . i won it .
i get to assist on ramsey &apos;s surgery .
get on that phone right now and you call her ,
or i swear to god , i &apos;ll ...
sir , again , i don &apos;t know what came over me .
what i meant to say is ,
i &apos;d appreciate the opportunity .
yeah . fine . one more game .
this time , i play with my dominate hand .
oh , yeah . it feels so good . $ 1,000 .
i &apos;ll get it to you later . i gotta go to the cash machine .
oh , i &apos;m headed that way myself .
i &apos;ll come with you . uh @-@ huh .
it &apos;s too cool to let it go to medical waste .
how are you gonna throw all this stuff away ?
you know what i see
when i look at the scissors ron newsome swallowed ?
i see the thanksgiving that i didn &apos;t take off .
so i didn &apos;t join adele in london .
the teratoma kept me from our anniversary party .
black tie .
she planned the whole thing .
i got there in time for dessert .
all this stuff that i saved ,
that i &apos;m so proud of ...
just reminds me of my failures .
so ...
you must be happy about the judgment ?
what are you gonna do with all that money ?
oh , it &apos;s blood money . my sister &apos;s dead . it &apos;s ...
meredith ,
it &apos;s a good thing .
haven &apos;t you suffered enough ?
haven &apos;t you ?
well , it &apos;s just a bruised tailbone .
you can go home now .
and your husband shouldn &apos;t be too far behind ,
just maybe a couple of days .
thank you .
no driving for him , though , for at least a month .
and that goes for sexual activity , too .
uh , and ...
so stay off the pole .
you just got back from your honeymoon .
you come talk to me after 45 years of marriage
and raising three kids .
you get tired .
you just want to sit in front of the tv
and-- and say it &apos;s done , it &apos;s over .
but you know what ? i &apos;m not doing that .
i &apos;m trying . at least i &apos;m trying .
she &apos;s sorry . she didn &apos;t mean to judge .
and the worst part is ,
he looked embarrassed for me .
i mean , that hurts .
that hurts more than a bruised tailbone .
i mean , i survived 45 years of marriage .
is it so wrong for me to want to celebrate my anniversary
with a little sex ?
well , is it ?
no , it &apos;s not . no , no .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s a good idea .
it &apos;s not . i said no .
so i &apos;m gonna teach you two how to prefor a monobloc .
wait . what ? no , no , no .
you told me that you were reverting to mark &apos;s--
yes , but i &apos;m just not comfortable with that .
well , you can &apos;t just change your plan in surgery .
i didn &apos;t . i spoke with dana and phil
and dr. jovan , the plastics attending who &apos;s overseeing me .
dr. avery , mark had a very good reason for wanting to do
a simple jaw .
of course he did . but mark is not here anymore .
so i need to do what i think is best for my patient .
so ...
i &apos;m going to begin by shaving a short strip
along the coronal incision .
instead of cutting off all of his hair .
hey . maybe he can &apos;t get it up anymore .
maybe that &apos;s why he looked embarrassed .
or maybe , like the woman said ,
he was just embarrassed for her .
oh , come on . they &apos;re sweet .
you just got back from your honeymoon .
i &apos;d think you of all people would appreciate an older couple
with a healthy sex life .
no , i do appreciate a healthy sex life .
it &apos;s just ...
okay , look , i had sex once on my honeymoon--
one time , the very first night .
we arrived in the bahamas ,
and my husband wanted to have sex .
not in our well @-@ appointed suite , but on the beach .
so off to the beach we went ,
where we had sex ,
and i got sand up in my ... cookie .
yes , a vagina full of sand .
that gave me a bad , bad infection ,
requiring a trip to the local doctor ,
who confirmed the infection
and also diagnosed a few sand flea bites on my buttock .
yeah , his word . buttock .
he also went on to say that my buttock
would become very itchy , and he was right .
so a painful infection and an itchy buttock
are what i had on my honeymoon .
so , no , no , i am not a fan of the beach or the pole .
or anywhere at this point .
i am a fan of a bed .
oh , that &apos;s right .
go on , friend . laugh .
how &apos;s everyone &apos;s dinner ?
good .
good .
good .
good .
yeah . it &apos;s good .
good .
how &apos;d the surgery with james go ?
uh ... jackson didn &apos;t listen .
he went ahead with the monobloc readvancement .
really ?
how long did that take ?
five hours . yeah .
i stood there , you know ,
just to make sure he didn &apos;t mess it up .
ma &apos;am ?
uh , perfect .
okay , very good .
i &apos;d like to make a toast .
oh , callie , no toasts .
you know what ? let &apos;s just get this dinner over with--
arizona stood for five hours .
that &apos;s not the point .
yeah , i know . do you realize how big a deal it is ?
you standing for five hours isn &apos;t the point ?
do you know what else happened today ?
derek played ping @-@ pong .
and lost .
and wanted to keep on playing
&apos;cause his wrist wasn &apos;t sore .
what are you doing ?
oh , sorry . i &apos;m just , uh , quick texting owen .
sexting .
no , she &apos;s--she &apos;s trying is what she &apos;s doing .
yeah . you just divorced the guy , and here you are texting him .
mer &apos;s right . i &apos;m sexting .
oh , well , even better .
mark would &apos;ve loved that .
sex was the thing he loved more than anything else .
and we &apos;re all having it , so that &apos;s--
well , um
well , we &apos;re trying .
yeah , okay .
we &apos;re ...
don &apos;t you see that ? we &apos;re all trying .
we &apos;re trying to move on , which is progress .
and it feels weird ...
and sad and wrong , but it also feels exciting .
i miss mark ...
and lexie .
and i &apos;m ... heartbroken that they &apos;re not here tonight .
i &apos;m heartbroken , but ...
i &apos;m also grateful ...
that all of you are .
and i &apos;m gonna celebrate that .
and we are gonna toast .
come on . toast . pick up your glasses and toast .
oh , no , thank you .
yes , she &apos;s having champagne .
grey , we &apos;re all having champagne .
no , i can &apos;t .
just try . try . come on . just try .
is it too much to ask you to try ?
i can &apos;t because i &apos;m pregnant .
what ?
aww . wh @-@ wh @-@ what ?
and i &apos;m happy , so let &apos;s celebrate .
oh , my god .
oh , my goodness .
well , congratulations .
congratulations .
well , cheers .
cheers .
i should &apos;ve been there , catherine .
i know .
i failed her .
when she needed me the most , i failed her .
richard--
no , i ...
i feel like i can &apos;t grieve .
like i lost the right to grieve
when i started seeing you .
but you are grieving , baby .
and you shouldn &apos;t have to do it alone .
i would like to just hold your hand .
could you let me do that ?
could i just hold your hand ?
well , the good news is , the surgery went great .
the bad news is ,
you &apos;re just gonna be another pretty face from now on .
thank you so much .
yeah , well , dr. sloan did most of it .
i just took us into the end zone .
yeah .
you know jackson told me he thinks james
may not even need another major surgery ?
really ? jackson told you that ?
did jackson have his hands on your boobs when he said it ?
what are you talking about ?
you made fun of me for sleeping with karev .
called me a skank ,
made this &quot; i don &apos;t wanna be like leah &quot; thing ,
and now you &apos;re sleeping with the boss .
how &apos;d you know ?
oh , well , i didn &apos;t . now i do .
everything looks good .
so ... you &apos;re gonna have to learn how to stand up for yourself .
i know it &apos;s not gonna be easy , but ...
your mom makes me want to eat my hair .
i just found out it was hair .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s a condition called trichotillomania .
and it makes you want to pull out your hair
and in some cases , eat it .
so we &apos;re gonna set her up with a therapist
who &apos;s gonna help her to--
no . here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen--
she &apos;s just gonna stop ,
like i did when i stopped eating carbs .
you just decide and that &apos;s it .
this is not like you not eating carbs .
it &apos;s a medical condition , and ...
you &apos;re gonna take me to see a therapist .
i am ...
kind of sleeping with stephanie .
i was hoping that you wouldn &apos;t have to find out about it at all .
but of course , it &apos;s probably gonna get out .
so i just wanted to make sure
that you didn &apos;t have to hear about it from anyone else .
i miss you .
i just--i feel like we were friends ,
and now everything is just so--
so we can still be friends .
you know what i &apos;m thinking about right now ?
kissing you .
standing here looking at you ,
and all i want to do is kiss you .
so , no , i @-@ i--i &apos;m--
i &apos;m not ready to be your friend yet .
you sure ?
yes .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
thank you for telling me .
i just checked in on your wife .
medically , she &apos;s fine .
otherwise ...
your wife is horny , leonard .
all there is to it . she wants some sex .
she needs it .
is the equipment working , sir ?
yes .
good , good . then use it .
you &apos;re married .
if i were married , i would be doing it all day long .
just ...
do it .
slowly . slowly .
i got you a couch with the money i won .
this is such a girlfriend thing .
okay , i think what you want to say is ,
&quot; thank you for the awesome couch . &quot;
okay .
but we &apos;re not doing it , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
why would we do it ? that &apos;s disgusting .
you &apos;re like my brother .
we drink beer and hang out .
i &apos;ve never really had a friend who was a girl
who didn &apos;t want to do it so it &apos;s weird .
except mer , and she probably wanted me at some point .
wow . you really are a douche .
just shut up and drink .
hunt , come over here .
i @-@ i can &apos;t .
i--it &apos;s not your fault .
i know that . we &apos;re moving forward .
just please come over here and have a drink .
shepherd , i--
cristina .
tell your husband to come over here and have a drink .
no , no . he &apos;s not my husband .
i mean , i don &apos;t know what you are .
i mean , i don &apos;t know what we are , but ...
you know , it doesn &apos;t matter .
all that matters now is that i &apos;m drunk and happy ,
and i want you to be here ,
drunk and happy with me .
plus the bathroom &apos;s locked , so ...
whatever you &apos;re doing , just ... let somebody else do it
and come on over and have a drink .
they say ignorance is bliss .
another time .
enjoy your party .
because once you know about the tumor or the prognosis ,
you can &apos;t go back .
so where are we at ?
the insurance company found a loophole .
apparently there &apos;s a rule
that no more than two attendings are allowed on a medi plane .
so when dr. robbins
took dr. karev &apos;s place on the flight ...
anyway , they say they aren &apos;t gonna pay .
okay , so who pays ?
we do .
the hospital .
we don &apos;t have that kind of reserve .
no , we don &apos;t .
so ?
we go bankrupt .
the hospital closes its doors .
will you be strong
or will you fall apart ?
it &apos;s hard to predict .
so don &apos;t worry about it .
enjoy the time you have before the news comes .
