my mother &apos;s still alive .
victoria is the only person left who
could possibly tell me where she is .
mason treadwell .
i know who you are .
you wrote that book about david clarke .
thank you for ...
taking an interest .
my father told me ...
my mother died in an institution .
why would he make me believe she was dead
when she was obviously still alive ?
because he was trying to protect you .
amanda . damn it .
your mother tried to kill you .
that &apos;s a lie .
it is the absolute truth !
jack , it &apos;s amanda .
there &apos;s been an accident .
mommy &apos;s here .
come here .
it &apos;s okay .
they say let he who is without sin
cast the first stone .
amanda !
hang in there , amanda . daddy &apos;s here .
amanda !
and to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness .
come on , baby . hang in there .
amanda !
no !
don &apos;t touch her !
okay , come on . breathe .
breathe , amanda .
but when your memories are freshly opened wounds ,
forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions .
you okay ?
i know why my father lied to me .
like always , he was protecting me .
your father and i , we ...
share the same protective instinct .
the reason i didn &apos;t tell you i &apos;d found kara
is because i wanted to make sure she couldn &apos;t hurt you .
there &apos;s something else you need to know about your mother .
gordon murphy wasn &apos;t just her savior .
he was her husband .
no .
she told me herself .
and after she tased me and left me to die ,
i believe her .
i &apos;ve been so driven to find her ,
i never stopped to consider who she is .
then you let me help you remember
what you came here to do--
avenge your father &apos;s death .
you &apos;re takeda &apos;s proxy .
use that to get inside grayson global
and destabilize the company .
that &apos;s the best way to ferret them out .
hey , you sure you &apos;re all right ?
i needed someone .
you walked through the door .
don &apos;t let it go to your head .
mrs. grayson , there &apos;s someone here to see you .
tell them i &apos;m not accepting any visitors .
victoria .
kara clarke .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re safe .
such a beautiful home .
so smart to build it right on the ocean .
you can always see your enemies coming .
well , my enemies have become increasingly difficult to identify .
oh , i know .
i was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you
was the fbi agent you &apos;d been working with .
he seemed like a good man .
all men are born hardwired to betray .
it &apos;s just a question of when .
do they have any leads on his whereabouts ?
no , they don &apos;t .
but i &apos;m so relieved that you didn &apos;t fall victim to him as well .
oh , no .
he gave me a new life ,
taught me how to live off the grid .
i hadn &apos;t seen him for 20 years .
then he shows up a few months ago .
why &apos;d he go to you ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you file a statement with the authorities ?
no . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sure you can appreciate why .
yes .
where do you think he is ?
if he &apos;s wise , far , far away from here .
and as you pointed out ,
he &apos;s very gifted at the art of vanishing .
but i imagine your main concern is about amanda .
of course .
you &apos;ve been so incredibly kind to her ...
bringing her into your home ...
and in such a public way .
i never would &apos;ve been able to find her otherwise .
well , it was the least i could do for her , poor thing .
tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes .
i &apos;m such a dope .
may i wash up ?
well , i take no pleasure in saying this ,
but we fear grayson global may be an unrightable ship .
your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion .
discretion , or secrecy , rather , is the problem .
when daniel first brought mr. takeda into the fold ,
he offered a hands @-@ on approach .
and since the feud between you and your son
was on full display at the board meeting last week ,
that which i do see does not inspire confidence .
oh , the graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline .
whatever disagreement you may have witnessed ,
i assure you , there is no rift .
with all due respect ,
my employer requires greater assurances .
daniel grayson .
son , i am sitting with aiden mathis ,
mr. takeda &apos;s proxy .
i &apos;d like you to make good on your promise of transparency
and acquaint aiden with all aspects of our organization .
i am sending him to you now .
excuse me .
what is it , sweetheart ? i &apos;m busy .
too busy to deal with the fact
that kara clarke is still alive ?
uh , thank you , mr. mathis .
would you mind closing the door ?
of course .
thank you .
is this a joke ?
no , conrad .
at this very moment ,
she &apos;s in our powder room washing blood off her hands ,
literally .
i thought gordon murphy took care of her decades ago .
you &apos;ve got to get rid of her .
oh , on the contrary .
i &apos;ve asked her to stay for lunch .
are you out of your mind ?
last i heard , kara clarke was a violent psychopath .
don &apos;t you find it interesting that
she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall ?
she could be the source of the journals ,
the log @-@ in sheet , everything .
i want to see you here in one hour .
hey , declan .
hey .
i thought you should have this back .
it was very gentlemanly of you .
oh , yeah .
we porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen .
i &apos;m headed to the hospital to check in on amanda
and the latest little porter .
you want to come with ?
uh , you know , you might want to wait .
jack said they may try to bring her out of it today .
does that mean she &apos;s okay ?
i hope so , for everyone &apos;s sake .
but i gotta get this stuff done
so little carl has a home to come back to .
okay . i guess i &apos;ll see you around .
i &apos;m beginning to understand why you robbed me .
girl like that &apos;s not gonna go for a groupon .
you got it all wrong , man . i barely even know her .
satisfy my curiosity .
why &apos;d you do it ?
i don &apos;t have the money to go to college , okay ?
right .
that &apos;d make for one hell of an admissions essay--
&quot; how i rolled houses for a brighter future . &quot;
you think i &apos;m an idiot . i get it .
on the contrary .
you remind me of myself at your age .
call this guy .
he &apos;s got a certified crew
that &apos;ll do the work here for half the price twice as fast .
and why--why would you help me ?
&apos;cause i want my money back sooner than later .
and whatever you got in that little spray bottle
is not getting the job done .
call or don &apos;t call .
but if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you
as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer ,
and i can tell you do ,
you &apos;ll need that degree .
i gotta lay you down , buddy .
papa porter .
congrats , pal .
hey , how you holding up , huh ?
uh , i &apos;m a little tired .
i bet .
how &apos;s mama mandy ?
she &apos;s gettin &apos; better by the minute .
uh , wow , jack .
that is one hell of a swaddle .
oh , well , get this .
his grandmother taught me .
what , your mom &apos;s back ?
not mine .
hers .
y @-@ you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re not serious .
i know , right ?
as if things aren &apos;t messy enough .
oh , uh , they--they do hourly checks .
eh , say no more . i , uh , have to go see someone anyway .
hang in there , pal .
encouraging numbers .
you should also read the analysis .
why ? would it tell me a different story ?
it will if my dad took a pass ...
daniel ,
an alert &apos;s come through the system .
ashley davenport , aiden mathis .
charmed . we didn &apos;t officially get to meet the other day .
hello .
hi .
aiden is mr. takeda &apos;s proxy .
my father asked me to acquaint him
with all things grayson global .
so whatever you have to say , feel free to say it .
personnel &apos;s flagged an outside request
for david clarke &apos;s employment contract .
that &apos;s right .
a bona fide terrorist used to work here .
that &apos;s something we try hard to forget .
who &apos;s looking for it ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe a meeting might be prudent .
set it up . let &apos;s see who &apos;s suddenly curious .
now back to the quarterlies .
suddenly , i &apos;m more interested
in this company &apos;s more historic associations .
why don &apos;t we introduce mr. mathis
to the power of the corporate card ?
drinks tonight at rinellas ?
来自卡拉
hello ?
someone &apos;s interested in your father &apos;s contract at grayson global .
any reason to think it &apos;s your mother ?
i don &apos;t even know where she is .
i &apos;ve checked every hotel and hostel in the area .
did you check the graysons &apos; ?
conrad took a phone call from victoria ,
paled at the sound of her voice .
emily !
keep me posted .
way to keep me out of the loop , ems .
your mother &apos;s summering in the hamptons ?
who told you that ?
jack ,
who &apos;s currently registering a 6 on the freak @-@ o @-@ meter .
me ? i &apos;m at 9,
which must put you at infinity times infinity .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
well , assuming you don &apos;t have time to check your messages either .
otherwise you &apos;d know that , uh ...
my dad died .
oh , my god , nolan .
look , i know he wasn &apos;t murdered in prison
or accused of a crime he didn &apos;t commit ,
still ...
turns out he loved me .
i should &apos;ve been there for you .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
but enough about that .
tell me about kara clarke .
all i can tell you is that she thinks amanda is her daughter .
that &apos;s good for ... revenge @-@ y stuff ,
but sad for you .
i &apos;m sorry , ems .
let &apos;s see .
so what are your plans , ms. clarke ?
i should hope that you &apos;d stay with us .
she &apos;s staying at the graysons &apos; ?
you think it &apos;s safe here ?
what about your kidnapper ?
that man is nothing more than a slippery coward
who wouldn &apos;t have the guts to darken our doorstep .
even if he did , he &apos;d be shot on sight .
in other words ,
so long as you remain under our roof , you &apos;ll be safe .
no place like home . huh , auntie ems ?
hey , jack .
emily ...
oh , my god .
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
amanda &apos;s out of her coma .
well , that &apos;s good . right ?
it is until my mother hears the news .
she &apos;s not out of the woods yet .
hey , welcome back .
we got someone here who wants to meet you .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s him ?
is he okay ?
this is your mommy .
he &apos;s so little .
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s tougher than he looks , like his mom .
i didn &apos;t know the two of you would be here when i woke up .
well , we &apos;re here .
neither one of us is going anywhere . all right ?
thanks for coming back to us . i couldn &apos;t do this alone .
welcome back , amanda .
we &apos;re gonna go home soon , okay ?
where &apos;s mommy ?
what do you remember last ?
we were swimming .
do you know how sometimes when people get sick ,
no matter how hard they try
and no matter how many doctors help ,
they just aren &apos;t able to get better ?
but mommy said she was better .
she wanted to be .
she wanted that more than anything .
but i--
she just-- she wasn &apos;t strong enough .
where is she ?
she &apos;s ... gone .
i &apos;m so sorry , honey .
i &apos;ll let you two get acquainted .
you must be so relieved .
look , i know the stowaway &apos;s not open yet ,
and amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house ,
so they &apos;re welcome to stay with me temporarily .
are you sure ?
carl has a lot of stuff
for someone who only weighs 7 pounds .
i &apos;ll always have a room for him .
have you called amanda &apos;s mom yet ?
i wanted to wait until i told her that she was back .
that &apos;s a good idea .
and you should go home , take a break ...
change your clothes .
i stink ?
eh , a shower wouldn &apos;t kill you .
thanks , emily .
hey , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m running home for a bit ,
but emily &apos;s here if you need anything , okay ?
congratulations .
he &apos;s somethin &apos; .
yeah . he is .
we &apos;re survivors .
amanda , i had no right to put you in that situation .
i &apos;m so sorry .
so the hunt for your mother is over ?
she &apos;s back , amanda .
she showed up last night .
good .
so at least it wasn &apos;t all for nothing .
ms. clarke ?
you ready to come with me for those last few tests ?
i can look after carl if you wanna go .
is that where david lived ?
he told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door .
i &apos;m sorry if that makes you uncomfortable .
well , thinking about david always makes me uncomfortable .
i imagine that &apos;s something we both share .
why did you save me all those years ago ?
a lot of women would &apos;ve felt threatened by me .
although ...
technically , you &apos;re the other woman , not me .
you know , he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time .
obviously , we both fell prey to david &apos;s deception .
and now gordon &apos;s .
mom ?
i just got off the phone with the hospital .
amanda &apos;s awake and okay .
charlotte , this is amanda &apos;s mother ,
kara clarke .
i &apos;m going to the hospital .
i &apos;ll come back and bring my things .
thank you .
you asked her to stay with us ?
temporarily , yes .
i feel so bad about what happened to her daughter
that i just wanted to help out .
maybe you have changed .
dec !
what the hell , man ? it smells terrible in here .
i know . i &apos;m doing the best i can with what we have ... pops .
how &apos;s amanda ?
she &apos;s good .
she &apos;s good . we &apos;re , uh ... we &apos;re good .
good . that &apos;s good .
yeah , well , something &apos;s gotta be
when i &apos;m standing in the place
that &apos;s supposed to be making us our living
and paying these hospital bills .
i know . um , kenny stopped by today with a plan &quot; b. &quot;
he says that that guy can get done what we need
fast and cheap .
i like the sound of that .
yeah , me , too ,
only my judgment &apos;s been a little bit off lately and ...
yeah , well , i wanted to wait for your okay .
well , he &apos;s a businessman who wants his money .
why have us waste any more of it , right ?
i &apos;ll give this guy a call right now .
thank you for coming in .
i &apos;m daniel gray--
daniel grayson .
i know . padma lahari ,
nolcorp c.f.o.
i hope everything &apos;s okay ?
why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
in my experience ,
when a simple request gets an outsized response ,
either something &apos;s wrong or i &apos;ve won something .
have i won something ?
let &apos;s see what we &apos;re playing for , shall we ?
please , sit .
i understand you &apos;re looking for information about david clarke .
yes . i need to corroborate his initial terms of employment
at grayson global .
i hope you can understand the sensitivity
we still feel over the unfortunate association
this company has with such a man .
yes . i imagine it can be quite tricky .
tell me ,
what do the terms of mr. clarke &apos;s employment
at a wall street investment firm
have to do with a tech company like nolcorp ?
i wanted to make sure
that when nolcorp invested in grayson global years ago
that david clarke wasn &apos;t on the account .
it wouldn &apos;t do to have a terrorist handling our finances ,
would it ?
i &apos;ll look into it and get back to you .
and much obliged .
so that explains that .
i &apos;m not sure it does .
tyler tried to land nolcorp last summer for the first time ,
which means they &apos;ve never invested with us before .
are we still on for drinks ?
where are you taking my grandson ?
i was just trying to settle him .
i &apos;m his godmother .
i &apos;m kara ,
amanda &apos;s actual mother .
may i ?
don &apos;t worry .
he knows his family .
amanda was the same way ,
always happy in her mommy &apos;s arms .
the perfect little baby boy .
what was amanda like as a kid ?
she ...
she was so gentle .
she wouldn &apos;t even let me kill a spider .
no matter how big or small ,
i had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside .
she just always had this innate goodness .
does she ever talk about me ?
honestly , no .
when was the last time you saw her ?
well , now that is a fascinating question .
oh , please allow me to introduce myself .
mason treadwell .
and is it possible that you &apos;re kara clarke ?
yes . yes , i am .
god , i love the hamptons .
you see , i was inexorably drawn back here
in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter &apos;s recent welcome
into the grayson fold ,
which makes your appearance ...
how shall i say it ? a revelation .
are you for real ?
oh , i am , my dear , and so wonderfully are you .
the years have been kind , kara .
where have you been ?
away .
oh , that &apos;s one of my favorite places .
if you don &apos;t mind my asking ,
why let your daughter think
that you were deceased these last two decades ?
i do .
i do mind you asking .
when you get a c.a.t. scan , you throw me a party .
well , admittedly , i &apos;m a crasher ,
but one who only brings well @-@ wishes .
what the hell are you doing here ?
paying my respects , of course .
please , allow me .
please .
i think you &apos;ve done quite enough , mason .
i &apos;ll come back .
amanda , sweetie ...
do you remember me ?
i think carl &apos;s hungry .
i &apos;ll bring him to you .
oh , sweetheart .
kara , i think we should let these two rest .
when amanda &apos;s released ,
she &apos;ll be staying with me for a few days .
perhaps you &apos;d like to come visit in the morning ?
yes .
maybe i could drive you home .
she didn &apos;t recognize me . i really thought she would .
can &apos;t imagine how that must feel .
have you read treadwell &apos;s book ?
mm . i still can &apos;t accept
that david was capable of such terrible things .
he was my high school sweetheart .
can you believe that ?
you never know when or how you &apos;ll meet your true love .
he was only my first love .
there &apos;s a difference .
well , at least david didn &apos;t destroy amanda .
no .
he didn &apos;t .
i know i &apos;ve been a.w.o.l. , but ...
i just became an uncle .
well , one of those non @-@ uncle uncles ,
like kracker or fester .
pretty sure fester actually was gomez &apos;s older brother .
all right , you pass .
where did you get this ?
it was amongst your father &apos;s memorabilia .
you did nothing with it ?
no . why ?
should i ?
nope .
i &apos;ll take care of it , but ...
not before i take you to breakfast .
but it &apos;s 10 : 00 at night , nolan .
then we &apos;ve got some time to kill .
to a growing relationship , both business and personal .
well , tell that to my dad .
the company &apos;s falling apart , and he leaves before lunch .
which is something i &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t want me
to convey to mr. takeda .
you see , this is why we english are stereotyped as reserved .
candor runs the risk of brooking discontent .
oh , well , the american way is truth , honesty ...
and a tiny bladder .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i ...
need to use the loo .
very good .
you make a nice couple .
what about you ? anyone special ?
well , the nomadic lifestyle
doesn &apos;t allow for much permanence , i &apos;m afraid .
although mr. takeda did mention somebody that i should look up .
uh , a miss , um ...
emily ... thorpe ?
thorne .
she and daniel used to be engaged .
well , leave it to me to step in it .
oh , no , you didn &apos;t . she did .
she cheated on him .
well , to , uh , your good fortune and , um , maybe mine .
we nomads have little need for fidelity ,
so i may ring her up .
you can &apos;t be here .
but you told me to keep you posted .
no , i mean , you can &apos;t be here .
my mother is next door .
she sees you , our cover &apos;s blown--
not just with her but with the graysons ,
which would never have happened if you hadn &apos;t gone to
see her in the first place .
what do you want ?
to inform you that the inquiry about your father &apos;s contract
came from a woman named padma lahari ,
claiming to be nolcorp &apos;s c.f.o.
she pulls that thread ,
it could expose the source of your wealth .
i liquidated my nolcorp stock years ago .
but this could be bad for nolan .
well , he &apos;s not my concern .
well , he &apos;s mine .
what &apos;s she doing ?
that &apos;s his phone , isn &apos;t it ?
you had it all along .
answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do .
you wanna do this alone ?
fine .
but you &apos;ll soon find out i make a far
better partner than enemy .
how long until high tide ?
20 minutes ?
i like living on the edge of ...
the land ,
the water ,
of the honeydew .
morning , sunshine .
we need to talk .
i &apos;ve been trying to get ahold of you all night .
sounds serious .
need my help ?
no . you need mine .
i &apos;m already shocked .
someone from your company asked daniel
about my father &apos;s investment .
nolan , it was padma .
you okay ?
then drink up before we &apos;re underwater .
just one night , i promise .
not a problem .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna--i &apos;m gonna take off and go to the stowaway , okay ?
okay .
thanks again .
is everything okay ?
depends who you ask .
jack seems happy
with his little carl .
but every time i see him holding the baby , i just ...
i wanna tell him the truth , that carl isn &apos;t his .
but , of course , i have to deal with your mom first .
all you have to do is tell her the truth ,
that you don &apos;t know who she is and she has to leave .
you spent all this time ,
risked my life looking for her ,
and now you just want her to leave ?
while you were recovering ,
a memory came back to me .
when i was 5 , my mother tried to kill me .
she succeeded , actually .
she drowned me .
my father had to bring me back to life .
i ... how could a mother do that ?
maybe someday i &apos;ll know , but for now ...
the best thing for us , and especially for carl ,
is that she leaves .
call her .
see , that &apos;s the thing about martinis .
two &apos;s not enough , four is too many .
i could use another drink after the morning we &apos;re having .
you should tell takeda to take his money and run .
but that would debilitate grayson global .
well , maybe we deserve it .
i know how you feel about your father .
it &apos;s obvious that &apos;s why you want us to divest .
i feel the same way about the chains that bind me .
so ?
i may have something .
it &apos;s about the nolcorp request .
okay , how do you know about that ?
because i &apos;m ambitious , same as you .
when david clarke worked here ,
he ran venture capital , right ?
what if nolan ross came to him for start @-@ up money ?
but he didn &apos;t , or there &apos;d be a record of it .
not if the money he invested came from a personal account .
see , i think the young lady from nolcorp
was trying to sniff out whether or not clarke &apos;s contract
contained an exclusivity clause .
which it would have . they all do .
which means he was working on behalf of the company ,
regardless of where the capital came from .
which also means ...
this company has a controlling interest in nolcorp .
we play this right , we guarantee two things--
me a seat here on the board , and you ...
the seat behind your father &apos;s desk .
put me through to personnel .
archives .
there may be no sadder sight
than a woman attempting to rob her own house .
unless , of course , you misplaced something ,
like the dead woman who i hear has been sleeping in this bed .
though being dead is de rigueur around here these days .
you should try it sometime , mason .
and how did you get in here ?
every maid has her price ,
especially when grotesquely underpaid .
i read your &quot; vanity fair &quot; article .
it was like gazing at your lovely visage , victoria--
the most elegant blend of fact and fiction .
what do you want ?
what do any of us want ?
the truth .
i came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story ,
but now i &apos;ve stumbled across something that &apos;s far juicier .
now if memory serves ,
you told me that kara clarke was dead .
i honestly believed that .
do you ... gag a little when you say that ? &quot; honestly &quot; ?
i think you &apos;ve failed to understand
the threat kara poses to all of us .
she may know the truth about david ,
in which case , she will take you down along with us .
i think i &apos;ll be fine .
sorry .
i &apos;ll leave you two alone .
i &apos;ll be right here .
i ...
i understand if you want nothing to do with me .
so i &apos;ll just ...
i &apos;ll just say my piece then go .
despite ...
all the odds against you ,
you survived .
and you &apos;ve grown into an amazing ,
amazing young woman .
you &apos;re strong .
you &apos;re independent .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re everything
that i ... could ever have hoped for you to be .
you need to know that , um ,
i was very sick ...
for a long time .
and i w--
i was not fully in control of my actions .
and ...
your father and i
made a choice ...
one that i knew i would h @-@ have to live with .
you need to tell her i died .
it &apos;ll be better for her if she thinks i &apos;m gone .
somehow , your father found it in his heart
to forgive me .
wait .
i forgive you , too .
so this is it . we &apos;re in the clear .
we can finally start paying you back .
well ... there may be a bigger opportunity here .
frankly , i &apos;ve always wanted to be in the bar business .
you wanna buy it ?
i will forgive your kid brother &apos;s debt if you let me .
i asked around , jack ,
heard what this place did to you .
your mom left . your dad died .
so you wanna pull 14 @-@ hour shifts
or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family ?
okay . let &apos;s talk .
i knew you were smart .
well ... what &apos;d the inspector say ?
there &apos;s the boy wonder .
dec , we &apos;re back in business
and we couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
are you seriously reading a book ?
yeah , it calms me . you should try it .
well , i found this hidden in kara &apos;s room .
there &apos;s one number on it .
that &apos;s gordon murphy &apos;s number .
she &apos;s made calls out . none came in .
kara &apos;s been feeding him information .
too many people know our secrets , conrad .
and if they surface ,
the initiative is going to come after us--
and worse , our children .
i don &apos;t know who to turn to .
you can turn to me , of course .
oh , please .
victoria grayson ,
will you do me the honor of becoming my wife ?
again .
what is the matter with you ?
j @-@ just let me finish .
to have and to hold , and to be legally bound
so that we may never be compelled
to testify against each other in a court of law .
i &apos;m sorry about what i said to your mom .
forgiving her , it just ... came out .
don &apos;t be .
you did the right thing .
i need to tell you something about carl .
i lied to you .
jack really is the father .
oh , my god .
why would you do that to me ?
i guess i felt like i needed to keep you on my side .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ?
maybe because of it .
i know i haven &apos;t given you any reason to believe this .
i &apos;m so sorry .
me , too .
i knew you had feelings for jack
when i tricked him into believing i was you .
and now i have this incredible family .
it &apos;s not fair . you deserve better , and ...
jack deserves the truth .
jack deserves happiness .
if you tell him the truth now ,
it &apos;ll only break his heart all over again .
over time , we commit acts with intentions ,
either good or bad , that require forgiveness .
i think my family could &apos;ve been happy here .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
it &apos;s okay .
who knows ? maybe david wouldn &apos;t have made the mistakes he made .
maybe none of us would have .
trust me . just as many mistakes are made here .
do you think she really forgives me ?
i think she wants to .
just the woman i was looking for .
a quick raid of my research confirmed that
you had a terrible scar
from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire--
one that i couldn &apos;t help but notice is now missing .
i had it removed .
did you ?
from what part of your body ?
why do you care , mason ?
i think you and i both know
the answer to that question , my dear .
you may be many things to many people--
the latest , it would seem , a young mother to an infant boy .
but the daughter of kara wallace and david clarke ?
that is one thing that you most definitely are not .
