Oh, honey, more overtime?
I was hoping you'd be home.
no, it's okay.
I understand.
Yeah, I got all the way there with the baby,
And he was out on an emergency.
That's weird. The heat's off.
I love you, too, honey.
You look a little...Naked.
Excuse me?
I can see your knees.
You want me to write him up for harassment?
Yes.
You do look nice, though.
I always like you in your court outfits.
You can write yourself up, too.
Did you hear about Cal?
Cal Ghetts died?
How's miss Ghetts doing?
Nice lady.
I always see her in church.
How'd he die?
He was mugged last night in Atlantic city.
Didn't he just retire?
A month ago.
30 years in the arson unit, and he gets shot on vacation.
Nervous about testifying?
I've only done it once.
all Cavanaugh and I have to do
is establish chain of custody
to get Paddy's ledger admitted into evidence.
I'll be glad when you get rid of that copy of his damn book.
Can I see it?
No.
And you don't want to.
Yes, I do.
Wait, you guys didn't read it?
I'm from southie, Frost.
For all I know, I got cousins in that book.
I see you downloaded a copy of the federal indictment.
It's interesting.
You ever tried a rico case before?
No.
Me either.
Look at all these counts -- loan-sharking, bookmaking,
trafficking in narcotics -- oh, and 15 counts of murder.
How did the feds establish that Paddy ordered the hits?
Rico case is all about proving
that Paddy was the head of a crime syndicate,
and he didn't have to pull the trigger himself.
With Donovan's testimony,
The government can prove Paddy was behind 15 murders.
So, why's the book so important?
It corroborates his story.
This is the only guy still alive
that can tie Paddy to all those murders.
Rizzoli, gonna need you in my office.
A.U.S.A.'s here.
Good luck.
You don't have to say a word
If you just show the judge those knees.
The judge is a woman.
Hope.
I was going to leave these at your door, but I saw your car.
Come in.
We always said we were going to have coffee.
Thank you.
Is Angela here?
No.
She is out of town, visiting her sister.
I am playing hooky.
I was just about to make some espresso.
Ah, la pavoni.
Oh, I had one once.
La pavoni was founded in Milan in 1905 --
by Desiderio Pavoni,
Uh, in a little workshop on via Parini.
Uh, el salvador miravalle and
I also smell Brazil, fazenda cachoeria.
Hmm?
That's amazing.
Where you think you came from?
Cailin puts goopy syrup in hers.
no idea where she came from.
She's 19.
You know, I hate to admit it,
But I was addicted to corn syrup at that age.
I wish I'd known you then.
And I wish that you had known him.
This is not the man that I fell in love with,
Not the man who fathered you.
How did you meet?
I was studying,
And I saw him drawing me, so we started talking.
Is it hard for you to look at that?
It's his drawing of you at 19,
Mourning my death.
My mother -- Constance --
She -- she hung it in a hallway.
I don't know why I -- I always liked it.
And now that I know my own story,
I just stare at it and think about what might have been.
I think about what might have been, too.
He was thoughtful and smart and unbelievably kind.
And that sounds crazy now.
I've never said this to anyone.
It could be easily misinterpreted.
But I've caught him looking at me,
And I see that man.
Oh, that hurt.
Let me see.
Oh, it's fine.
The steam wand is 240 degrees. You're not fine.
Go. Run this under cold water.
I have some extra bandages in that drawer.
Actually, I prefer hemostatic trauma gauze.
What, you carry it with you?
Since 1988.
I took care of Saddam's burn victims in northern Iraq.
That's not too bad.
No.
Are you going to the trial?
No, I can't watch them put him away.
Do you think you'll have to testify --
I mean, about M.E.N.D.?
No.
It seems that the FBI has more pressing things to do
than to shut down an international aid organization.
So, you're not worried that someday they'll just come in
and seize the $2.5 million that Paddy gave you to start M.E.N.D.?
I will talk with you about anything but that.
The less you know, the safer you are.
I know you don't approve of what I've done.
Paddy terrorized an entire community.
That's how he got that money.
But that money ultimately saved
the lives of a lot of innocent people.
Yeah, but you can't forget that it also cost
the lives of a lot of innocent people.
What Paddy did is indefensible...
And maybe what I've done is, too.
There.
All better.
So, after we get through establishing your credentials,
I will hold up the book, walk you through my questions.
And once the book is admitted, Jackie Donovan becomes key.
Yes.
I don't envy you guys.
Jackie's wife, Roberta, is a handful.
God. No kidding.
We've been moving them
every 24 hours for a year because of her.
You knew her?
Yeah. I grow up in southie.
That's right.
Paddy was your C.I.
Paddy Doyle was your informant?
Yeah, we asked the lieutenant to keep that quiet
until we knew we didn't need him for our rico case.
It's gonna sound strange, but when I was growing up,
we all looked up to Paddy Doyle.
When the Colombians started moving cocaine through southie,
he reached out to me.
He wanted the drugs out of the neighborhood, same as me.
You're not getting sentimental on me, are you, lieutenant?
He did one good thing. He's still a bad guy.
I can't wait for this to be over.
Yeah, me, too.
I've been practicing this opening argument for 20 years.
Wish me luck.
You're not gonna need luck.
We'll get him.
That stuff is so bad for you.
We got the non-fat creamer in the break room.
I need something with fat in it today.
Did you know that Paddy was Cavanaugh's C.I.?
Yeah.
In 93, we worked the D.C.U. together.
I was doing the new york crack boys.
He was working the Colombians.
What? What is it?
Oh, nothing, I...
Every time I think about working drugs with him,
I think about Linda and his son.
Doesn't he have a daughter, too?
They're not close.
He wasn't married to the mother.
That's Linda and Christopher.
They died in a fire.
Defective gas valve filled the cellar with gas,
Ignited when Linda turned on the heat.
Cavanaugh was working overtime when we got the news.
I thought we'd never get
him back from the bottom of a shot glass.
That had to be hard to watch a tough guy like Cavanaugh
go through something like that.
I don't ever want to see anything like it again.
Are you heading to court?
Uh, no, it's Maura. I'm gonna go check on her.
She sick?
Sick of being in the news.
Maura!
In here.
What are you doing?
Child's pose. It's good for indigestion.
Only you would have a yoga room.
No shoes.
Sorry.
Do you want me to chant something
to ward off the evil shoe spirits?
Couldn't hurt.
Oh, that feels great. I could do this all day.
The judge would issue a bench warrant for you if you did.
I got your text.
So, you and Hope geeked out over coffee?
That sounds nice.
It wasn't.
I gave her a hard time.
You know, she's saved thousands of innocent people
who were caught in wars and natural disasters, but...
But you just can't get over the fact
that her humanitarian organization only exists
because she took paddy's dirty money?
Exactly.
Show me a yoga pose that ends all problems.
Mm, we'd have to move to the yoga colony
in Shivajinagar, Pune.
Poo-na?
I'm not moving to Poo-na.
Do you miss your father?
Yeah, I do.
You think if I tracked him down in Florida
and forced myself to watch him
snuggle with his slutty blond girlfriend
that I wouldn't miss him so much?
No.
What makes you think she's blond?
They're always blond.
Okay, I got to go to court.
I'm coming with you.
You sure?
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do.
That man is my father,
and I have to see this through.
And could you describe the location, detective?
Oh, the Boston cemetery.
And can you tell us what you found there?
A plastic bag with a blue ledger in it.
Detective, is this the ledger that you found?
Yes.
Thank you. No further questions.
Okay, we're off to a good start.
Thank you, both.
Okay.
What? What is it?
Your phones were off. Jackie Donovan is dead.
What?!
U.S. Marshals' car he was in was t-boned by a semi
on Congress and Atlantic Avenue about 10 minutes ago.
That's just around the corner.
Jackie Donovan's dead.
Paddy got to him.
It looks like it.
Two U.S. Marshals are dead, too.
So, what does this mean for the trial?
It means Paddy won the first round.
It is obvious that this is no accident, your honor.
Five minutes before our key witness is supposed to testify
and half a block away from your courtroom,
he is killed by teamsters driving a truck?
I think we all know who's behind this.
Your honor, there's no evidence
that this is anything more than a tragic accident.
"Tragic accident."
The government asks for two days to regroup.
Two-day delay? Does counsel think he can resurrect a dead man?
As tragic as this is,
let me remind you this trial has already started.
Call your next witness.
Your honor, the prosecution had anticipated...
Why can't he call his next witness?
He doesn't have another witness ready,
and he certainly doesn't have another Jackie Donovan.
Your honor, my client has been in jail for over a year.
The entirety of the government's case
seems to rest on a now dead witness.
We just need a continuance, your honor.
We'll be ready in 48 hours.
At the very least, my client should be considered for bail.
Bail?
They'll never do that.
And in a twist
legal pundits will be talking about for years,
the judge granted bail
for the alleged head of the southie crime family,
Paddy Doyle.
The Federal government
has been skating on thin ice for a long time,
and today, they fell in.
Thank you.
Clearly, the judge was stuck
between a rock and a hard place.
The prosecution wasn't ready to proceed...
I don't believe this.
Why are they shaking his hand?
They're from southie -- if Paddy's out,
you want to be on his good side.
The judge had no choice
but to reconsider the issue of bail.
He can't get away with this.
I would've said that yesterday. I don't know about today.
Did you get him to talk?
Oh, yeah. Can't get him to stop.
He said my father hired a couple of teamsters
to run their truck into the marshals' van.
Said it was pretty quick,
except for the one who bled out before the ambulance arrived.
Poor guys -- just doing their jobs.
And how are we supposed to do ours?
I mean, he's out, Jane. How did this happen?
How? We'll, he's always eight chess moves ahead.
Where do you think you got your I.Q. points?
Don't remind me.
He'll only be out for a couple of days,
and they got him wearing the ankle bracelet.
I'm sure the feds are watching his every move.
We may have something.
Well, that's good news.
Shouldn't we go up to the squad room?
We can't, Jane.
Why not?
Cavanaugh can't know about this.
Calvin Ghetts investigated the fire that killed his family.
What does Cal have to do with Paddy Doyle?
We were about to make a deal with Ghetts
to testify against him.
Cal was dirty?
Oh, my god.
Wait a minute. Did Paddy send someone
to Atlantic City to take him out before he could talk?
We think so.
The FBI thinks Paddy paid Ghetts
to burn down buildings in the '90s,
falsify arson reports
so Paddy could buy condemned property for a song.
But you could never prove that.
No, not until Calvin Ghetts told me in a phone call
before he died that he had saved evidence
that could prove that Paddy was behind that fire.
Cal set the fire...
and you were granting him immunity
in exchange for the evidence in his testimony.
Right.
You were gonna make a deal with a man
who killed a police officer's wife and baby?
Maura, sometimes you got to dance with the devil
to get a conviction --
Especially for two capital murders.
So you're gonna seek the death penalty.
If you're conflicted, Doctor,
I won't ask you to help investigate this.
I'm a physician, Mr. King. I don't wish death on anyone.
That doesn't mean I won't help you.
Wait a minute. Help you with what?
You don't have a case without Cal Ghetts.
I don't have any more time.
I need you to find that evidence.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
All right? All we have are Cal's arson files.
Maybe there's something there.
Yeah, but what?
You had 20 years and your own task force
to make an arson connection
between Cal Ghetts and Paddy Doyle.
Now you want us to find something in 36 hours?
I'm not gonna lie to you -- it's a Hail Mary pass.
Well, you better hope we can catch.
These are the last two.
I don't think they'll be any help.
They're from 2004.
We've been through everything from 1993.
His file on Cavanaugh's apartment fire isn't in here.
I keep telling 'em it's time to scan everything.
Did anyone talk to Cal's wife yet?
No.
Oh, man, I really should go over there
and give her my condolences.
Hey, Frost, go now.
Well, it's late.
No, but we're running out of time,
and Cal might have kept the file at home.
Well, you better come with me.
It'd be good to have a woman there --
Make her feel more comfortable.
Well, I want to go through '92 and '94.
The case might be misfiled.
I can go.
But you're not a detective.
Well, I'm a woman who makes people feel comfortable,
and you're busy, Jane.
We'll say we're there to bring her the collection money.
We've got a lot to do here, Jane.
Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, do it.
Do you know what time it is?
Miss Ghetts?
Barold?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to come by and say...
I'm very sorry for you loss.
Detective Ghetts was a good man.
This is from everyone at the station.
Thank you. That's very kind.
This is my colleague, dr. Isles.
We're all very sorry for your loss.
We know how difficult it must be.
Miss Ghetts, we were closing
some of Cal's open arson cases,
and we haven't been able to find some of his files.
We were wondering if perhaps he brought his work home.
He kept his files in the garage, yes,
but it got broken into when we were...
when we were in Atlantic City.
I know this is an imposition,
but would it be possible for you to show us the garage?
It's just Cal's junk and old files.
They really tore the place apart.
Too bad they didn't take that hunk of junk.
Calvin said this was our big retirement nest egg.
"Shirley, no matter what happens,
don't you ever sell the Granada."
You wouldn't get more than $500 for it.
Oh, you might get more than that.
No, she's right. I looked it up on "Car Buyers."
But your husband said it was your nest egg?
Every time we had a cash-flow issue
he'd tell me...not to worry.
"It's all right here, honey."
I'm sorry.
This is just too hard right now.
Excuse me.
Paddy's guys tore this place apart.
But they left the car.
Can you check in the glove compartment?
Sure.
Nothing in the trunk.
Yeah, nothing in the glove compartment or inside the car.
If old Cal hid something in the car,
Paddy's guys would have found it.
Yeah, but this car hasn't been moved in years.
And there's plenty of places to hide things,
especially if the car doesn't need to be driven.
I'm thinking like a drug dealer.
Well, don't you think Paddy's guys think like drug dealers?
It's worth a try.
Uh, I'll get a search warrant going.
We'll take all this and we'll do what Paddy's guys couldn't do --
Pull this car apart.
It's Jane. She wants to know if we have anything.
Not until we have the search warrant.
Go get some food. I'll stay here.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, I already ate.
I am craving a tempeh bacon burger.
Make sure Jane eats something, too.
You know she forgets sometimes.
I feel guilty.
You have to eat.
We'll get it to go.
To Paddy!
Look at him -- he thinks he's already gotten away with it.
He's killed four people in the last two days.
Let's go, Maura.
You know, they've even changed the menu for him.
They're serving him beef with french fries.
Maybe it's locally sourced.
Let's go. This is not helping anything.
Maura.
Three more men are lying on my autopsy tables because of you.
Maura, I had nothing to do with that crash.
I wish Jane had killed you.
Hi. How is she?
Not good.
Does she know I'm here?
She asked me to call you.
Hey, Maura?
Hope's here.
Just in the middle of getting the pills out of my cashmere blends.
Maura...
I told him I wished he was dead.
No, I -- I don't really like to be hugged when I'm very upset.
Got to get these sheath dresses off the floor before they wrinkle.
Yes, it is strange getting to know her as an adult.
I can't even imagine.
Every year on her birthday, I would come to Boston,
and I'd visit her grave.
And I would add up the years, and I would think about...
how old she'd be and wonder what she'd turn out to be.
Well, is she anything like you imagined?
She's better.
She's so much better than I imagined,
and I have a good imagination.
I'm so sorry.
I should have offered you some tea.
And girl scout cookies.
I ate them all.
Even the Thin Mints?
I ate those first.
Damn.
I know this is your house, but could I make you some tea?
I would like that.
Sometimes...the only way for me to turn off
the panicky thoughts in my head at night
is the thought of espresso in the morning.
Me too.
Would you like some?
Oh, no, that'll keep me up all night.
Thank you.
What can I do?
Go back 37 years and sleep with a different man?
Well, can we give you a hug now?
It won't help.
Can we try?
Thank you.
How's she doing?
She's okay.
She'd be a lot better
if we could find something in Cal's granada.
Any news on the car?
CSRU took apart the doors,
the engine, the dashboard.
Nothing so far.
Where else would Cal hide that file?
Maybe we don't have to find the file.
If Cal set the fire, Paddy would've paid him to do it.
Which means Paddy would
have kept a record of it in his little book.
Yeah. Here.
Here, everybody take a section.
Paddy wrote everything in code.
"Big head rent lo broad"?
"Big head" meant Michael Wynne.
"Rent" meant shaking down store owners on "Lo broad,"
Which is the lower end of west broadway.
How do I explain my presence if Lieutenant Cavanaugh comes in?
Tell him you have menstrual cramps.
That does make any sense.
Oh, yes, it does.
He won't ask any questions once he hears those words.
Shirley Ghetts just called.
Someone want to tell me
why we have Cal's car in the evidence garage?
Oh, boy.
See you in my office, Vince?
He's been in there a long time.
Just try not to think about it.
We got to find a connection between Paddy and Cal.
What'd he say?
He said it's too bad Cal's dead.
He'd like to wrap his hands around his throat.
Frost, what are you doing?
Trying to break Paddy's codes.
He's got these charts starting in 1992.
Show me where that is.
It's right here in Paddy's book.
Oh, my god.
Whoa, what's wrong?
How could we not know? Paddy and Oso -- that's it.
Who's Oso? - Oso Garcia --
He was a Colombian drug dealer that Cavanaugh shut down in '92.
When Paddy was Cavanaugh's C.I.?
Yeah.
'92? That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, why would Paddy buy cocaine from Oso,
then turn around and help Cavanaugh bust him?
Oh, my god.
What is it?
It was a setup from the beginning to the end.
All Paddy wanted was cheaper cocaine,
and he fed Cavanaugh information
knowing that it would chase the Colombians out of southie.
Paddy ran Southie.
Eventually, the Colombians would have to go to him for help.
They didn't know Paddy was the informant.
I'm not following this.
Paddy helped the drug unit bring heat onto Oso
from August of '92 to March of '93.
Oh, so all these zeroes mean Paddy couldn't buy cocaine.
Because Cavanaugh was putting pressure on the colombians.
Right, but in April of '93,
Paddy started buying cocaine again but for half the price.
So what changed in March of '93?
His family died.
Linda and Christopher Cavanaugh
died in the fire at the end of March.
My guess is, Paddy's plan was to kill Cavanaugh,
but it worked out the same when Cal set that fire,
only his wife and son died instead.
'cause Cavanaugh fell apart...
He never ran another drug case.
Does Cavanaugh still have a copy of Paddy's book?
I just saw him leave.
Oh, my god. We got to find him.
He's gonna kill Paddy.
Can I buy you a drink, Sean?
Yeah.
Whoa! Hey! Boston police! Knock it off!
Hey, stop it!
No, no! Come on!
Back off! Back off.
Back off.
I'm gonna kill him.
Try not to move, lieutenant.
How could you?!
He came at me. I was minding my own business.
Oh, shut up! Come on, let's get him up.
I'll get him out of here. Let me take him.
Come on, Sean.
Let me -- let me take you.
He killed my family.
He killed my family.
I still think we need to get him to a hospital.
He needs stitches and his nose reset.
No hospital.
I agree. Let's not make this worse with a paper trail.
You reset my nose. You can do that.
Can you stitch him up, too?
Okay, get me some towels and my medical bag.
Okay..
Let's put him on the couch.
I don't want to get any blood on it.
No, no, it's okay.
As soon as we can move him, I'll take him to my place.
No, I'm fine.
No, you're not.
And if you think I'm gonna
let you try and kill Paddy again, think again.
He's a dead man!
Lieutenant, if anyone deserves to kill him, it's you.
But you can't.
Think about what you had to go through
to survive Linda and Christopher's death.
Every day that you force yourself to go on living
is a tribute to those two people that loved you.
I blamed myself.
All this time, I thought that fire was an accident.
I was right to blame myself. It's my fault that they died.
Don't say that.
Linda and the baby weren't supposed to be there, Vince.
He wanted me, but I was working! I was always working!
So, instead, he killed them.
Get out of my way!
No.
He's not spending another day on earth!
Lieutenant, there's another way.
We keep digging,
we prove that Paddy paid Ghetts to set the fire,
Paddy gets charged with arson, and he gets the death penalty.
You gonna move?
No!
Well, what are you gonna do, Vince?
You gonna shoot me? 'cause that's what it's gonna take.
Oh, what the hell?
I heard you say there was another way.
It's all I could think of.
All she needs to do is check his vitals
and administer the sedative every four hours.
Well, what'd you tell her?
That he's a police officer who lost his family,
and we're looking for the suspect.
That's all she needs to know.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.
What do you need me to do?
He's stable.
I gave him 4 milligrams of lorazepam 15 minutes ago,
and there's more in my kit.
All right. I'll administer another dose in a few hours.
He'll be fine. Go.
Thank you.
We can't keep him on lorazepam for too long.
Well, I'd rather keep him drugged up
than visit him in walpole.
Yes, but I'm concerned about the addiction properties.
Now you're concerned?
Korsak, what's that look like in Cal's garage?
Looks like a welding setup.
Let me see.
Mm, maybe CSRU missed something.
Do you see any signs of welding?
No.
I do.
It has an O.E.M. muffler,
but there's a non-factory weld on it.
Do you want tin snips?
Uh, no, give me the sawzall.
Thanks.
Yeah, I've found something.
Give me that monkey wrench.
Thanks.
And?
And...
Well, Shirley Ghetts said it was their nest egg.
She sure did. This looks promising.
Clever.
It looks like two pieces of pipe and a union joint.
That's a gas valve.
It looks like we found Cal's evidence.
It's a lot better than a missing file.
And these might be pieces from the furnace
that exploded in Cavanaugh's apartment.
He put the arson photos in here.
1245 Silver Street.
That was Cavanaugh's apartment.
Frost isn't back yet?
Give him a break.
His father's an admiral, not a plumber.
Well, did he say that he found anything else in the car?
He said he thought that the exhaust system had been welded shut.
This is the gas valve from the exploded furnace.
If it had malfunctioned, there would be evidence of charring,
there isn't any.
So the gas valve wasn't the cause of the fire,
like Cal originally claimed.
No.
And it wasn't the union joint.
No, there's no damage on the threads.
Which means it was loosened on purpose,
which supports the theory that Cal set the fire.
He probably went into Cavanaugh's apartment,
turned off the heat, then went down into the basement
and loosened the union joint.
Natural gas from these pipes
would have filled the basement in minutes.
Linda came home to a freezing house, turned the heat on.
You know, a fire investigator once told me,
if you smell gas, don't even touch the doorbell.
The electrical spark from that doorbell
is enough to blow the entire place up.
And we still haven't connected the fire to Paddy Doyle.
Got something.
This was stuffed way up in the exhaust pipe.
It's Cal's investigative notes from March 22, 1993 --
that's the day of the fire.
What do they say?
"There was a witness -- a neighbor, Mrs. Longstead"?
She saw Cal?
I don't think it was Cal.
"Francine Longstead of 1299 Winston Street reports
she saw a white male enter the basement right before the fire."
A white male? Cal was black.
"White male" rules out the Colombians, too.
"Mrs. Longstead says she heard the explosion
"and looked out her window in time to see the same man
running from the basement with his shirt on fire."
If his shirt was on fire and he was running,
it's highly likely that
he suffered second- and third-degree burns.
So we just need Mrs. Longstead to make a description.
Francine Longstead died in 2005.
Paddy had nine trusted lieutenants.
One of those guys torched that apartment.
I'm calling up surveillance photos
of Paddy and his top guys from March 1993.
They always met behind the Chauncy Street tavern.
That's Jackie Donovan. We can rule him out.
I didn't see any burn scars when I did his autopsy.
Frost, see if there's a photo of them all together
March 23, 1993.
The day after the fire?
You think they took surveillance photos of him every day?
There's thousands of megs of high-res photos here.
You know, every time Paddy wanted something done,
one of these guys did it, but this time was different.
What do you mean?
Rico -- Paddy's not gonna send
one of his guys to kill a cop's family.
I got it -- March 23, 1993.
He's gonna do it himself.
Of course.
Penalty's the same for capital murder.
Do it yourself, no one can turn on you.
Detective Frost, can you blow up the area around his collar?
Maura, we knew Paddy was behind Linda and Christopher's murders.
That fact that he set the fire himself
isn't any worse than ordering someone else to do it.
What is it?
Hemostatic trauma gauze.
I think she helped him.
Maura, he's fine.
His vitals are stable.
What's wrong?
That's your work, isn't it?
Did Paddy tell you how he got those burns?
No.
You see the man on the couch?
20 years ago,
Paddy killed his 25-year-old wife and their 2-year-old son.
They burned to death after he blew up their apartment,
and you -- you treated his burns, didn't you?
I didn't know.
I swear to you I did not know how he got those burns.
But you must have heard.
You must have heard that a cop's family died in a fire,
and then Paddy shows up with third-degree burns and --
Come on! What lie did you tell yourself that day?!
He swore that he would never hurt women and children,
So that -- it must have been an accident.
No, it wasn't an accident.
There are no more accidents, Hope.
You made a bargain with the devil, and it has come due.
What do you mean?
You're going to testify against him.
I am beyond impressed that you caught
the wildest Hail Mary pass that I ever had to throw.
Thank you both.
Well, it's not over yet.
Hope Martin still has to testify.
What if she doesn't?
Well, that's why I sent two cops to escort her.
She'll be here.
I'll talk to the judge.
We'll get in front of the grand jury,
and we'll have two murder indictments by lunch.
I think you better wish me luck this time.
Don't screw it up, counselor.
You okay?
You know when I said she should've picked
someone else to sleep with 37 years ago?
yeah.
Maybe Paddy should've picked somebody else.
Well, she said she'd testify against him, right?
Yes.
Well, maybe, you know, in her own way,
she's trying to make amends.
Here we go.
Now go get 'em.
How you doing, Jenkins? You got a lot of evidence today.
Got a gun case on the third floor.
Good luck with that, okay?
Thanks.
Cavanaugh should be here.
Lieutenant Cavanaugh? He's already upstairs.
He's what?
Jane, he's not gonna strangle Paddy in the court house.
He can't get his weapon through security.
Yes, he can.
Look at me, you son of a bitch.
Blowin' your head off would be too good.
I'm gonna kill you slowly.
It wasn't personal, Sean. It was just business.
Business?
You killed my wife and my baby son
so you could get your cocaine cheaper?!
How do you stand there and think you deserve another breath?
Sean, don't!
Lieutenant, please don't do this.
Don't. I want to talk to my father.
Don't come any closer, Dr. Isles. He's a dead man.
All right, but before you kill him,
I just want him to know something.
She's here, Paddy -- Hope.
Hope is here?
She was about to testify to the grand jury.
That'll never happen.
Now it won't because the lieutenant is gonna save us all
a lot of anguish,
but it must feel terrible
to hear that the love of your life
was about to help us put you on death row.
She wouldn't.
Oh, but she would.
All these years, you've stayed alive for two things --
power and Hope.
Seems fitting you'd go out like this.
You're lying.
Hope would never do that.
I've got a better way for you to experience hell.
You're gonna stay alive,
but without her.
Come on, Sean.
Give me minute, Vince.
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but these sweet-potato fries are growing on me.
Try them with a fresh mint.
Don't push your luck.
Speaking of luck-pushing,
he totally could have pulled that trigger.
No, he wasn't going to.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
Oh, really? Oh, okay, show me that study.
Cite statistics with your double-blind control group.
What are you doing?
Looking up the peer-reviewed studies
on violence in men's rooms.
You're so full of crap.
You're shoe shopping, m-- stop eating my fries.
Give me my tablet.
No.
Order dessert, and I'll think about it.
Mmm, these are really good with the fresh mint.
Enough with the plants already.
