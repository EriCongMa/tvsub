i took some of jesus &apos;s adhd pills .
why ?
to stay up . to stay focused .
promise me you won &apos;t take any more .
i won &apos;t . i promise .
are you still upset about what i told your dad ?
his moms are blaming him
for everything that happened with callie .
what do they mean everything that happened with callie ?
they had sex .
promise me that you will not hold back on this audition
because you feel that you have an obligation to this girl .
it &apos;s your business if you wanna buy pot for your son ,
but i don &apos;t want him giving any more of it to my brother .
i &apos;m never gonna tell you anything again .
so just stay out of my life .
we have an offer on the house ,
and we &apos;ll have to be out by the end of the month .
there are a couple of
things that we need to talk to you all about .
but first of all , we would like to know who this belongs to .
don &apos;t look at me .
it &apos;s not mine .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a pipe for smoking marijuana .
callie ?
it &apos;s not mine .
okay , well , i found it in one of the boxes in the garage
where you &apos;ve been spending a lot of time lately .
you are welcome to drug test me .
okay .
maybe it belongs to gabe .
no , no way .
okay , there &apos;s something else that we need to tell you .
what ? we made a boatload on the yard sale
and don &apos;t have to move ?
yeah , no thanks to you .
me ?
yeah , you sat on your ass all day .
callie disappeared , like , all day .
hello .
sorry i had to work on my senior project .
which was pretty convenient .
you did nothing .
i did more than anybody .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i had a nail in my head .
mama and i are filing for divorce .
hey . i &apos;m leaving now .
you sure you don &apos;t want a ride to the airport ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure . you sleep .

one of your brood said we could come up .
uh , &quot; we &quot; ?
i &apos;ve got the client
and their contractor here with me .
we spoke yesterday .
uh , yeah , that &apos;s right . we did .
thanks so much .
we &apos;re just in such a time crunch with the baby coming .
i &apos;m sorry . i forogt to tell you .
forgot ?
what we &apos;re thinking is blowing this wall out
and making the bedroom on the other side a master bath .
can we talk , please ?
i think it &apos;s a great idea .
you know , you could make this a walk @-@ in .
oh , i love that .
yeah .
okay , seriously ? seriously ?
we have one week to pack up this entire house , lena .
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
you say no . they &apos;re already rushing us out as it is .
would you stop fighting ?
mariana , will you please take the
give @-@ away box downstairs and put it on the front porch ?
listen , we all have to help , okay ?
okay , we &apos;ll , who &apos;s gonna help me
write a 20 @-@ page paper by monday
and raise $ 5,000 in three weeks for worlds ?
i am also stressed out because right now ,
we have nowhere to live .
i haven &apos;t found the right place yet .
there &apos;s never gonna be a right place , love .
for now , we need a roof over our heads .
hey , would you all mind since she &apos;s got her man here ,
if they just take a quick peek at the kids &apos; bath .
would we mind ? why would we mind ?
okay , terrific .
it &apos;s my soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ husband . what ?
how am i supposed to pay any bills
when you froze our assets ?
honey .
you can keep dragging me back to this house ,
but it &apos;s not getting cheaper .
it &apos;s perfect .
we can &apos;t afford it , lena .
i spoke with my parents ,
and they offered to give me my inheritance now
that we could use for the down payment .
okay , and what about the mortgage ?
we can swing it .
we could swing it , and
then all the kids could have their own rooms .
so , we are adopting the twins ?
well , space wouldn &apos;t be an issue .
yeah , but that &apos;s not the only issue , lena .
it &apos;s our dream house .
can &apos;t you see us here ?
raising our kids and growing old ?
please .
please , please , please , please , please , please , please .
please .
okay .
oh , i love you so much .
i love you too .
okay , i &apos;ll see you at school .
uh , wait .
here . keep it .
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
it &apos;s cool . i want you to .
okay , see you .
you have any garbage ?
what ?
garbage ?
yeah .
you can probably sell this at the yard sale .
whatever .
are you still mad at me about noah ?
jude , i don &apos;t deserve this .
what do you deserve , callie ?
seeing that the only secrets you can keep are your own .
she &apos;s supposed to be the one
that &apos;s in charge of finding us a place to stay .
how hard can that be ?
well , there &apos;s a three @-@ bedroom apartment
in my building for rent .
oh , that would be interesting .
oh , it &apos;s b. it &apos;s b.
hey , buddy . i &apos;m here with your dad ,
and you &apos;re on speaker phone .
hey , b , how was your flight ?
good .
are you in the city ?
yeah , i just came out of the subway .
i &apos;m at , uh , columbus circle .
did you get lost yet ?
no one gets lost anymore , dad . i &apos;ve got my phone .
headed to lincoln center .
i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m checked in and at the dorm .
okay , we &apos;re proud of you , b.
thanks , dad .
love you .
love you too .
your boyfriend is here .
there was other dna on the murder weapon
besides martha johnson &apos;s and kyle &apos;s .
why didn &apos;t kyle &apos;s lawyers ever see this ?
because detective gray didn &apos;t want him to .
he used a private lab that was shut down about a year ago
because of allegations that they doctored reports for the police
to help them with their cases .
hey , how did you get that ?
the lab &apos;s database was subpoenaed in another investigation ,
and i got them to let me take a look .
you &apos;re a genius .
thank you .
if we can place another suspect at martha johnson &apos;s house
on the day she was murdered ,
someone who may have had a motive ,
then we might get a judge to order them to give a dna sample .
like our curb painter .
who &apos;s that ?
there was a guy painting addresses on people &apos;s curbs
without their permission and then harassing them to pay .
so we knocked on some doors .
when was this ?
after we told you to stop harassing people yourself .
we didn &apos;t harass anyone .
callie ...
i &apos;m almost finished with my senior project ,
and you told me i could go through the case file .
but we did tell you to stop playing detective .
we didn &apos;t .
i mean , we did find out where he lives ,
but we didn &apos;t knock on his door .
you know where he lives ?
yeah .
his name is doug harvey .
what if you questioned him ?
if you could get him to admit to painting martha johnson &apos;s curb ,
that might be all we need .
right ?
maybe .
i think i have the wrong room number .
is this 1584 ?
um , yep .
yeah .
this ... this is your room ?
yeah .
okay , i guess they made a mistake then .
you &apos;re auditioning ?
yeah . yeah ,
and they , uh , assigned you as my roommate .
yeah , that happens a lot .
what does ?
my name is ariel , but i go by ari ,
and sometimes , they think i &apos;m a guy .
gotcha . um ...
okay , well , i guess i &apos;ll go tell them .
sorry for the hassle .
no , not your fault .
would you slow down ?
mariana !
sorry .
i can &apos;t believe that nick was hiding up here .
it freaks me out .
i &apos;m definitely not going up in the attic . that &apos;s for sure .
you haven &apos;t gone and seen him again , have you ?
no .
you should just tell him that
you &apos;re not his girlfriend anymore , you know .
i will when he &apos;s better .
he might not get better .
okay , can you stop talking about it , please ?
it &apos;s stressing me out .
what is that ?
it &apos;s mom &apos;s journal .
you mean mama &apos;s journal ?
no . stef &apos;s .
hey , well , you can &apos;t read that .
if someone read my journal , i would die .
wait . you have a journal ?
no .
yeah , you &apos;re right . we shouldn &apos;t be reading this .
okay , well , um ...
all this can go to the yard sale .
well , i &apos;m not supposed to be picking stuff up .
i think you can handle it .
you know , i &apos;m at an increased risk of having a seizure .
hey , we &apos;re supposed to be packing stuff into boxes .
how much of this have you read ?
not much .
yeah , is that why you hid it from me ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
she didn &apos;t want to adopt us . that &apos;s a pretty big deal .
mariana .
you know what ?
i wanna leave this house .
between nick and this ,
all of my good memories are ruined .
so , here .
what am i supposed to do with this ?
burn it , for all i care .
nice place .
the guy could use a gardener .
and a dumpster .
who is it ?
san diego police .
we were hoping that we could talk to you , mr. harvey .
you got a warrant ?
we &apos;re not here to search your home .
you &apos;re on my property . my property is my home .
if you don &apos;t have a warrant , you &apos;re trespassing .
relax . we just want to ask you a few questions .
we understand that you used to paint addresses
on curbs four years ago .
i have a business permit .
0 @-@ 2 @-@ 00 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 @-@ 0 .
0 @-@ 2 @-@ 00 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 @-@ 0 .
take it easy .
yeah . we &apos;re not concerned with that . really . you &apos;re fine .
we , uh , we wanted to know if you knew martha johnson .
who ?
she lived about two blocks from here ,
on penn street .
you may have painted her curb four years ago .
i &apos;ve painted a lot of curbs .
did you paint hers ?
i have no idea .
did you know that she was murdered ?
no .
really ?
because it , you know , happened here in your neighborhood .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t hear about that .
i try to keep to myself .
i don &apos;t really read the papers .
well , you seem to have an awful lot of them .
i pick up stuff .
to recycle .
to organize .
gotcha . makes sense .
all right . well , listen , if you do happen to remember anything ,
this is my card . please , go ahead and call me .
okay ? thank you for your time , mr. harvey .
you have a good day .
i &apos;ll get the door .
okay .
what do you think ?
he &apos;s a nutjob , it doesn &apos;t make him a murderer .
当地少年因杀人被判无期徒刑
so , did you figure out your room situation ?
yeah , i did .
music ?
yeah .
i thought so .
why ?
well , um , you don &apos;t look like a dancer ,
and you don &apos;t act like an actor .
okay . how about you ?
dance .
i would &apos;ve thought drama .
so , are you going out tonight ?
well , i thought i &apos;d check out times square .
times square .
so , this is your first time in new york ?
yeah . why ?
nothing . just don &apos;t take any pictures with anyone in a costume ,
unless you &apos;re willing to pay them .
some of them can get really aggressive .
you know , i might just end up walking around here ...
no . you have to go to times square at least once .
i &apos;m going to a party in midtown .
i can walk with you if you want the company .
sounds like what i need is protection .
i can offer that .
oh , really ? i didn &apos;t know
they had martial arts in the dance program now .
okay . i &apos;m tougher than i look .
hey , i wouldn &apos;t mess with you .
that &apos;s too bad .
you &apos;re so fancy , bringing me here .
on the floor , the fancy rug .
it &apos;s good for your back .
you &apos;re so thoughtful .
what can i say ?
yo , so , uh , what &apos;s the story with this aaron dude ?
what do you mean ?
he ever take you for a ride on his motorcycle ?
seriously .
how &apos;d y &apos;all meet ?
why does it matter ?
the landlord gave me the code to the lockbox ,
so i can show it for him when he &apos;s out of town .
knocks a little off my rent .
wow . looks just like your place .
i think it &apos;s the same exact floor plan ,
except for the extra bedroom .
oh , my god .
i can &apos;t imagine all of us crammed in here ,
living on top of each other .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d let you go month @-@ to @-@ month ,
you know , until you guys find a house .
if we can afford to rent a house .
well , when you make detective ,
that &apos;ll be a big salary bump .
i don &apos;t think brandon will ever move home
if he knows he has to share a room with jesus and jude .
what &apos;s the closet space like ?
i don &apos;t think brandon &apos;s coming home .
what do you mean ?
not as long as callie &apos;s there .
look , stef , i know they had sex ,
and i know that &apos;s why he moved in with cortney .
wait . you cannot blame callie entirely for what happened .
okay ? it &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;m not .
but you have to admit , she &apos;s caused brandon a lot of trouble
from the time she showed up .
and brandon is responsible for his own actions , mike .
i &apos;m not saying he isn &apos;t .
okay , good .
but i think she toyed with him .
i don &apos;t think she meant to ,
but i don &apos;t think she can help herself ,
which is why i &apos;m worried about aj .
i mean , wasn &apos;t he also
her foster brother when they crossed the line ?
and what about this aaron kid ? he &apos;s obviously into her .
is she yanking his chain too ?
okay , okay . that &apos;s enough .
enough . you &apos;re talking about my daughter right now .
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
i just don &apos;t want to see another one of my sons get hurt .
will you please talk to me , callie ?
i met aaron at a coffee shop .
he had a law book .
i thought he looked too young to be in law school .
i told him my name was cameron .
he took me for a ride on his motorcycle .
and we went to the beach .
and he kissed me .
when was this ?
when i was suspended from school .
i also told him i had a boyfriend .
so he does want to date you ?
no , we &apos;re just friends .
i &apos;m not toying with you .
or yanking anyone &apos;s chain .
okay .
what you doing ?
do you think we can take frankie &apos;s tree when we go ?
uh ... yeah .
yeah . i &apos;ll make a call .
hey , uh , we wouldn &apos;t be able to take it where we &apos;re going ,
i mean , at least not right away .
where are we going ?
there &apos;s a three @-@ bedroom apartment for rent at mike &apos;s building .
it &apos;s not huge , but it &apos;s month @-@ to @-@ month , so it &apos;s ...
you already looked at it ?
i did . mike showed it to me .
and i didn &apos;t want to lose it , so i put down a deposit .
without discussing it with me first .
lena , we need some place to go .
so this is how it &apos;s always going to be ?
it &apos;s like we take one step forward and two steps back .
i mean , if nothing is ever going to change between us ,
what is the point ?
so , what do you think ?
i can &apos;t think . it &apos;s like sensory overload .
the one redeeming part is broadway .
i mean , look at all the billboards . you have lion king ,
chicago , hamilton .
this is what i want to do one day .
i want to be on broadway .
looks like i &apos;m going blind .
oh , great . don &apos;t ... don &apos;t look .
the big guys in the costumes , they are , uh ...
yep . what you were saying .
yep .
got it .
so , do you want to see the real new york ?
what about your party ?
honestly , i ... i hate parties .
can we walk ?
mm @-@ hmm . we can walk all you want .
this is a city that never sleeps .
gonna make a basket . literally .
shh ... we have to be quiet .
okay . maybe we should stop talking .
hey , so ...
i &apos;ve never done anything , you know , below the waist .
okay . so ...
everybody has their first time .
don &apos;t .
look , i just ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for that .
um ... okay . sorry .
i should go .
you don &apos;t have to go .
no . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s like , um ...
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
well , i can &apos;t remember the last time i saw a sunrise .
what ?
you better not fall asleep during your audition .
no .
i feel ... great .
everything okay ?
um , i &apos;ve ... got a girlfriend .
ah , back in san diego .
and , uh ...
we sort of live together .
and she has a kid .
she ... has a kid ?
his name is mason .
what are you going to do if you get into juilliard ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know . i ...
i mean , i ... i help support her .
and i pay half the rent .
i watch mason practically every day .
do you even want this ?
do you really , really want this ?
i mean , i want to go to juilliard more than anything .
do you have any idea what it takes to study here ?
everything .
and after every 16 @-@ hour day ,
you have nothing left to give to anybody .
and you shouldn &apos;t have to .
these four years are yours .
i mean , you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t have to be mean .
you have every right to be selfish .
you can &apos;t go into your audition
with a piece of you feeling obligated to fail .
&apos;cause you will .
what do i do , then ? i mean ...
break up with her ?
what , like on the phone ?
yeah .
i ... i don &apos;t think i can do that .
then ... write her a letter .
yeah . put it all down on paper ,
how bad you feel , all of it ,
and then you put a stamp on it and mail it .
you &apos;ll beat it back to san diego ,
and ... then you can do it in person .
right now , you need to do this for yourself .
so ... that way , when you play tomorrow ...
well , today ...
... you &apos;re free .
you &apos;re selling this ?
i gave this to you for your 13th birthday .
it &apos;s a kid &apos;s toy , callie .
okay , look .
i didn &apos;t tell moms about the pot ,
so i did keep your secret .
and if i see someone who i think is a bad influence on you ,
i &apos;m not just going to stand by and watch you screw up .
you don &apos;t know anything about noah .
he &apos;s not a bad influence .
and at least he &apos;s not my foster brother .
okay .
hey , mom . we &apos;re just setting up the yard sale .
can i call you back ?
oh , my god .
excuse me . how much is this ?
it &apos;s a beautiful house . why you selling ?
uh ... downsizing , you know .
huh . you &apos;re selling the art of war . it &apos;s a classic .
how much you want for it ?
i don &apos;t know .
a dollar . does that sound good ?
i &apos;ll give you 50 cents .
sold .
thank you .
i should probably introduce myself .
detective joe gray .
i understand you &apos;re interested in an old case of mine .
oh , yeah ? where &apos;d you get that idea ?
it doesn &apos;t matter where .
i also hear you &apos;re trying to make detective .
the first thing you learn , if you do make it ,
is that we don &apos;t meddle in each other &apos;s cases .
we respect each other . we got each other &apos;s backs .
but then again , that &apos;s if you make detective .
thank you for the heads @-@ up .
no problem .
have a nice yard sale .
i hope you make a killing .
hello ? kyle ...
yeah , slow down . what &apos;s going on ?
hey .
what ?
my mom negotiated a payment plan with the irs ,
and she took a loan against her pension
to pay off the lien .
okay . what does ... what does that mean ?
we don &apos;t have to sell the house .
okay . but ... but we already have .
they &apos;re sending kyle to folsom prison tomorrow .
but he &apos;s not 18 yet .
i know .
listen . do we really need
doug harvey to admit to knowing martha johnson ?
i mean , like , if we somehow got some dna ,
tested it and it was a match .
it wouldn &apos;t be admissible in court .
but would it be enough to get the jjc to take the case ?
if there was another potential suspect ?
maybe . but how do we get his dna ?
hey , i &apos;m getting another call . can i call you back ?
okay . don &apos;t do anything crazy , please .
no , i won &apos;t .
brandon foster ?
here , boy .
hey , hey . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . shh !
good boy . good boy . okay , come on .
come on . come on .
good boy . good boy .
wait . you &apos;re getting a divorce .
now that we have your attention .
we &apos;re not getting a divorce . we are filing for divorce .
why ?
so we can freeze our assets .
the buyer doesn &apos;t want to let us out of escrow .
but if our assets , including this house , are tied up ...
we &apos;re hoping that they &apos;ll walk away .
wow . that &apos;s actually a devious plan . i &apos;m impressed .
we actually got it from our realtor ,
ironically , who is getting divorced .
and we &apos;re not trying to be devious . we &apos;re just ...
just trying to hold on to this home that we love .
how does that sound to you guys ?
amazing .
awesome .
great .
now we have to stay here .
what is going on with her ?
outside of the usual drama , she read your journal .
my journal ?
no . yours .
and what you said in it about mama .
what did you say about me in your journal ?
can i please explain ?
what &apos;s to explain ? you didn &apos;t want us .
that &apos;s not true .
i remember when mom first walked through the door
with the two of you .
you ran right over to me and you leapt into my arms .
you bonded with me instantly ,
and it made me a little uncomfortable .
oh , so you just didn &apos;t want me ?
no . it made me uncomfortable because ...
my own mother was never very affectionate with me .
grandma ?
she softened up over the years , but ...
she just wasn &apos;t nurturing in that way .
and ...
when i looked at you , i saw me as that little girl ...
who yearned for her mom to ...
to hold her and comfort her .
and i guess it scared me a little ,
and it made me sad .
and then one night ,
you had a bad dream .
you woke up crying , and i came into this room ...
and i held you ...
and my heart broke right open .
i felt so much love for you ...
and so much compassion .
and i realized , in that moment that ...
this sweet , sweet little girl ...
was sent to me .
she was sent to me to heal my little girl inside .
and i realized that ...
you were meant to be my daughter ...
and i was meant to be your mother .
adopting you was a gift .
you and your brother have brought me the greatest joy .
and the thing that i &apos;m ...
most proud of in my life is being your mother .
and i &apos;m so sorry that you read what you did .
hey . can i ask you something ?
is there some reason that you don &apos;t want to stay in this house ?
no . i ... i just said that .
you &apos;re sure .
yeah .
so , i &apos;m sorry i was such an ass last night .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s okay .
my moms found your pipe by the way .
damn .
i ... played dumb .
they think it belongs to the guy who worked on the garage .
i &apos;m sorry , man . i ...
look .
i &apos;m sorry too ,
about last night .
you were right . everyone does have a first time ,
and i guess , maybe , i was just ... nervous .
but i still want to if ... you , you know ...
i only want to do what you want to .
what are you doing ?
thinking about our wedding day .
yeah ?
i love you .
i love you too .
i &apos;m sorry that i &apos;ve been taking steps back . i don &apos;t mean to .
hmm . we both are .
we don &apos;t , um ...
we don &apos;t want to get a divorce , you know , for ... for reals ?
sometimes this is hard , but ...
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
are you ?
i &apos;m not crazy .
baby ! what are you doing ?
i just got back in .
how did it go ?
how did it go ? how did you do ?
i killed it .
yeah !
shh ! they &apos;re asleep .
oh , baby , that &apos;s great .
sit down . sit down . i &apos;ll get you a drink of water .
oh my goodness . tell us all about it .
is there someone in the garage ?
