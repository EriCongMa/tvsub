i guess i &apos;m still wondering
if emily and i are right for each other .
does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with ?
you mean the strong , sexy angel i can &apos;t stop thinking about ?
who can say ?
i need to come up with a big idea to make some money .
there &apos;s no reason you can &apos;t .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
you and sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model .
that &apos;s just research .
we &apos;re never going to make any money from it .
forget helium-- the real superfluid
is the fruit punch in this mug .
it reminds me of my daddy &apos;s secret
&quot; don &apos;t tell mama &quot; juice .
maybe that &apos;s an idea .
guidance systems for drunk people .
they have that , it &apos;s called uber .
hey , in your supercooled helium experiments ,
did you create quantum vortices ?
yeah , why ?
well , if you made a guidance system ,
couldn &apos;t you use those vortices as a gyroscope ?
wow . never thought about that .
and , since it &apos;s in a quantum state ,
it would maintain an infinite persistence .
groundbreaking revelations , tropical drinks .
tell me this isn &apos;t like the
best episode of sex and the city .
okay , i gotta ask--
why are you wearing a bow tie ?
i &apos;ve never applied for a patent before .
i wanted to make a good impression .
oh . is the impression that your first name is pee @-@ wee ?
yeah , well , you &apos;re an engineer .
end of joke , burn .
come on in , fellas .
see , he &apos;s not wearing a tie .
well , he &apos;s a patent attorney .
maybe his tie is pending .
so , i &apos;ve reviewed your paperwork ,
and it seems like we &apos;ve got everything we need to file a patent
for your infinite persistence gyroscope .
that &apos;s great !
excellent .
so what happens next ?
well , the legal team needs to review
existing patents to avoid overlap .
oh , i don &apos;t think there will be .
yes , we did our own search .
that &apos;s nice , but i think ours might be a bit more thorough .
get a load of this guy .
can you imagine if we make money with this ?
if we do , i am splurging
on the best sinus irrigator money can buy .
that old sad story--
guy gets a little money , goes straight up his nose .
just need you to review and sign this document
acknowledging that you understand the university
will own 75 % of the patent .
75 % ?
that &apos;s outrageous .
this is our idea based on our research .
how can you possibly justify owning a majority share ?
it &apos;s university policy .
i know when i &apos;m beat .
hold on , hold on . so the three of us
do all the work and only end up with 25 % ?
dr. hofstadter , this university
has been paying your salaries for over ten years .
did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts ?
well , until you just said that mean thing , kinda .
and as far as mr. wolowitz is concerned ,
i &apos;m afraid as a federal employee on loan from nasa ,
your name can be on the patent ,
but you &apos;re not entitled to an ownership share .
wait , so this can turn out to be a financial success ,
and i get nothing ?
well , sometimes they give you a plaque .
well , that &apos;s not fair .
we should all get plaques .
sorry , but we can &apos;t sign this .
come on , let &apos;s go .
thank you for your time .
couple of questions about the plaque ...
so , have you been having any morning sickness ?
a little .
and it doesn &apos;t help that i &apos;ve got this heightened sense of smell .
is that a pregnancy thing ?
yeah .
the other day i sniffed out
where howie hid the girl scout cookies .
no more tagalongs , my ass .
but now you &apos;ll be able to make
your own milk to eat the cookies with .
hey , guys . hey , penny .
i really appreciate you helping me with this .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
oh , sure . let me see it .
see what ?
i hadn &apos;t spoken to emily since i broke up with her ,
and she left this on my doorstep with a note .
&quot; raj , i got you this before we split up , but couldn &apos;t return it
and thought you &apos;d like to have it .
happy belated valentine &apos;s day , emily . &quot;
that &apos;s nice .
nice , or is she trying to manipulate him ?
i know . i mean , do i open it ? do i return it ?
why wouldn &apos;t you open it ?
well , she was pretty mad .
for all i know it &apos;s a voodoo doll of me
with a fork stuck in my junk .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d actually send you something
gross or dangerous , do you ?
i know one way to find out-- sniff this .
she &apos;s pregnant , she &apos;s not a bloodhound .
although i am getting a little machine oil .
i think it &apos;s metal .
come on , just open it .
you know , on game of thrones ,
balon greyjoy received his son &apos;s genitals in a box .
well , never hurts to have a spare .
what is that ?
it &apos;s an antique sextant .
sailors used these to find their position by the stars .
what a nice gift for an astrophysicist .
i know , she &apos;s so thoughtful .
see , she &apos;s trying to get you back .
now , that is exactly what i would &apos;ve gotten you
if i had any idea what it is or what you do .
you know , i have too much self @-@ esteem to let this girl
guilt me into getting back together with her .
you don &apos;t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap .
well , what if we go around the university
and just get the patent ourselves ?
we can &apos;t . it says on their web site ,
as long as we work there , they have a controlling ownership
of anything we come up with .
great , so they own my idea for a t @-@ shirt
that says &quot; dumb as a bag of geologists . &quot;
well , our choices are we do this with the university
or we don &apos;t do it at all .
either way , i get nothing .
or , if we ended up making money from this ,
sheldon and i could split our shares with you .
to be clear ,
leonard is referring to the gyroscope ,
not the t @-@ shirt and mugs .
oh ! now they own the mugs .
i guess that is a way around this .
you guys would be cool doing it like that ?
of course , we can split any profits three ways .
i &apos;m fine with that .
okay , great .
it sounds like a , uh , contract might be in order .
sure , we could write something up .
but which one of us should be the party who ...
you can do it , sheldon .
so stipulated !
once i found a stash of contracts under his bed .
it was weird .
i wonder how much she spent on this .
ooh , let &apos;s find out .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s the thought that counts .
yeah , yeah , and beauty &apos;s on the inside ,
size doesn &apos;t matter-- how much she spend ?
seriously , guys , i don &apos;t want to know .
oh , my .
oh , come on , you can &apos;t say &quot; oh , my , &quot; and then not tell me !
these things go for $ 500 and up .
damn .
all i got for valentine &apos;s day was a postcard
saying my vermont teddy bear was back @-@ ordered .
okay , so , she drops off a $ 500 gift
and she &apos;s not trying to get back together with you ?
maybe you &apos;re right .
or she &apos;s telling the truth and just being nice .
maybe you &apos;re right .
wow , i am easy to manipulate .
oh , guys , it &apos;s emily .
what should i do ?
okay , answer it . just be strong .
and if she starts to cry , don &apos;t make any promises .
and most importantly , put it on speaker so we can hear .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s emily .
is this a good time ?
yeah , yeah . sure . what &apos;s up ?
was it okay i left that gift ?
i &apos;m really hoping we can be friends .
maybe , maybe .
um , you think you &apos;d want to grab a cup of coffee ?
hello ?
i &apos;m sorry , i seem to be taking an annoying amount of time
deciding how i feel about this !
i just ... i miss hanging out with you .
it &apos;s not like i lost a friend ,
it &apos;s like i lost my best friend .
is there any chance you &apos;d want to come over ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
okay . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m having a really hard time ,
but that &apos;s not your problem , that &apos;s mine .
i @-@ i won &apos;t bother you again ,
but please know that you &apos;ll always have a place in my heart .
bye , raj .
you &apos;re a good guy .
good @-@ bye , emily .
that was rough , you guys .
i know , but you did it . i &apos;m so proud of you .
well , anyway , i &apos;ll leave you to your girls &apos; night .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to stay here with us ?
no , i kind of feel like being alone right now .
well , if you change your mind , we &apos;ll be here .
thank you .
say hi to emily for us .
will do .
this contract looks good to me .
i &apos;ll say it looks good .
it &apos;s in my proprietary font , shelvetica .
i want to say something obnoxious ,
but it is easy on the eyes .
i &apos;m a little tired , howie . you ready to go ?
yeah , one sec . i just need to sign this contract .
what is it ?
well , we ran into a problem about my share of the patent ,
so we &apos;re forming a partnership
to split anything we make equally .
sheldon , did you draft the contract ?
you bet i did .
you &apos;re gonna make out so hard tonight .
so , you &apos;re just gonna sign this
without having a lawyer look at it ?
excuse me .
i &apos;ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten .
didn &apos;t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting .
don &apos;t need one now .
i know , but ...
bernie , the guys were nice enough to find a way
to keep me from being cut out .
well , i should hope so .
the whole thing was your idea .
well , to be fair , howard &apos;s idea was based on sheldon &apos;s math .
guys , everyone is involved in this , okay ?
howard &apos;s invention ,
sheldon &apos;s math , my original theory
that space @-@ time was like a supercooled liquid .
which i &apos;m sure penny would &apos;ve mentioned
if she wasn &apos;t working on that hangnail right now .
what ?
honey , this is fine .
if you want to sign a contract that sheldon whipped up ,
go ahead .
can i talk to you in the hall ?
sure .
excuse us .
hey , leonard .
what ?
if she doesn &apos;t think that we should apply for this patent ,
she &apos;s being patently absurd .
good one .
okay , you got it .
see , i was afraid it was a thinker .
what are you doing ?
i just want to make sure you &apos;ve thought this through .
what &apos;s to think about ? we have an invention
and want to move forward .
howie , you &apos;re about to form a legal partnership
with sheldon cooper .
all right , if you &apos;re gonna calmly make excellent points ,
then i don &apos;t know if i want to talk to you .
okay . i get it .
and it &apos;s sweet that you &apos;re worried about me ,
but i can take care of myself .
i &apos;m not worried about you . i &apos;m worried about me .
i don &apos;t want to go through this pregnancy listening
to you complain about sheldon driving you crazy
more than you already do .
here we go with the ironclad logic again .
you &apos;ve tried to work with him before .
it hasn &apos;t gone well .
why is this time gonna be any different ?
is the fetus helping you ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s cheating .
hello ?
hey , raj .
it &apos;s claire . how are you ?
hi . i &apos;m good . really good .
well , i don &apos;t know why i said &quot; really good . &quot;
i &apos;m just regular good .
i really just wanted to sound confident .
and that &quot; really &quot; was a real &quot; really , &quot;
not a fake &quot; really &quot; like the first &quot; really . &quot;
really ?
i don &apos;t know . i lost track and i missed my exit .
so , uh ... so what &apos;s up ?
well , last time we talked ,
i had just gotten back together with my boyfriend ,
and i wanted to let you know that things didn &apos;t work out .
really ? i &apos;m sorry .
i swear i know other words .
so if you were still interested ...
yes ! indeed ! absolutely ! indubitably !
i &apos;m not even sure what the last one means ,
but it &apos;s another word , and i know it .
so , uh , when do you want to meet up ?
uh , i &apos;m almost off work .
what are you doing now ?
r @-@ right now , well ...
well , actually , to @-@ to be completely honest ,
i &apos;m stopping by to see my ex @-@ girlfriend
because she &apos;s having a tough time . but ...
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re getting back together or anything .
let me guess , the worst part about breaking up
is that she doesn &apos;t have her best friend to talk to anymore ?
that &apos;s exactly what she said !
how do you know that ?
i &apos;m a girl .
it &apos;s , like , page one out of the playbook .
any chance you could send me a pdf of that playbook ?
they &apos;ve been out there a while .
i hope everything &apos;s okay .
i wonder what they &apos;re talking about .
if you guys would shut up , i could tell you .
be cool , be cool , be cool .
hey . you guys all right ?
yeah . but , um , we were talking ,
and ... i &apos;m a little concerned
about the three of us forming a partnership .
are you suggesting a limited liability corporation ?
&apos;cause i did not l @-@ l @-@ see that coming .
sheldon , my concern is not with the money or anything .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s with how you treat me .
well , i believe i &apos;m treating you generously .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve stipulated in the contract
that your contributions to our invention
are as valuable as my own .
are you saying that his contributions aren &apos;t as valuable as yours ?
no , i am not saying that ,
because i kept saying that this morning
and leonard said , &quot; stop saying that . &quot;
see ? this is what happens every time we work together .
you know what , hang on .
what if sheldon had no choice
but to be respectful ?
is there a switch on the back of his neck
we don &apos;t know about ?
no .
what i &apos;m saying is you could add a clause to the contract
that he can &apos;t make fun of howard .
how would you enforce it ?
oh , please . any contract i sign
is enforced by my own personal code of ethics .
and his obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder .
yeah , that , too .
and scoot over .
part of your shadow &apos;s on my spot .
howard , what do you think ?
i &apos;m on board .
i &apos;ll add it right now .
oh , baby , it &apos;s addendum time !
hello ?
hey , emily , listen ,
i &apos;ve been thinking , and i &apos;m not sure
it &apos;s a good idea that i come over .
okay . i understand .
no , no . please don &apos;t cry .
okay , i &apos;ll stop !
hello ?
hey , so , listen , claire , change of plans ...
fine . do what you want , but she &apos;s playing you .
i don &apos;t think so . she sounded pretty upset .
you mean like ...
&quot; i was just really looking forward to seeing you .
i &apos;m having such a rough day . &quot;
emily , listen ...
i &apos;m sorry ,
but i can &apos;t come by .
why not ?
i think we both know if i come over ,
we &apos;re gonna get back together and ...
i told you i needed a friend .
what do you think is happening here ?
call you right back .
the @-@ the revisions i made start on page four .
wow . that is a lot of &quot; whereupons . &quot;
you should see the valentine &apos;s day card he gave me .
&quot; article three : as it pertains to this project ,
dr. sheldon cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or
disrespectful language
directed toward howard wolowitz ,
including but not limited to : mockery of engineering ,
his height , his hair , his wardrobe ,
and his insane belief that the ghost rider movie
was , quote , &apos; not that bad . &apos; &quot;
hang on . maybe there should be
a &quot; no insult &quot; clause about me , too .
do you still like cilantro ?
yeah .
you &apos;re tying my hands here .
all right , let &apos;s sign this .
wait , wait , wait .
what are these changes on page six ?
sheldon , what did you do ?
i should &apos;ve known .
&quot; 25 % of profits
&quot; due to sheldon cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund
for the firstborn child of howard and bernadette wolowitz . &quot;
sheldon , that &apos;s so nice .
that beats the onesie i was gonna get them from baby gap .
that &apos;s very generous , sheldon .
oh , i &apos;ve always valued education over money .
and the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect
made me realize how dismissive
i &apos;ve been of your contributions .
i appreciate that .
and i just hope
that this scholarship can rescue your child
from the subpar education
and menial life of an engineer .
sheldon .
what ?
i didn &apos;t sign it yet .
i hear what you &apos;re saying ,
but i &apos;ve known emily a long time ,
and i think she deserves the benefit of the doubt .
all right , it &apos;s your life .
but you know how this is gonna end .
as a matter of fact , i do .
i &apos;m gonna comfort her ,
because i &apos;m a caring and decent friend
who &apos;s happy to be there
when she needs someone to talk to .
good talk .
