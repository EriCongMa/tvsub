... walking around their tank , holding claws , like ....
you have to picture lobsters .
hey , you feeling better ?
yeah , i think that fifth shower got the interview off me .
do you have other possibilities ?
there is the possibility that i won &apos;t make rent .
if you want , i can lend you money .
if i couldn &apos;t pay you back right away , i &apos;d feel guilty and tense around you .
then why not borrow it from mom and dad ?
you feel guilty and tense around them already .
might as well make some money off of them .
the man &apos;s got a point .
