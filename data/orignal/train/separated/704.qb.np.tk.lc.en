i have nowhere to go .
darling , there &apos;s really nothing i can do to help you now .
i have no resources .
do you work in finance ?
a little bit .
how much do you hate it
when people ask you for free advice ?
conrad laid waste to our family assets .
let me help .
call it a loan ?
i like to get out and clear my head .
should you ever want any company ...
david , meet your daughter .
do it . shoot .
end this whole thing right now .
i owe you so much more than a quick death .
what did she want ?
charlotte .
i thought it ... that it was you that she was after .
emily wants to destroy our whole family .
emily !
who was that ? what did you see ?
guy in sweatshirt with a knife .
i barely saw his face .
do you see him ?
no .
the system was mid @-@ reboot . most of the cameras were down .
thank god i heard the motion detectors .
you could &apos;ve been killed .
i &apos;m okay , nolan .
barely .
ems , there was a man in your room
with a knife ,
and he was not after your stash of vintage cartier .
he wanted blood .
wait ...
do you think this is what victoria had planned ?
that would explain why she didn &apos;t shoot me
when she had the chance .
of course she &apos;d hire someone else to do her dirty work .
at least he failed .
yeah . well , it &apos;s my move now .
no , no , no , no .
no more moves .
i say we tag out . let &apos;s call the police .
the police ? no .
all right . then at least let &apos;s call jack .
he &apos;s police adjacent .
&apos;cause i am over this war with you and victoria .
nolan , we don &apos;t call the police .
why not ?
oh , because maybe
the henchman wasn &apos;t working for victoria alone .
maybe little arson annie was behind this , too .
she &apos;s not my sister .
i promised to help charlotte .
i &apos;m not going to sic the cops on her .
oh , what ? so she gets another spin on the murder wheel ?
how many ?
i &apos;m going to search the property .
you do know that that hoodie is not a bulletproof vest ,
that you can die ,
and that the girl that you are so desperately trying to save
would like to see that happen sooner rather than later ?
yes , you made choices that hurt charlotte ,
and , no , you can &apos;t undo them ,
but you don &apos;t have to repay her with your life .
i &apos;m not gonna turn my back on her again .
no cops .
david ?
david !
charlotte ?
you scared me .
you &apos;re hurt .
what happened ?
the hood of your car is still warm .
did you just get in ?
yes .
it was too late to drive here ,
so i took a suite in the city .
so , y @-@ you got some money ?
enough to last us for a while .
where &apos;s charlotte ?
i don &apos;t know .
david , you were supposed to stay here last night to protect her .
i tried to .
i snuck into emily thorne &apos;s house last night .
what ?
david , what did you do ?
did you kill her ?
i came close ...
but i couldn &apos;t .
did she see you ?
no .
did anyone ?
no .
are you sure ?
no one saw me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i ... i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
but this is a different world from the one that you left .
your re @-@ emergence must be carefully planned ,
and you &apos;ll need an alibi for the night of conrad &apos;s death .
if you come out now ,
they &apos;ll expect an explanation for where you &apos;ve been .
do you have one ?
david .
all i want is the life you promised me years ago ,
but we mustn &apos;t rush it .
let me take care of things .
yeah .
you &apos;re right .
yeah , i &apos;m not thinking clearly .
get some rest , my love .
ems ?
um , got a sec ?
i was just heading out .
another walk in the woods ?
nolan reported a break @-@ in last night .
why didn &apos;t you call ?
look , the alarm was off and someone got in ,
but he didn &apos;t take anything , nolan ran him off .
it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
you know i like my privacy .
except that the , intruder had a knife , ems .
well , that escalates this
from breaking and entering to aggravated assault .
so , we &apos;re gonna need a statement .
humor us ,
since i &apos;ve already got my pad out .
just let them know i &apos;m not here .
they can reach me on my cell if they really want to ,
but , i don &apos;t need to have this .
okay .
morning .
daniel .
merci .
i thought we were meeting later at your place .
yeah , well , my place isn &apos;t exactly my place anymore .
the ripley &apos;s too expensive for me right now .
the truth is , my family &apos;s assets are depleted .
daniel ...
and before you offer ,
i &apos;ll be okay , all right ?
i &apos;m a grayson , i &apos;ve survived worse .
i know you will .
but i need to tell you
that your mother came to see me last night .
she already told you about our financial situation .
what did she want ?
a loan .
i &apos;m sorry she put you in such an awkward position .
awkward ?
well , i truly believe my father loved her .
besides , now she owes me .
now , that &apos;s a hell of a card to have in your hand .
how do you say &quot; badass &quot; in french ?
i &apos;m not sure if i qualify .
i may have handled your mother ,
but the quarterly earnings are down again .
well , i can take a look at the numbers if you want .
it &apos;s a content issue . that &apos;s what drives the numbers .
and the editorial department is lacking , so ...
hey , you shouldn &apos;t be worrying about me today .
what time is your meeting with ...
louise ellis ?
yes .
at noon .
after drinks last night , i was up for hours
coming up with a strategy to expand her portfolio .
i mean , managing a member of one of the south &apos;s most prominent families
would be the perfect start for my wealth @-@ management firm .
well , this louise would be a fool not to hire you .
you can be very charming .
i hope so .
i feel like i &apos;m starting my life over from scratch .
i really need this to work .
then make it work .
because that &apos;s what we do .
damn right .
so , you woke up when you heard mr. ross yell your name .
and you saw the intruder , white male , medium build ,
standing over you with a knife .
now , did you get a look at his face ?
i could barely make out anything
before he jumped off the balcony .
that &apos;s got to be a 15 @-@ foot drop at least .
my guess is , the guy hurt himself .
do you mind if i take a look at the jump site ?
i &apos;ll do the honors , officer hunter .
it &apos;s right this way .
emily ...
don &apos;t , jack .
i &apos;m not involving you any more
than nolan already has .
so i &apos;m right to suspect that there &apos;s more here ,
and , what , i &apos;m supposed to just back off ?
it was a simple break @-@ in .
look , the fire was one thing .
i let you stand by your statement to protect charlotte .
but if ... if this is what i think it is ,
it &apos;s murder for hire .
are you done making your statement ?
charlotte is out of your control .
you can &apos;t make the people you love change ,
even if it &apos;s for their own good .
now , if this thing is tied to victoria
and if we can find the intruder ,
we can take her down legitimately
and maybe even save charlotte .
but what you &apos;re doing to help her ,
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not working , and you &apos;re in danger .
jack ...
can you please just let me do my job ?
i can &apos;t stop you .
no , you can &apos;t .
and , emily ...
if victoria turns up hurt
or worse ...
i will arrest you .
my super needs to be fired .
i spoke to dr. hicks .
you polished off an old prescription of my xanax
and then had it refilled .
why are you going down this ugly road again ?
are you seriously asking me that ?
we have all been to hell and back .
yeah , mine was a one @-@ way trip .
i just found out emily is amanda and my father is alive .
exactly , he is alive ,
and your reaction is to hide behind a haze of pills .
no . my reaction was happiness .
but you ruined that
and made meeting my father all about hurting emily .
what do you really want from me , mom ?
nothing but to see you happy .
the grayson mantra : lie and deny .
i &apos;m sick of it .
i do want a relationship with my father ,
but not if you &apos;re gonna be controlling it .
you are not a victim , so stop choosing to act like one .
now , if you want a relationship with your father , fight for it .
and if you want my respect , then earn it .
but do not give in to the darkness
that will destroy you .
i mean , first the fire and then this ?
what did she do , walk under a ladder and break a mirror ?
you never mentioned that you ran into emily yesterday .
yeah . out by the old windmill site .
she said she was out for a walk .
she didn &apos;t seem too happy to see me then , either .
does she hate cops or something ?
no , just , uh , it takes a lot for her to ask for help .
so , let &apos;s not make her ask
i &apos;ll have a couple black and whites drive by today .
for peace of mind .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re planning on driving one of them .
are you gonna tell me that you &apos;re not trying to impress emily ?
dude , you &apos;re way off .
if i wanted to ask emily out , i &apos;d ask her out .
but i &apos;m starting to feel like you &apos;d have a problem with that .
listen , man . i &apos;m just trying to uncomplicate things with her .
that &apos;s all you had to say .
all right . message received .
loud and clear .
may i help you ?
no . sorry .
i saw that .
what ?
stay down .
let me go .
you &apos;re under arrest .
yeah . this should do it .
thank you .
hey , townsend , who &apos;s the perp ?
some &quot; john doe &quot; keller and i picked up .
misdemeanor shoplifting .
and he was two seconds away from adding resisting arrest .
yeah . you know how he got the limp ?
nope . looks like it &apos;s the one thing
he brought into the store with him .
so , no weapons ?
or i.d.
we still have to run his prints through the national database .
looks like a guy with a record a mile long .
that &apos;s called profiling , you know ?
well , who died and made you a liberal ?
hey , you &apos;ve called emily . leave a message .
yeah , emily , it &apos;s ben .
if you have time , come down to the station .
i think we may have something .
may i sit ?
does my answer matter ?
has it ever ?
yes .
what you and charlotte think matters to me .
for all the mothering i thought i &apos;d done ,
i failed you both ,
and i &apos;m going to spend the rest of my life trying to remedy that .
but for now ...
please allow me to offer some financial support .
where &apos;d you get this ?
well , as i told you ,
your father was a master at hiding assets , so ...
that should be enough to keep you and charlotte afloat for a while .
well , as long as margaux doesn &apos;t make you repay it .
man , you come with open arms and nothing but lies .
margaux was kind enough to offer .
we &apos;re practically family .
yeah , but you &apos;re not .
finally , the silver lining in pascal &apos;s death .
oh , you &apos;re being cruel ,
and if we were not in such a public place ,
i would smack your mouth .
you will not speak ill of pascal again .
like you said ,
i &apos;m the patriarch of this family ,
i &apos;ll say what i want .
do me a favor ,
stay away from margaux , and stay away from charlotte .
as for me , well , it should be clear .
mrs. grayson ...
latour 1928 for you from a secret admirer .
no , thanks .
i was just leaving .
i &apos;m sorry , ms. ellis , but mrs. grayson declined .
well , did you tell her it was latour 1928 ?
as you requested .
this was a stupid idea !
the gesture was lovely .
a glass from a $ 20,000 bottle of champs
is more than lovely , dear .
you enjoy it .
thanks .
well , who needs champagne ?
at no point during the lineup
are you to attempt communication of any kind with anyone .
step forward only when your number is called .
are we clear ?
head up , number three .
david .
file them out .
you okay , porter ?
yeah .
yeah , no , i just finished , uh , prepping the lineup .
now i got to ... i got to go .
you need to get this one right .
a break @-@ in at the grayson manor will set off panic alarms ,
and the last thing we need is a rash of unsolved home invasions .
right . yes , sir .
you took the initial statement , correct ?
yes . um , yeah .
take a minute . fill me in .
yeah , let me call you back .
hi . i &apos;m glad you could make it .
i left word for mr. ross , as well .
you &apos;re the first to arrive .
you guys work fast .
well , a guy matching your description
came in on another case .
he even had a leg injury .
so , we thought it was worth a look .
so , you were just lucky ?
or incredibly skillful .
look , if we do find the intruder ,
could you please tell your partner
to call off the squad car parked outside of my house ?
well , i could , but i sent it .
look . i know you &apos;re no damsel in distress , all right ?
i was just trying to give you
some peace of mind after a traumatic night .
well , thank you , but i --
yeah , i know --
you can take care of yourself .
i keep forgetting that you were in juvie .
we &apos;re following up with mr. ross and ms. thorne --
ms. thorne .
chief alvarez .
we &apos;ve actually met .
right , at my wedding . victoria invited you .
well , i &apos;ll let you get to it .
trust me , you &apos;re in capable hands .
thanks , chief .
thanks .
so , we good ?
ben , i need to speak with emily for a minute .
alone .
what , are you forgetting protocol ?
you prepped the lineup ,
you can &apos;t speak to the witness in private .
a first @-@ year law student would have that i.d. tossed at trial .
come on . you talk to her after .
all right . bring them out .
now , emily , i know you only caught a glimpse .
just -- just take your time .
number three .
number three , step forward .
em .
there &apos;s no reason to be intimidated .
all right ? he can &apos;t see you .
i know .
are you ready to make an i.d. ?
no .
it &apos;s not him .
just take your time .
i &apos;m sure .
i don &apos;t recognize anyone .
you still checking out my portfolio ?
you can afford to take some more risks .
your buys have been way too conservative .
says the guy in a suit at a pool .
come on . it &apos;s summer , it &apos;s hot as hellfire .
don &apos;t you want to get in and cool off ,
then we can talk some business ?
i &apos;d rather talk about increasing your return .
i could give you some quick fixes ,
but you need a more comprehensive overhaul .
trust me .
and why should i trust you ?
i don &apos;t know anything about you --
except for your last name .
well , don &apos;t hold that against me .
tabloids print lies .
mm . my brother &apos;s in politics --
i &apos;m aware of how papers are sold .
it &apos;s all lies and sex .
why don &apos;t you tell me something about yourself ?
something personal , like , um ...
tell me about your mother .
says a lot about a man &apos;s character ,
how he gets along with his mama .
well , we don &apos;t have the best relationship .
why ?
short answer --
she meddles .
well , at least she cares .
i wasn &apos;t even worth meddling to my mother .
i went never good enough , smart enough , or pretty enough .
one time , when i was 14,
i put a &quot; hex &quot; on her to make her love me .
did it work ?
oh , no , darlin &apos; .
nothing can fix the devil .
my mama and i , we &apos;ll never mend things ,
but ...
i &apos;d give anything to start over with a great mom , you know ?
well , maybe we &apos;re better off .
so , tell me --
what does your mama meddle with ?
that &apos;s a story for another day .
but you can trust me , okay ?
i want to make you a lot of money , louise .
the question is , what do you want ?
tell you what --
how about i test your nasdaq picks while you help me out ?
i need to know you have my back .
hey , i just got ben &apos;s message .
what &apos;s is happening ? what is going on ?
ems ?
em ?
babe , you &apos;re freaking me out .
what happened ?
ems ?
my father ...
he &apos;s alive .
what -- what are you talking about ?
i just saw him in the lineup .
but ...
no , no , no . no , no .
i swear to god , nolan . it was him !
no ...
how is this possible ?
after everything i ...
it was him , nolan --
in my house last night . it had to have been .
but why -- why would he break into my house ?
why would he want to hurt me ?
i don &apos;t know . i -- i don &apos;t know .
em .
what the hell , man ? is this real ?
it is .
his fingerprints just came back from the d.o.j.
he was arrested on the edge of town .
he was bruised and disoriented .
jack ...
please . i need to see him .
i &apos;ll find a way .
okay .
what is this about , edward ?
i &apos;m sorry to have brought you in here like this , victoria .
i heard you were back in the city ,
so i had the nypd on the lookout .
well , your officers sneak me through the back entrance .
am i in trouble ?
no . no , not at all .
given our long history ,
i thought a face @-@ to @-@ face might be best ...
before the story breaks .
maybe you should have a seat .
my officers arrested a man today
whose prints came back as those of david clarke .
i know this must be shocking to you , to say the least .
your head must be spinning with a thousand questions ,
but trust me , we &apos;ll get answers .
what did he say ? where has he been ?
well , unfortunately , mr. clarke isn &apos;t speaking ,
but the investigation as to his whereabouts these past years is under way ,
as well as a possible connection
to a break @-@ in in your former residence .
now , listen , victoria .
i don &apos;t want to frighten you ,
but you may have been the intended victim .
i &apos;m sorry .
th @-@ this is all a bit much .
could i ...
could i have a moment alone , please ?
sure .
i &apos;ll get you some water .
do you know what you &apos;re gonna say to your father ?
no .
it &apos;s too late .
no , it &apos;s not .
you cleared his name , he is a free man ,
they cannot hold him .
they can if he escaped from prison ,
if he faked his own death .
and what about last night ?
ems , no !
sorry . the precinct &apos;s shutting down . no visitors .
i @-@ i &apos;m not a visitor .
i &apos;m , i &apos;m here to see officer porter .
ma &apos;am , do we have a problem ?
well , i guess the news is out about david clarke .
ms. thorne here was one of the first to see him in a lineup .
i just want answers .
officer , escort her out of here .
look . i know you want to get it here and see him for your friend .
i &apos;m starting to think
it &apos;s what kept you from making an i.d. earlier .
all right , we have to let the feds handle this ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do right now except wait ,
so just go home , please .
amanda wouldn &apos;t want me to .
ems ...
it &apos;s time to go .
let &apos;s go home .
please .
please .
louise sent over a nice little retainer
into my account this afternoon ,
so i am back in business and back in the penthouse .
the concierge even sent up some champagne to welcome me back .
you can be very persuasive .
well , i may need you
to help me woo a few award @-@ winning journalists
over to lemarchal .
ah , you &apos;re a rockstar , babe . you don &apos;t need my help .
i want to hear about everything .
what about louise ? what is she like ?
how about you swing by later for dinner ?
i &apos;ll tell you all about it .
i would love that .
until then .
all right .
louise .
i thought we were done for the day .
oh , we are .
i saw you check in earlier .
i &apos;m in penthouse a , remember ?
right . right .
and i thought
we might be able to celebrate our new partnership in person .
it &apos;s latour 1928 .
my mother loves the stuff .
d @-@ did you send over a glass to my mom earlier ?
no , why ?
it &apos;s just that , uh , that &apos;s her favorite , too .
oh , well ...
you know , they say ,
&quot; coincidence is god &apos;s way of staying anonymous . &quot;
and meeting you was definitely divine intervention .
now , i know this sounds hippy dippy and all ,
but i swear if you just ask the universe for something ,
most of the time , it will just land right in your lap .
well , i &apos;ll remember that .
oh , before i forget , i have one more thing for you .
close your eyes .
do it .
okay . open .
rule number one --
no more suits .
rule number two --
if we &apos;re going to be working together ,
i &apos;m gonna need you to squeeze in a little play time .
maybe by the pool ?
unless ...
you have a problem with that ?
not at all .
great !
and to think i almost didn &apos;t walk into that bar last night .
well , okay .
you enjoy your champagne .
toodles .
toodles .
mr. clarke ...
i &apos;m agent stiegel with the federal bureau of investigation .
this interview is being recorded .
do you understand ?
i &apos;m susan luke .
i &apos;ve been retained to represent mr. clarke .
retained by whom ?
victoria .
get her out of here . now .
actually , i &apos;d like you all to clear the room .
mr. clarke has the right
to confer with counsel .
i don &apos;t need that .
mr. clarke -- - i just want to tell the truth .
it &apos;s all i have left .
i &apos;m not a terrorist .
i was framed ...
and taken from my daughter .
i was stabbed in prison ,
but i didn &apos;t die .
conrad grayson -- he faked my death ,
and then he locked me away for years .
i was tortured .
i ...
please continue , mr. clarke .
conrad , he paid guards
just to crush any hope that i had left .
i saw a chance to run . i took it .
and that &apos;s when i was arrested .
but i know that ...
conrad will -- will find me .
he &apos;ll kill me .
mr. clarke , conrad grayson cannot hurt you .
he &apos;s evil . you don &apos;t understand .
david , conrad is dead .
he was killed six months ago .
before he died , he admitted ...
to framing you .
your name has been cleared .
now , mr. clarke ,
we &apos;re gonna need you to lead us to where mr. grayson kept you .
yeah .
can you do that ?
y @-@ yeah . yeah .
yeah . i think i can .
i &apos;d like to request that mr. clarke be released .
the government will need to vet his version of events .
of course .
but i assure you
that mr. clarke is not a flight risk .
this is a broken and frightened man
who will cooperate with this investigation .
please , let him come home ...
with me .
are they reporting anything yet ?
no .
listen ...
after i lost my dad ...
all i ever wished for was just to see him one more time .
i &apos;d settle for five minutes ...
one more kiss good night .
your wish came true .
god , i can &apos;t wrap my head around any of this .
ems . look .
we join chief edward alvarez now .
do you have david clarke in custody ?
it is true that david clarke is alive .
in his first statement ,
mr. clarke reports that he was held by conrad grayson ,
beaten and tortured for 10 years .
although his assertion is still subject to confirmation ,
the fbi has decided to release david clarke on good faith .
after this 20 @-@ year ordeal ,
david clarke is finally a free man .
he &apos;s expected to make a public statement within the next hour .
my god .
that &apos;s it . no questions . thank you .
i knew conrad was evil , but this ...
i should have killed him myself .
ems , breathe .
i &apos;m going down there .
i need to see my dad tonight .
i know you want to , but not like this .
ems , not in public .
you both deserve so much more .
we deserved more 20 years ago .
i can &apos;t wait one more day .
charlotte &apos;s on her way down . she &apos;s worried sick .
the way the news is reporting this ,
they assume you &apos;re fragile .
i &apos;m not .
i know .
in that interrogation room ,
i remembered the man i fell in love with --
smart , a risk taker ,
a man who was willing to go to any lengths
to do what you did today ,
to finally reveal what happened to him .
david ...
you know you can tell me anything .
when i was locked away ,
i analyzed everything ...
even you .
do you remember how i wanted us to leave
weeks before i was arrested for flight 197
and you said , &quot; let me take care of things &quot; ?
this morning , you said the same thing .
i won &apos;t be anyone &apos;s prisoner anymore ...
not even yours , victoria .
you grabbed me , and i stayed .
i never held you hostage .
i was trying to keep you safe .
you had six months of unaccounted @-@ for time ,
and i am never going to let you go down for conrad &apos;s death .
that &apos;s why i retained a lawyer --
a better lawyer than you and i can afford .
i did it for you .
for us .
mr. clarke , we &apos;re ready to process your release .
you still need me , david .
and i will always need you .
david ?
so , i just got you all to myself
and now i have to share you with your this new client ?
oh , is somebody jealous ?
who ?
me ? no .
yeah , you &apos;re jealous .
oh , no , i &apos;m not . no , no .
no ?
no .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
why ?
&apos;cause i kind of like it .
fire whoever &apos;s on that phone .
margaux lemarchal .
is it confirmed ?
okay , run it immediately , all media outlets .
and we need a presence at that press conference .
he now says his murder was a smokescreen .
conrad grayson kidnapped him in prison ...
and then held him in a silo
on a remote grayson property .
it &apos;s david clarke .
mr. clarke has agreed to cooperate with the fbi ...
he &apos;s alive .
as they continue to investigate
his harrowing story .
mr. clarke is expected to make a public statement
in just a few minutes .
hey , you all right , man ?
yeah .
yeah . sorry for freaking out in the lineup .
what , are you kidding ?
come on . that guy &apos;s your father @-@ in @-@ law , right ?
look , i understand , but you should &apos;ve filled me in .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
thought maybe i was seeing things
until i saw emily &apos;s reaction .
yeah , well , she &apos;s pretty upset .
she tried to get past the feds .
she wants answers just like you , for amanda .
well , listen . i think i &apos;m gonna --
i &apos;m gonna go .
what , now ?
but he &apos;s about to be released .
you must have a ton of questions for him .
d @-@ don &apos;t you at least want to meet him
after all this time ?
no .
and if it &apos;s all the same to you ,
i don &apos;t want him knowing i &apos;m on the force yet .
i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m not ready to see him .
after hours of speculation ,
we are now moments away from a live statement
from the man formerly found guilty
of one of the most heinous acts of terror
this country has ever seen .
given his sensational and surprising tale
of the past 10 years ,
it is safe to say david clarke , once hated ,
may now be the new symbol of hope and courage .
thank you for coming .
i &apos;m here for him , not you .
i @-@ i prayed for this moment ,
this freedom ,
and today , uh , my prayers were answered .
and i never imagined seeing this kind of support
from a public who had condemned me
and a family that i thought had forgotten about me .
he shouldn &apos;t be up there alone .
no , no , no . just wait .
victoria ...
charlotte ...
please join me ?
mrs. grayson ,
seems your family can &apos;t escape the ghosts of the past .
charlotte and i are focused on the future ...
and getting to know david once again .
david has been through a --
a horrific experience
at the hands of my late ex @-@ husband ,
conrad grayson , who was an evil , evil man .
we all need time to understand and to process .
we ask for privacy at this moment
so that david could readjust
and to be with loved ones ...
and his family .
that &apos;s all the questions for now .
what just happened ?
