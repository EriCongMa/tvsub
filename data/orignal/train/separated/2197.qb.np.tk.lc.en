danny , what are you doing here ?
uh , this is my partner , steve mcgarrett .
steve , this is my lovely ex @-@ wife , rachel .
you didn &apos;t have to come here .
yes , i did .
thank you .
stan only booked this trip
to see if we could save our marriage .
i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s anything left to save .
stan &apos;s coming home tomorrow night .
i have to tell him .
i &apos;m pregnant .
i &apos;m definitely ...
yes .
okay , good . good , good , good . okay .
rachel ... is moving back in with stan .
the baby &apos;s his ?
turns out , uh , she &apos;s further along than she thought ,
so she is gonna try to make it work with stan
for the ... for the kid &apos;s sake .
i &apos;m sorry , danny .
hello , chin .
what do you want , gabriel ?
i have something you &apos;re gonna want to see .
only thing we found was this envelope .
x @-@ rays show it &apos;s safe to open .
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . i &apos;m coming , i &apos;m coming .
chin .
you all right ?
why didn &apos;t you loop me in ?
i mean , i would &apos;ve gone with you .
they said no chaperones . they were pretty clear .
well , i hope the intel was worth the risk .
it was .
the man in these photos is goro shioma .
he works in tokyo finance . or at least that &apos;s his day job .
according to sources in the japanese underworld ,
he &apos;s also the oyabun
of a major yakuza syndicate .
he has a legitimate job .
it &apos;s possible adam didn &apos;t know about the yakuza connection .
i might be willing to believe that , except word is
that shioma was actually really tight with adam &apos;s father .
in fact , after wo fat killed hiro ,
there was a rumor going around that shioma
put a price on wo fat &apos;s head .
there &apos;s no way that adam doesn &apos;t know who he really is .
chin , we still don &apos;t know that these meetings
were about anything illegal .
right .
so i &apos;m sure adam is just there , uh ,
collecting the bounty on your behalf .
my cousin &apos;s getting married in three days , steve .
i get that . listen to me .
you go ahead , you go and accuse adam
of getting back into bed with the yakuza
and you &apos;re wrong ,
you &apos;re gonna drive a wedge between the two of you ,
and kono &apos;s gonna be caught in the middle , all right ?
now , we need the facts . we need all the facts .
until we know what these meetings were actually about ,
i think you say nothing .
evening , officer .
evening .
relax , you &apos;re not in trouble .
pulled you over &apos; cause you got an intermittent taillight .
sorry , i had no idea .
it happens . probably just a loose bulb .
tell you what , pop the trunk , we &apos;ll take a look .
oh , no , that &apos;s okay .
loose bulb sounds like an easy fix .
yeah , but it could be something else .
an issue with the wiring . corrosion at the socket .
you know what , it &apos;s not even my car-- it &apos;s my buddy &apos;s .
i &apos;d rather let him deal with it .
got some bruising on your knuckles .
what happened there ?
i &apos;m not sure .
must &apos;ve scraped &apos; em .
sir , what do you got in the trunk ?
nothing .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need you to hand over the keys
and place your hands on the wheel .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
pass me the keys . hands on the wheel .
i &apos;m not gonna ask again .
all right ...
hey , man , what is this ?
hold on ! you can &apos;t do this ! wait !
do not open that trunk !
do not open it !
you hear me ? don &apos;t open it !
hey , yourself .
you want some pancakes ?
mmm ... are we talking the macadamia nut ones
from the wailana coffee house ?
we &apos;re talking about the ...
chocolate chip ones from the kitchen .
okay .
okay .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s just , uh ...
it &apos;s just work .
all right . i &apos;m gonna go take a shower ,
okay .
get those pancakes going .
i &apos;m gonna make some coffee .
danny !

so , as you can see ,
arbor &apos;s here ,
and the procession is going to enter from over there .
once everybody is in place , a conch shell will be blown .
that &apos;s your cue to enter .
sounds good .
all right , let &apos;s see what else .
final playlist , check .
final fitting , check . vows ?
we &apos;re working on them .
check .
you know , i never asked you :
how did you and adam meet ?
work .
so common nowadays .
oh , by the way , i &apos;m gonna need your parents &apos; flight info .
i want to arrange an airport pick @-@ up .
oh , no need-- my , uh , mom and dad , they live here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i just assumed , uh ...
well , usually ,
if they live close by , the mother of the bride
is super hands @-@ on with the wedding planning , and ...
mine hasn &apos;t been .
her health isn &apos;t too good .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you know , that &apos;s actually just been
the hardest part of this whole process .
not having her involved .
i just always assumed that ,
if and when there was a time to plan a wedding ,
that she would be there ,
doing it with me , every step of the way .
well , she is going to be there on your wedding day ,
and that is the most important thing of all .
yeah .
nervous yet ?
no .
no , i &apos;m more excited .
&apos;cause , um ...
it &apos;s taken us a long time to get here .
yeah , i &apos;m just really glad
that we &apos;re finally doing this .
wait a sec . wait a sec .
you do something wrong ? what &apos;d you do wrong ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve been thinking about it .
i &apos;m wracking my brain . i can &apos;t figure it out .
but rachel &apos;s definitely upset about something .
you think it &apos;s amber @-@ related ?
melissa .
oh , that &apos;s official now ?
well , yes , it is her name , so i think it &apos;s official .
and that &apos;s not what it is . i don &apos;t think so , anyway .
you know ? and i had to lie to her this morning .
rachel ?
no , melissa .
wait , i &apos;m confused .
all the text messages ... i &apos;m getting all the text messages .
she asked me what was going on . i had to lie .
said it was about work .
why ? why would you do that ?
because it &apos;s drama with my ex @-@ wife .
i don &apos;t want to get her spooked thinking
that there &apos;s a problem with the crazy ex @-@ wife ,
and then she feels like she &apos;s got to take off ,
hold on , hold on .
i distinctly remember melissa having drama with her ex
and you being very understanding about the whole thing .
that &apos;s true . i was very cool about that , wasn &apos;t i ?
are you kidding me ? very cool ?
the guy stabbed you , almost killed you .
you almost died . so , yeah , you were cool .
you know what you do ? here &apos;s what you do .
you call rachel-- i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
you call melissa-- you just be straight with her .
i &apos;m telling ...
a therapist . great .
good morning .
morning .
well , gentlemen , it appears we have a traffic stop
that escalated into a shoot @-@ out .
is the officer okay ?
well , he took one to the chest .
the paramedics took him over to king .
he &apos;s critical but stable ,
which is more than i can say for the guy he pulled over--
he took one to the head .
and this is where it starts to get weird .
there &apos;s no i.d. on the vic ,
no weapon recovered .
he &apos;s got one hand cuffed , and , as you can see ...
no car .
all right , so there was a passenger ...
gets into a shoot @-@ out with the officer .
this guy gets clipped . officer gets clipped .
then the passenger slides over and takes the car .
that would explain a lot .
captain grover ?
oh , good . csu &apos;s just pulled up the dash cam footage .
that should give us some answers .
all right , let &apos;s run that plate .
car &apos;s unregistered .
do not open that trunk ,
looks like there &apos;s someone
you hear me ?
in the trunk .
you &apos;re all right , sir , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
well , you &apos;re certainly in the ballpark
with your passenger theory .
lou , roll it back . see if we can pull a frame
where the killer &apos;s actually facing the camera .
no . no good .
image is too blurry for facial rec .
all right , so a patrolman
pulls over a guy for a broken taillight ,
ends up interrupting a kidnapping .
not exactly your average traffic stop , is it ?
it &apos;s not exactly your average kidnapping , either .
why do you say that ?
how many kidnapping victims you know
shoot the person who &apos;s trying to help them ?
over to me once the evidence is processed .
everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s great .
what do we know ?
hfd got the call after 6 : 00 a.m.
car was still burning when they got here .
all right , we definite it &apos;s the same car ?
yeah , license plates match .
csu found this in the car .
gas can and rubber hose .
yeah , i &apos;m thinking our killer used &apos; em
to siphon the fuel out of the gas tank .
it &apos;s a smart plan .
he torches the car and there goes any chance
we have of recovering any prints or dna .
hpd canvass the area ?
yeah , no witnesses so far .
yeah , no cameras , either--
traffic , atm or private .
this area &apos;s just one giant blind spot .
well , i think it &apos;s safe to assume
he didn &apos;t chose this location at random .
obviously , we &apos;re dealing with someone
who knows how to cover their tracks .
which means i.d. &apos; ing this guy won &apos;t be easy .
well , hopefully danny and steve
are having better luck with the driver .
gentleman , you are in luck .
i ran your john doe &apos;s prints through afis
and found a hit .
meet greg farmer .
he is a bail enforcement agent licensed out of nevada .
he was a bounty hunter .
so the guy in the trunk must have been a skip .
well , if that &apos;s the case , we need to find
the bail bondsman farmer was working for ,
see if we can figure out who he came here to grab .
well , that &apos;s not gonna be very easy .
most bounty hunters work freelance .
they &apos;re not , uh , exclusive to one bail bondsman .
well , max , you got something to contribute here , or ...
well , the bounty hunter boba fett worked for both
jabba the hutt and darth vader ,
so i understand the point
that detective williams was trying to make .
right .
moving on . uh , any other findings ?
yes . i found traces of fresh asphalt
on the soles of the victim &apos;s shoes .
and it might be interesting to note
that csu found traces of similar asphalt mixture
in the trunk of the car that was recovered .
most likely a transfer from the killer &apos;s shoes .
so this guy and the guy from the trunk
both stepped on fresh pavement somewhere .
yeah , well , if we could figure out which street it was ,
maybe it could lead to our shooter &apos;s i.d.
so i checked in with the honolulu transportation department .
they told me there was only one resurfacing project
on the entire island last night .
2000 block of anakole place .
it &apos;s in pearl city ,
it &apos;s a residential neighborhood
and the crew was done about 2 : 00 a.m. this morning .
all right , what do we know about the residents on the street ?
i ran background on all of &apos; em ,
and they all checked out except one guy :
david sutter .
he moved into a house about a year ago .
he &apos;s the only renter on the block ,
and his landlord said that when he rented the place ,
he paid six months in advance , in cash .
well , that does sound a little suspicious .
that ain &apos;t the half of it .
turns out david sutter showed the landlord
a hawai &apos;i drivers license when he rented the place ,
so i run it through dmv-- no record of him .
and there &apos;s also no employment ,
tax , or credit history on the guy .
fake i.d. &apos; s , lots of cash , aliases .
sounds like somebody on the run to me .
i &apos;m gonna send his address information
to you on your gps right now .
all right . thanks , lou .
so , uh , you bringing a date to the ... to the wedding ?
no , no ... i mean , i hadn &apos;t planned on it .
well , i mean , you &apos;re just gonna be sitting
at the singles table with , uh , kamekona , jerry and flippa .
i &apos;ll be fine .
well , you &apos;ll be hungry , is what you &apos;re gonna be .
why don &apos;t you bring ellie ?
no , no . ellie &apos;s , uh , you know , she &apos;s my buddy .
i don &apos;t want to ... i don &apos;t want to ruin that ,
ask her to the wedding , make her believe ...
yeah , yeah , no , i get it .
you know , melissa has a friend ...
no . i &apos;m ... no .
but she &apos;s very cute .
no .
what no ?
no . no , because no .
steve , you got to move on at some point , okay ?
it &apos;s been a year .
all right , i was with catherine for a long time .
okay ? i &apos;m good ...
at the moment . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not ready to jump into something
with somebody else , that &apos;s all .
i appreciate ... i appreciate it .
it &apos;s a simple question .
done . done . all right .
can melissa &apos;s friend send a picture ? that &apos;s all .
what is ... what is that ?
that &apos;s a wall of silence .
i just put up a wall of silence .
oh , is that what that is ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s gonna shut me up .
gonna make you change the subject .
nothing can shut you up .
so that &apos;s a &quot; no &quot; on the picture ?
send the pict ...
you have the brain of a five @-@ year @-@ old .
so much as twitch , i empty your heads on the carpet .
you &apos;re not him .
nope .
but if he ever shows , i own his ass .
i was here first .
another bounty hunter . hello .
all right , buddy , just take it easy , we &apos;re cops , all right ?
okay .
and i &apos;m the dalai lama .
now drop the hardware .
do it slow .
well , you see , those two actions ,
they don &apos;t really go together .
he &apos;s right , you can &apos;t ...
it &apos;s impossible to drop something slowly .
okay , how &apos;s this :
gently place your weapons on the floor .
no problem .
that i can do .
no @-@ no problem at all .
okay .
come on , man .
hands behind your back .
seriously ? we &apos;re all in the same fraternity here .
huh ? i told you we &apos;re cops .
new york .
you &apos;re a long way from home .
hey , danny , i want you to meet richie malloy .
hi , richie .
danny .
what do you got ?
i got a lot of stuff .
i got a stash piece ,
i got a stun gun and , uh , some mace .
he &apos;s like a walking armory .
yeah , well pelham &apos;s one dangerous dude .
pelham ? that &apos;s his real name ?
yeah , andrew pelham .
you boys are a few steps behind , aren &apos;t you ?
apparently , so why don &apos;t you catch us up ?
who &apos;s pelham ?
all right , for starters , he &apos;s one of you .
what do you mean , &quot; one of us &quot; ?
the killer we &apos;re looking for , he &apos;s a cop .
pelham . p @-@ e @-@ l @-@ h @-@ a @-@ m ?
h @-@ a @-@ m .
got him , charged with three different homicides ,
all on long island .
yeah , two years ago .
vics were all women in their early 20s .
it says here , he broke into their houses ,
tortured them and then killed them .
a real credit to your profession , huh ?
explain something to me : how does this guy ever make bail ?
&apos;cause the original case against him was crap .
the first vic , she was a college student ,
jennifer leddy .
went missing over christmas break .
well , the cops investigated ,
and they found pelham &apos;s dna in her apartment ,
but that was it , so , all they had him on
was a b and e.
a month after he makes bail ,
they found leddy &apos;s body .
then they found two more .
trace evidence on one linked to pelham .
so cops had him dead to rights , he splits town ,
been hiding out here ever since .
kept out of trouble .
even got himself a job as a dog @-@ walker .
that &apos;s smart-- low profile , cash business .
all right , how &apos;d you figure out that pelham was on oahu ?
i didn &apos;t .
another bounty hunter tracked him down .
but i got a mole inside this other guy &apos;s operation ,
and she gave me the heads up that her boss was coming out ,
gave me all the intel they have on pelham , so ...
got my ass on a plane .
uh , let me ask you a question ,
that , uh , other bounty hunter &apos;s named greg farmer ?
how &apos;d you know ?
farmer &apos;s dead .
what ? !
last night , he grabbed pelham ,
bagged him up , put him in the truck of a car .
an officer pulled him over for a broken taillight ,
checks his trunk , pelham makes his move ,
shoots the officer , executes farmer .
there was no love lost between farmer and me ,
but i never wanted the hump to get dead .
anyway ...
given what &apos;s happened , i got no problem backing off ,
letting you guys go after pelham without me cramping your style .
i appreciate that .
uh , unless you need my help .
no , i think we &apos;re , uh , i think we got it .
okay .
you know what , i @-@ i &apos;m just gonna float this .
pelham is worth 40 grand .
you let me take him back to new york ,
i kick back a portion of that to your local ...
widows and orphans fund .
no ?
all right , well , i guess it was worth a shot .
well , seeing as how i done nothing wrong ,
i think i &apos;m free to go .
so if you could just ...
uncuff me ,
and , uh , hand me nora ,
i &apos;ll be on my way .
happy hunting , gentlemen .
thank you .
here .
all right , we got to get csu out here to process this place ,
see if they can turn up anything that &apos;s gonna help us
figure out what pelham &apos;s next move is .
oh , boy .
is that rachel ?
yep . &quot; at the park now .
really need to see you .
it &apos;s important . &quot;
go , go .
thanks .
thanks for coming .
i remember this-- having a panic attack
every time grace got to the top of the monkey bars .
so , what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s charlie .
he &apos;s sick , danny .
what do you mean , sick ?
he has something called hlh .
it &apos;s a disease that effects his immune system .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s rare .
well , how , uh ... how serious is it ?
it could kill him .
rachel ...
the good news is , there is treatment .
his best option is a bone marrow transplant ,
but the problem is finding a match ,
and usually , siblings are the best ones .
so , what , you want my permission for grace , or @-@ or what ?
we &apos;ve tested grace . she &apos;s not a match .
but every parent is called a half @-@ match .
it &apos;s not their first choice ,
but doctors can use that bone marrow .
the point is , one parent is usually
a better half @-@ match than the other .
why are you telling me this ?
that &apos;s my kid ?
how long have you known this , rachel ?
you &apos;ve always known .
danny , i ...
why would keep something like this from me ?
because ...
your life and the chances that you take .
the chances i take ?
see , if anything ever happened to you ,
i didn &apos;t want two kids growing up without a father .
you had no right to do that .
you understand that ?
you had no right to keep that from me , that i got a son .
i know that you hate me right now ,
and i don &apos;t blame you for hating me ,
but i am telling you now .
we have a son , and there is something wrong with him ,
something that could kill him .
he needs our help .
okay . okay , so what ... ?
so , what happens now ?
you need to take a blood test .
it won &apos;t take long , a few minutes .
24 hours to get the result ,
and then the doctors can decide
how to proceed from there .
and then , they set everything up then ?
yes .
what about stan ?
what does he know ?
he knows now .
mommy , i &apos;m hungry .
well , okay , sweetheart .
we &apos;ll get you something to eat .
oh , charlie ,
you remember , um ...
you remember me , buddy .
i &apos;m , uh , grace &apos;s ...
grace &apos;s dad .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
danno .
oh , he doesn &apos;t like being called ...
no , no , no , no , you can call me danno
whenever you want . it &apos;s okay .
what , did your sister teach you that ?
yeah ?
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s good to see you again , huh ?
all right .
all right .
杀女凶手依然逍遥法外
my name is malcolm leddy .
three months ago , my only daughter jennifer ,
was the victim of a heinous crime .
this unspeakable act was committed by one individual .
andrew pelham .
jenny was a kind and decent girl .
after her mom passed away , it was just the two of us .
when she was looking at colleges ,
jenny would only consider schools that were close to home .
she said she didn &apos;t want to move too far away
because she was afraid that her dad would get ... lonely .
andrew pelham went on the run six weeks ago .
if anyone has any information regarding his whereabouts ,
please come forward .
make him see the inside of a courtroom .
let ... justice be done .
that &apos;s the father of the first victim .
so , should we reach out ?
let him know that pelham &apos;s been spotted on the island ?
well , steve doesn &apos;t want to go public yet .
he thinks we stand a better chance of catching pelham
if , uh , he doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re onto him .
got something ?
yeah . csu just finished searching pelham &apos;s place .
they found several phony passports and driver &apos;s licenses .
all told , this guy has seven different aliases .
all right , well , let &apos;s run all of &apos; em .
with any luck , he &apos;ll try and use one of &apos; em to get off the island .
do you know how many times
that i &apos;ve dropped grace off ?
you know how many times i &apos;ve picked her up ,
and that kid &apos;s been sitting in the room ?
rachel , too , sitting there ?
danny , no matter how misguided this was ...
please , don &apos;t .
do not say anything that sticks up for this woman , okay ?
what she did is unforgiveable , and that is the bottom line .
and because of what she did ,
i missed out three years of this kid &apos;s life .
huh ? what about that ?
so what happens now ?
now . now , i @-@ i take care of the kid .
but rachel-- i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
no way i get past this .
you &apos;re right , man .
i know i &apos;m right . thank you .
do me a favor-- listen to me for a second , all right ?
these feelings that you &apos;re having , this anger--
you got to put it aside , that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
how many decisions are you guys gonna have to make ,
from here on in ?
and you and rachel-- you got to make the decisions together .
danny , it &apos;s not gonna do charlie any good
having his parents fighting .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m trying to say .
i know that . you &apos;re right .
all right ?
yeah , chin , what &apos;s up ?
so we ran all of pelham &apos;s aliases ,
turns out he used one to purchase a plane ticket online ,
just a few minutes ago .
well , did you trace the ip ?
yeah , it &apos;s an apartment downtown .
we think the owner of the place
is one of pelham &apos;s dog @-@ walking clients .
yeah , it looks like he could be using
the apartment as a safe house .
andrew pelham !
let me see your hands right now !
poor man &apos;s gps .
this is how he found us .
malloy probably planted that
while we were still at pelham &apos;s place .
yeah , we underestimated him .
clearly , he &apos;s not as dumb as he looks .
well , let &apos;s look at the bright side ,
at least pelham &apos;s in custody , right ?
pelham already killed a bounty hunter while he was in custody .
until he &apos;s in our custody , i &apos;m not gonna rest easy .
what is that ?
little something to help you relax .
got to deliver you alive and intact ,
or i don &apos;t get paid .
i got money , you know .
could pay you a lot more than what
that bail bondsman will give you .
you think i can be bought ?
so i tried pinging malloy &apos;s cell ,
but it &apos;s been turned off .
and , uh ... we &apos;re tracking his credit cards ,
but i can &apos;t imagine he &apos;ll be using them .
what about his car ?
well , hpd plate readers are scanning every car on the road--
so far , nothing .
well , after malloy grabbed pelham ,
he probably threw on some new plates .
either that or he had a switch @-@ car nearby .
all right , here &apos;s the problem .
we are working at a major disadvantage .
we &apos;re trying to find somebody
who finds people who don &apos;t want to be found for a living .
i mean , he &apos;s got tricks ,
he &apos;s hip to stuff that we don &apos;t know .
danny &apos;s right-- we want to find malloy ,
we &apos;re gonna need some help .
hey , dog .
mcgarrett , williams-- long time , no see .
what &apos;s up , buddy , you got a minute ?
yeah , let me book this lolo , i &apos;ll be right back , all right ?
uh , we can handle it .
officers , do me a favor , take this guy in ,
process him and get a body receipt , please ?
all right , thank you .
mahalo .
boy , this must be pretty important with that kind of service .
yeah , it is .
we &apos;re , uh , we &apos;re actually looking
for a fellow bounty hunter , his name &apos;s malloy .
he has a dangerous fugitive with him .
he &apos;s trying to get off the island right now .
under no circumstances can we let that happen .
so you want to know what this cat &apos;s next move is , right ?
yeah , yeah , i mean , if it was you , what would you do ?
how would you get him back to the mainland ?
yeah , we need some trade secrets , dog ,
some insider info-- can you help us out ?
so this is on the dl , right ?
there is a way off this rock
that only people in my line of work know about .
you ever heard of transair ?
yeah , i have .
it &apos;s a cargo plane for deliveries .
yep , for cash up front ,
they &apos;ll ferry the bounty hunter and his prey
to and from the mainland , no questions asked ,
no paperwork , all under the radar .
dog told us that there &apos;s a transair flight
that lands at midnight ,
midnight every night ,
in los angeles , you understand what that means .
it &apos;s gonna take off any second . i did the math .
so you understand that we &apos;re gonna be late .
the only way this vehicle is gonna
go any faster is if you throw yourself out of it .
chin , what do you got ?
we may have a problem .
kono and i have been monitoring malloy &apos;s financials ,
and we came across a six @-@ figure wire transfer
from an offshore account .
transaction happened less than an hour ago .
what six figures ?
uh , malloy was getting $ 40,000 , he said .

malloy , man , i got ...
you &apos;re a piece of work , buddy .
hey , listen , i can understand
if you &apos;re a little upset about getting punked back there .
uncalled for .
hey , you let that monster go .
you &apos;re lucky we don &apos;t put a bullet in your ass .
you aided and abetted .
all right , you want to stay out of prison ?
you give us something , right now ,
that helps us find pelham right now .
well , you &apos;re wrong .
i didn &apos;t let him go .
i delivered him to malcolm leddy .
he came to me a few months ago ,
offered me 300 thou , his entire life savings .
all i had to do was deliver the man
that murdered his daughter .
so what happened after you handed pelham over ?
i don &apos;t know .
me and leddy traded cars , i took off .
all right , you think leddy killed him right there ?
no . i think he wants to take his time .
how do we find him ?
i don &apos;t know-- he didn &apos;t exactly share his plans with me .
well , you must have his cell phone number .
you guys kept in touch , no ?
hey , daddy , just wanted to wish the sweetest ,
kindest , most handsome dad
a happy father &apos;s day .
i love you so , so much .
and i &apos;m just so thankful to be your daughter .

hey , daddy , just wanted to wish the sweetest ,
kindest , most handsome dad

i love you so ...
hello , mr. pelham .
what is this ?
karma .
comeuppance .
i know you .
you &apos;re the guy , the one who went on television .
jenny &apos;s dad .
don &apos;t ...
don &apos;t you dare say her name .
what do you know about me , mr. pelham ?
anything ?
nothing ?
well , let me fill you in .
i went to med school ,
but i dropped out during my first year of residency .
i quit because my wife passed away very suddenly .
our daughter was only a year at the time .
but i remember everything they taught me .
i know how much pain a person can endure before passing out .
i know how long it takes to recover .
i know how to keep a person alive ,
even when letting them die would be more humane .
when this is all over ,
you will beg me to kill you .
what is it ?
this is commander mcgarrett of five @-@ o.
starting the trace .
mr. leddy .
mr. leddy , are you there ?
i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s not a good time .
sir , please listen to me .
i know why you came here .
i know what you came here to do .
and i &apos;m begging you not to go through with this .
it &apos;s not gonna accomplish anything , sir .
it won &apos;t ...
bring back my daughter ?
bring me peace ?
you want me to just ... turn this all over
to the criminal justice system , is that it ?
yes .
yeah , they &apos;ve done such a bang @-@ up job so far .
sir , please .
i understand wanting vengeance .
i swear to you , i do-- but killing pelham ,
it &apos;ll feel good for a moment , but that &apos;s it .
now , we got enough evidence to put this bastard away .
i want him in a prison cell , sir , not you .
what makes you think i &apos;m going to prison ?
when you get here , you &apos;re gonna find two bodies .
think about jenny .
would she really want this ?
you &apos;re not a killer .
you don &apos;t know me .
and you didn &apos;t know her .
guys , we got him .
he &apos;s in waimanalo .
i want him to suffer .
i want him to suffer the way she suffered .
he &apos;s a cop , okay ?
he &apos;s a cop , and i &apos;m gonna put him in prison .
you think he &apos;s gonna have an easy time in there ?
he will suffer , you have my word , he will suffer .
malcolm , wherever you are , please ,
i &apos;m begging you , please walk away .
i &apos;m begging you .
sorry .
can &apos;t do it .
malcolm ...
malcolm .
the medical examiner ...
thought you might have started with her fingers .
is that right ?
who can remember ?
going to voice mail .
try it again .
next , you cut off her scalp ...
didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m sorry , jenny .
not so easy in the moment , is it ?
it &apos;s funny .
how you could think about nothing else .
work it over in your mind ,
gaming it out .
all the ways it could go down .
everything that could go wrong .
until it &apos;s happening ...
you don &apos;t really know if you can go through with it .
that &apos;s right .
call the police .
have them do what you can &apos;t .
danny , call ems .
part of me really wants you to try .
hey , guys ...
hold on for a second .
i &apos;m gonna put that man away ,
and he &apos;s never gonna get out , all right ?
and that &apos;s the way it should be .
thank you .
you &apos;re gonna be all right , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna call ellie .
i mean , there &apos;s got to be some kind of deal we can make ,
help reduce malcolm &apos;s charges .
what &apos;s going on ? you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m just thinking about
what this poor guy &apos;s been through .
i mean , losing a kid , there &apos;s , uh ...
there &apos;s nothing that could be worse , you know ?
yeah .
they &apos;re running about five minutes behind .
okay , so can i , um , sign something or anything or ... ?
they &apos;ll take care of the paperwork when they call you .
okay .
hey , buddy .

is that a rescue truck ?
rescue truck .
yeah , i used to have one
just like this one , same thing .
can i see it ? yeah ?
how does this thing work ? does it light up ?
of course it lights up , what a stupid question .
