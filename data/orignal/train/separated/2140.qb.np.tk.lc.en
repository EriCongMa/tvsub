i &apos;m gonna die , danny .
no , you &apos;re not .
just hang in there . you &apos;re gonna be all right .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t realize anyone was in here .
that &apos;s all right .
hey , i can leave if ...
no , it &apos;s okay . i ...
i can use the company .
okay .
my wife &apos;s in surgery .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
she beat cancer a few years back ,
and put up with me for 45 years ,
so this should be a walk in the park .
right .
what happened to you ?
work related injury .
if you don &apos;t mind me asking , what type of work do you do ?
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m in law enforcement .
five @-@ 0 task force .
what ?
i was a cop , too .
long time ago .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
you were a cop ?
you &apos;ve been married for 45 years ?
what &apos;s your secret ?
no secret .
i just met the right gal .
what about you ?
you married ? girlfriend ?
no .
well , i &apos;m sure the right woman &apos;s out there for you somewhere .
what if i already met the right woman ,
and , uh , and i couldn &apos;t hang on to her ?
then she wasn &apos;t the right woman .
yeah , see , i &apos;m not so sure about that .
sometimes it feels like
this job of mine has taken everything good from me .
i &apos;ve been wearing the badge for six years ,
and i &apos;m really starting to wonder whether ...
whether any of it &apos;s worth it .
son , what we do can &apos;t be quantified .
your worth is measured in the closure you bring ,
the people you save .
that &apos;s your real legacy .
and the best legacy a man can leave behind
is the people whose lives he &apos;s changed .
trust me .

all right , one more flip ought to do it .
here we go .
we &apos;re ready .

you see , that &apos;s the mouth , and
that @-@ that little chocolate chip there-- that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s the eye .
right ?
i thought that was venice .
that ... how do you even know where venice ... ?
may have a point there .
you know what your problem is ?
you &apos;re just a little bit too smart , i think .
you just got no pancake game .
is that right ?
like i said ...
okay , small bites , easy on the syrup .
i &apos;ll be right back .
can i help you ?
lieutenant kelly ,
i &apos;m ailana read , child services .
may i come in ?
yes , of course .
it was my impression that sara could stay the weekend , no ?
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
yesterday morning , we finally managed
to locate sara &apos;s aunt and uncle in mexico .
okay . and ?
they &apos;ve retained a lawyer and are taking steps to adopt sara .
i understand you two have gotten close ,
so i thought it would be best if i told you in person .
i appreciate that .
um , how long before it &apos;s finalized ?
it &apos;s being expedited by the mexican courts
so we believe no more than a month .
you still hungry ?
good , because you know ,
i save my best characters for last .
i sure hope so .
what ? ! all right , now it &apos;s on .
you just wait .
oh , yeah , that seems like a real good idea .
on your right ! on your right !
yeah , later , ricky bobby .
i got ten bucks on super seal .
oh , sister , you got yourself a bet .
karma &apos;s a bitch .
watch out .
watch out !
it &apos;s over , partner . it is over .
over , you hear me ?
that felt really good .
mahalo .
you can &apos;t call it &quot; victory &quot; if you cheat .
i did not cheat . i did not che--
i did the same thing he would &apos;ve done , only sooner .
besides he was drafting off me the whole time .
where in the rule book does it say i can &apos;t do that ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s probably
right next to the page where it says ,
&quot; you &apos;re an idiot if you challenge somebody to a wheelchair race . &quot;
bigger idiot if you accept ...
kono , i know what you &apos;re trying to do ,
and you ain &apos;t getting your money back .
you know what , mcgarrett ?
i thought when you had your near @-@ death experience
and your man gave you part of his liver that you &apos;d become closer ,
but now that that &apos;s been blown to hell ,
we &apos;ll settle it like this ,
have another wheelchair race
next time you &apos;re both in the hospital .
that @-@ that should be very soon .
all right . knowing this genius .
clear .
clear .
you &apos;re good .
vic &apos;s name is anthony lee hein ,
32 years old .
he did six months community service
on a stalking charge two years ago .
now according to his probation officer ,
he works at a quick &apos; n easy auto shine ,
it &apos;s a car wash in pearl city .
all right , family ?
mother lives in town .
make the notification .
be sure to let her know that we &apos;re handling the case , okay ?
all right .
oh , abby ?
yeah ?
badge looks good on you .
welcome to hpd .
mahalo .
noelani , what do you got ?
i &apos;m seeing obvious signs of asphyxiation ,
bruises and fingernail scratches on the neck ,
contusions around the throat , petechial hemorrhaging .
he &apos;s got blood around his mouth .
that &apos;s not unusual during suffocation .
victims will often bite down on their tongue during the attack .
what is that ?
what is that ?
i have no idea .
okay , so this thingie you pulled out of the victim &apos;s mouth
is hand @-@ carved , made of walrus ivory .
sale of walrus ivory &apos;s heavily regulated now ,
so that &apos;s either an old pre @-@ ban piece or black market , right ?
or a legally purchased native alaskan carving .
i &apos;m still running tests to determine the exact age .
all right , any idea what it &apos;s supposed to be ?
besides ugly ?
could be folk art . still working on that , too .
what about the bag we found around the victim &apos;s head ?
looks like dry cleaner plastic .
no way to determine the origin though
&apos;cause it &apos;s pretty much used in every dry cleaner in the u.s.
anything else ?
yeah !
what about the new m.e. ?
i mean , is it just me or is she kind of like
the female max bergman ?
but way hotter , you know what i mean ?
okay , that &apos;s enough .
you &apos;re being inappropriate . we got to go .
oh , come on , morgue girl &apos;s kind of cute , right ?
she &apos;s got that sexified island thing and a brain .
noelani .
means heavenly mist .
parents got that one right .
plus a little birdie told me she just got out of a relationship
and is very single .
guys ? guys !
i apologize .
blood relative .
isn &apos;t he ?
if-- look , there &apos;s no reason ...
that specifically is not a reason to keep him around .
if you want to send him back to new jersey
where he can offend people over there , i &apos;m fine with that .
all right .
what &apos;s that ? what are you doing ?
taking my meds .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re gonna bother doing that .
you &apos;re not gonna follow any of the other post @-@ op instructions .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not gonna pull over and take a nap right now .
yeah , you know , five @-@ 0 task force .
&quot; force &quot; being the operative word , right ?
it means that we have the manpower
to take care of certain situations
if you got to sit on the sidelines , you know what i mean ?
hey , buddy , you want to sit this out , it &apos;s okay .
no , see , see ...
it &apos;s not a problem .
i &apos;m not the person who almost died , okay ?
that was you .
and you heard what the doctor said ,
you are still in the evaluation period .
that &apos;s two to three months , okay ?
you &apos;re not supposed to even be driving a car .
you &apos;re not supposed to operate any machinery . oh , no , no ...
uh , no , that &apos;s a suggestion .
that &apos;s ... they make suggestions .
oh , yeah ?
let me tell you something .
if your body rejects my liver
because you &apos;re not taking this seriously ,
i &apos;m gonna be very upset .
you &apos;re gonna be very upset if it takes or not .
six hours .
six hours ?
six hours i laid on an operating table ,
while a team of doctors picked at my insides
and took out a vital organ to give to you .
be grateful . don &apos;t be ungrateful .
here we go .
here we go .
&quot; here we go , &quot; what does that mean , &quot; here we go &quot; ?
this is donor &apos;s remorse .
&quot; donor &apos;s remorse &quot; ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s classic donor &apos;s remorse .
what are you talking-- i &apos;m just saying show some respect !
have some genuine respect for my liver , okay ?
and follow the rules , that &apos;s all .
your liver . yeah .
let me tell you something , all right ?
possession is nine @-@ tenths of the law , okay , buddy ?
and now since your liver is in my body ,
you got no say in how i treat it , how about that ?
that &apos;s the stupidest thing i &apos;ve ever heard in my entire life .
okay ?
i don &apos;t think that goes for , uh , organ donations , okay ?
i don &apos;t think it applies !
but if it does , i think that we should change the law .
in the meantime , i &apos;d like my liver back please .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re switching places .
let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re gonna let me drive ?
no , i &apos;m gonna shut you up , is what i &apos;m gonna do .
let &apos;s go .
i can &apos;t drive . what ?
i just-- i can &apos;t drive .
can &apos;t drive ?
no .
all these years you &apos;re on at me about driving and now you say no ?
yeah .
doctor said i can &apos;t drive for about a week .
okay , well , i guess we &apos;ll just backburner this case until then .
that &apos;s obviously not an option .
very good , what do you suggest we do ?
oh , this thing handles great .
安东尼 · 李 · 海因住所
door left open .
clearly signs of a struggle .
he could &apos;ve been killed here .
steve .
yeah ?
got a torn dry cleaning bag .
chin was right , this is our primary crime scene .
this guy hein , he , uh , worked at a car wash , right ?
wh @-@ why &apos;s he got a hotel uniform ?
i got two keys here from the palekaiko resort and spa .
this one &apos;s got blood on it .
all right , guys , the manager just confirmed the keys
帕里凯可温泉度假村
we found belong to two rooms currently occupied .
all right , let &apos;s go .
all right , we &apos;ll check out the 12th floor .
you guys hit 21 .
let us know what you find .
lieutenant kelly .
what was that about ?
child services found sara &apos;s family in mexico .
and you &apos;re doing your own background check .
i know , i know , i &apos;m being overprotective ,
but she &apos;s &apos; ohana now , right ?
you got the bug , cuz .
what are you talking about ?
sara &apos;s given you a taste of fatherhood
and now you want a little one of your own .
i &apos;m not gonna lie ,
it has crossed my mind .
well , now that abby &apos;s here for good ,
what are you waiting for ?
auntie kono .
ooh , i like the sound of that .
mr. and mrs. goodman ?
my name is commander steve mcgarrett ,
i &apos;m with the five @-@ 0 task force .
mr. and mrs. goodman ,
you mind if we come in and ask you a few questions ?
aloha .
i &apos;m keiko mahoe , newly elected governor of hawaii .
and i am here to personally welcome you ...
chin , what do we got ?
we got two dead bodies here .
they &apos;ve each had their eyes gouged out .
we got exactly the same thing here .
anthony hein was a serial killer .
you know , maybe whoever murdered him knew that before we did .
when you come to hawaii ,
you &apos;re not just a tourist , you &apos;re &apos; ohana .
玛豪州长车队
are we sure these murders are connected ?
yes , ma &apos;am , they &apos;re the same m.o.
we believe it &apos;s the work of this man .
who is he ?
i &apos;m sure you heard about the body
we found at the palace this morning .
that was this guy ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
lab found traces of all four victims &apos; blood on his clothing .
it doesn &apos;t appear that either of the couples knew each other .
there were no valuables missing at either of the crime scenes .
so far , everything &apos;s pointing towards this being serial .
why the eyes ?
we believe it has something to do with the fact
that they were tourists .
here to admire our beautiful island .
yes , ma &apos;am .
so this guy murders four people within days of each other
at the same hotel , then turns up dead ?
what &apos;s going on here , commander ?
we &apos;re not sure .
could be a vigilante ,
maybe this guy had a partner who turned on him ,
we just ... we don &apos;t know yet .
we need to keep what happened here from the press .
if people think they can &apos;t be safe in their hotel rooms ,
we jeopardize the one thing this island relies on the most .
we cover this up and another tourist is killed ,
then what ?
what do we do then ?
commander , governor denning told me two things
when i moved into this office .
the first was ,
&quot; never go to an event without two copies of a speech . &quot;
the second was ,
&quot; don &apos;t ever underestimate the five @-@ o task force . &quot;
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , to tell you that you have my full support .
so do your job and make sure this doesn &apos;t happen again .
csu recovered hein &apos;s cellphone from his house .
and it turns out he recorded both hotel murders
and sent the recordings to someone via e @-@ mail .
you know who ?
no , not yet .
hein used a secure e @-@ mail provider to send the files ,
so everything &apos;s encrypted .
mcgarrett thinks he may have had a partner ,
so maybe that &apos;s who he sent the recordings to .
something else .
the hotel murders weren &apos;t the only recordings stored on the phone .
there was a third recording .
another murder ?
sounded like two different screams .
could be two more victims out there .
i also heard some noise in the background .
waves crashing , maybe a plane overhead .
you both have very good ears , lieutenant .
based on the acoustic analysis
i &apos;m thinking that recording took place
underneath the honolulu airport flight path .
probably in a house near ewa beach .
talk about a needle in a haystack .
yeah .
chin ?
i see it .
yeah .
can you believe this view ?
amazing , right ?
wish you guys were here .
wait , justin wants to say hi .
aloha .
i talked to the company that rents the house .
vics are justin and michelle lowe .
they &apos;re from bloomington , minnesota .
two more tourists .
yeah , m.e. estimates that they were murdered five days ago ,
so we have to assume that they were hein &apos;s first victims .
right , unless there &apos;s other bodies out there .
tell me you got something .
struck out on identifying who hein sent the e @-@ mails to .
but i did manage to figure out
that the recipient opened the account
two days before the ewa beach murders .
well , that &apos;s not a coincidence .
whoever opened that account was expecting those e @-@ mails .
all right , so maybe you were right .
hein has a partner .
i &apos;m going worldwide with it , chicago .
it &apos;s time to spread that aloha .
i &apos;m calling it the kamekona klub .
for a very low subscription rate ,
you get a new island delicacy every month .
malasadas , garlic shrimp ,
local grown coffee , shave ice .
ooh , shave ice . sounds delicious .
how you gonna ship that ?
well , it &apos;s still in r &amp; d.
which is what i &apos;d be using your capital for .
let me explain something to you , big fella .
i have not one , but two kids
that have to be put through college .
all of my capital
is going right into that bottomless pit .
bruddah , if you had a chance to get in
on the ground floor of google ,
you would of taken it , right ?
yes , and what does that have to do with you ?
this is gonna be bigger .
bigger than google ?
the most valuable company in the world ?
for now .
for ...
i got to hand it to you , big fella .
i tell you what--
let me think about it .
okay , but don &apos;t take too long .
this friends and family offer won &apos;t last long .
yeah ...
captain grover .
yeah , have a seat .
give us a minute , big fella .
you got it .
i don &apos;t have much time . i &apos;m on a deadline .
yeah , about that .
look , i know your plan to run with
what happened at the hotel .
on behalf of five @-@ 0 , i &apos;m here to ask you to hold off .
and why would i do that ?
well , for starters ,
you &apos;re gonna create a panic .
or maybe you &apos;re worried
that it would embarrass your task force ?
i &apos;d be happy to include your statement ...
for the record .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
captain , five @-@ 0 has investigated
over a hundred homicide cases .
the only reason you &apos;d be trying to suppress this
is because it &apos;s more complicated
than just four dead tourists .
okay , mr. reporter , you &apos;re right .
it is more complicated ,
which is why i &apos;m here right now ,
asking you to just hold off for a little while .
when this thing is over , i promise you ,
we will give you everything you want .
please .
hey , show me your hands !
buddy , do you want to get shot ?
get out !
we got another one .
what the hell is the killer trying to say to us ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t help you with that .
but i did get a hit on this guy &apos;s prints .
david larsen .
大卫 · 拉森住所
call the m.e. &apos; s office .
tell her we might have another body .
oh , my god .
发现多具尸体
we are hearing that a total of eight bodies
were found in the basement of this house in manoa .
however , hpd is not responding to questions at this time .
it &apos;s all over the news . every station .
networks on the mainland have picked up this story .
州长公馆
and what happened at the hotel .
that many travelers are now cancelling
their flights to hawaii .
if you &apos;re planning on visiting the islands ,
you should probably ask yourself ,
&quot; is it really worth the risk ? &quot;
what the hell is going on here , commander ?
were larsen and hein working together ?
so far , we have no evidence of that .
right now , the only thing connecting them
is whoever killed them
and dumped their bodies in our lap .
commander ,
is there a vigilante on the loose ?
we &apos;re not sure yet .
but both killers were murdered the same away .
both asphyxiated . that &apos;s a pattern , right ?
well , we can &apos;t rule out a serial killer
murdering serial killers .
you said you found photos on larsen &apos;s phone .
yeah .
tell me about those .
david larsen photographed all eight victims
before and after he killed them .
also , we believe that all of these vics were local .
why would he take pictures ? for his own amusement ?
it &apos;s possible .
these images were graphic , ma &apos;am .
much like the audio recordings
that anthony lee hein made .
and like hein ,
we believe that larsen was sharing these images
with somebody , possibly the person who murdered him .
but you can &apos;t be sure ?
no , ma &apos;am .
but it &apos;s safe to say we have a serial killer on the loose
who is targeting people like himself .
and somehow , he &apos;s onto them
before our own damn police department .
like i said , ma &apos;am , we believe
that he was working with these men ,
which would explain how he knows .
commander ,
i just spent the last three hours with my cabinet ,
discussing putting a quarantine on this island .
but if i do that ,
it &apos;ll be years before people
think it &apos;s safe to come back here .
so , before i bankrupt this place
and put the fear of god in our locals ,
do for me what you did for governor denning
and make problems like this go away .
yes , ma &apos;am .
hey . just in time . jerry says he &apos;s got something
on those ivory carvings .
what do you got ?
after much digging ,
i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that those carvings
are modeled after 11th century chess pieces .
pawns , to be exact .
chess ?
maybe whoever knocked off hein and larsen
thinks this thing is a game .
or , he was somehow using both men to commit murder .
maybe he considered them as instruments .
his pawns .
right , and after they served their purpose ,
he got rid of &apos; em .
hold that thought . there &apos;s more .
in the course of my research , i came across an open case
from eight years ago .
a young kahala couple--
steve and marissa blake--disappeared ,
along with several high priced items ,
including an 11th century @-@ style walrus ivory chess set .
look familiar ?
yeah , those are identical to the ones we recovered .
any suspects in this case ?
one , a pierre shaw , 32 years old .
recently paroled for possession of stolen goods .
please don &apos;t hurt me .
please , i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
please .
that &apos;s interesting , steve .
sorry , i was on the phone . can i , uh , help you guys ?
yeah , five @-@ 0 , mr. shaw .
just wondering if we could ask you a couple of questions .
now &apos;s not really a good time . i was just on my way out .
it won &apos;t take long at all .
couple questions .
i &apos;m kind of in a rush . maybe we could do this later ?
the conditions of your parole
allow us to drop in whenever we want .
we want to drop in right now .
is that gonna be a problem ?
no .
thanks .
anybody else here besides you ?
no , sir , i live alone .
look , i really don &apos;t know why you guys are here .
i &apos;ve been clean since i got out .
steven and marissa blake .
young couple , went missing about eight years ago .
you were a suspect in the case .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
hpd accused me of ripping &apos; em off ,
and making &apos; em disappear .
but it was crap . and they never found
no bodies or any of the stuff that went missing .
yeah , till now .
yeah , one of the things that went missing
was an ivory chess set .
and that right there is one of the pieces .
somebody !
help !
i &apos;m in here !
danny !
you okay ?
okay , hey .
you &apos;re safe , okay ? you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;m with five @-@ 0 . everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here , okay ?
guys ! shaw &apos;s on the move .
copy .
i got him !
lou , see if you can cut him off .
chin , go around .
got it !
chin , head him off !
get to the roof .
this is captain lou grover .
i need air support right away .
suspect is headed to a rooftop
on nuuanu and merchant street .
chin , i lost him . he &apos;s headed west .
i got him .
that &apos;s him !
i got him .
go !
i &apos;m going around to cut him off .
come on .
duke , we have a suspect in the pua lei .
we need a perimeter set . bring everyone you got .
five @-@ 0 . we need to seal the hotel .
no one gets in or out .
excuse me ?
did you hear the man ?
pick up the phone and call security right now .
gentlemen , i have 1,500 guests in this hotel .
what do i tell them ?
you tell them if they want to enjoy
the rest of their vacation ,
they go back to their hotel rooms ,
lock their doors and stay inside
until we say it &apos;s safe to come back out .
attention all guests .
on orders from hpd , please remain in your rooms
with the doors locked until further notice .
what &apos;s happening is almost unimaginable .
a suspected serial killer connected to the murders
of 14 people , including half a dozen tourists ,
is loose inside a popular hotel
with 1,500 guests trapped inside .
hey . how &apos;s the girl ?
locked in a room for five days .
how do you think she is ?
listen , you should go to the hospital
and get that looked at properly , okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re fine ? that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m gonna put that on your tombstone .
&quot; he said he was fine . he was wrong &quot;
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
do me a favor . give us a second ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
okay , then , give me a break . would you give me a break ?
you want a break ? all right , i &apos;ll step aside ,
watch where you get yourself killed .
is that what you want ?
not trying to get myself killed .
no ? are you sure ?
no .
because it &apos;s a relief .
because it seems like , for the last five , six years ,
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s been the goal .
again , i think you &apos;re being a little overdramatic .
okay . you know what ? forget about it .
good luck . good luck !
hey , hey , wait .
wait . wait .
wait for what ?
danny ...
what do you want ? what ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
all right , building &apos;s secure . we &apos;re going in .
all right , where &apos;s my vest ?
what do you mean where &apos;s your vest ?
where you going ?
where am i going ? i &apos;m going across the street
for a cappuccino ... where am i going ?
where do you think ?
what about the talk we just had ?
it was a very nice talk , and i meant everything i said .
i didn &apos;t say i was gonna stand down .
you &apos;re an idiot . i &apos;m done .
wait , wait , wait . wait a second .
before you strap up , listen .
we got more more than enough guys in here .
these guys are right .
you know what ? save your breath ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s determined to have my noble sacrifice be in vain .
don &apos;t give me that look .
that &apos;s good . you know what ?
if you need anybody else &apos;s organs ,
talk to chin , &apos; cause i &apos;m done .
detective dunn , good to see you .
thought you guys could use a hand .
yeah .
all right , guys , i have eyes on every floor .
my guys have been checking the elevators .
they say a service car
is not responding to the call button .
it &apos;s empty .
what was the last floor it was on ?
17th floor .
chin , check the service elevator on the 17th floor .
i got him two flights up .
eh , here we go again .
steve ! don &apos;t do it !
didn &apos;t see that coming .
well , i don &apos;t know about you guys ,
but i could sure use a beer .
oh , we &apos;re in .
definitely .
yeah , i &apos;m in , too . how about you two ?
no , we can &apos;t drink .
we can &apos;t drink .
yeah , doctor &apos;s orders . a couple months , can &apos;t drink .
makes sense . you each only have half a liver .
how about we get you some wings from side street ?
that sounds good .
tell you what , you guys have at it .
i &apos;m gonna , uh ... i &apos;m gonna head home .
eh , i &apos;ve broken pretty much
every post @-@ op rule there is to break .
i think i &apos;m gonna go rest up a little bit , you know ?
might even take a couple days off .
what ?
they &apos;re in love again .
you two .
