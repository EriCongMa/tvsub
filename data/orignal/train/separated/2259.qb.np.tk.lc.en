where &apos;s peter ?
he wasn &apos;t the wolf .
me ?
be careful . you almost shattered my wolf thing , billy .
i &apos;m sorry , ruby , but look . it &apos;s fine .
tell me about this .
it &apos;s the hat that pulled your loved ones away .
there &apos;s magic here now . there have to be ways to follow &apos; em .
without fairy dust to guide us , it &apos;s hopeless .
family is everything , my dear .
charming could &apos;ve been that hope for me ,
but instead , he made my suffering worse .
he must know pain-- my pain .
pickaxes down , brothers !
first round at granny &apos;s is on me !
come on , leroy . we &apos;re gonna miss happy hour .
granny &apos;s running a two @-@ for @-@ one special on mead .
just &apos; cause it &apos;s called &quot; happy hour , &quot; happy ,
don &apos;t mean you gotta be there .
we got work to do .
but you &apos;re tired . we all are .
a break could help .
charming asked us to mine for dust--
fairy dust--
to help bring snow and emma back home ,
and that &apos;s ...
what i &apos;m ...
gonna do !
where is it ?
are those ...
diamonds .
they &apos;re back .
the magic brought them back .
you mean the kind that become fairy dust ?
indeed . we just need to refine them , grind them up .
do you still have what remains of jefferson &apos;s hat ?
you lock this up . keep it safe .
because by this time tomorrow ,
we &apos;ll have enough magic dust to make it work again .
so mary margaret and emma--
that &apos;s right , kid .
we &apos;re bringing &apos; em home .
cheers !
to the dwarfs !
that &apos;s quite a spill . are you okay ?
i &apos;ve had worse .
a mouse .
what ? where ?
no .
i meant me .
i was a mouse .
my name was gus .
i lived in cinderella &apos;s pantry .
i ate cheese , i gnawed on wood ,
but i preferred the cheese .
and why are you telling me this ?
uh , we haven &apos;t had a chance to talk since things ... changed .
i just wanted you to know who i was ... back home .
uh , can i , um , still call you &quot; billy &quot; ?
you can call me whatever you want ,
as long as you let me buy you a drink after your shift .
i already know ruby .
i want the chance to meet red .
um , tonight &apos;s actually not great .
because--
uh , we , uh , we have , uh , plans .
that &apos;s right .
um , its girls &apos; night . i &apos;m bringing the cheese ,
which has nothing to do with you being a mouse .
it has to do with the ... wine .
okay . um ... maybe next time .
thank you .
i can spot a girl in trouble .
he--he seems really nice .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s complicated .
is that coffee ?
no .
trying to stay up , huh ?
still worried about those nightmares ?
well , don &apos;t be .
&apos;cause when you go to sleep tonight ,
i &apos;m gonna be right in the next room .
now maybe lose the java
and go grab a cocoa .
congratulations ...
sheriff .
quite a celebration .
what are you doing here ?
you may have taken care of me in the old world ,
but in this one , we get another go at each other .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
it &apos;s a big moment for you , isn &apos;t it ?
on your way to getting your family back .
yeah .
yeah , it must be hard for you ,
you know , watching good win .
good ?
so sure of yourself .
but i know the truth .
you &apos;re still just a shepherd pretending to be a prince .
you weren &apos;t fit to run the kingdom ,
and you sure as hell aren &apos;t fit to run this town .
i think the people of storybrooke might disagree with you .
today .
but i &apos;m gonna see to it that they see things my way ,
that they see you for who you really are .
by the time i &apos;m done with you ,
you &apos;ll wish you &apos;d killed me when you had the chance .
oh . the people of this town know who i really am ,
and they &apos;ve seen me defeat you before .
so if you want to try and take me down ,
they &apos;ll see it again .
almost done .
let &apos;s finish clearing out those perishables .
what the hell is this ?
we &apos;re making a cage .
know anybody who might want 38 frozen lasagnas ?
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
i know .
nobody would believe it if you told them my lasagna was frozen .
no . why are you building a cage ?
tonight &apos;s the first full moon since the curse broke .
it &apos;s the first night of wolfstime .
i thought you figured out how to control the wolf in you ages ago .
yeah , but thanks to the curse , i haven &apos;t turned in 28 years .
i might be rusty .
i can &apos;t let what happened last time--
what happened to peter-- happen to anyone else .
what about your red hood ? that could keep you from turning .
if i had it . i &apos;ve looked everywhere .
i even went to gold .
it &apos;s not in town . i don &apos;t think it came over with the curse .
ruby , i know you .
i trust you . snow trusted you .
wolfstime or not , you won &apos;t hurt anyone tonight .
maybe .
but i can &apos;t afford to take any chances .
oh , i think we lost them .
snow , wait . wait !
you can &apos;t run from the queen , snow white .
come on . there are more of them .
right this way !
up the ridge !
it &apos;s okay . they &apos;re gone .
she &apos;s never going to stop , is she ?
my hood--it &apos;s torn .
you have to go . you have to get away from me .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
there &apos;s a full moon tonight . wolfstime is beginning .
this hood is the only thing that can protect me from turning .
it &apos;s just a tear .
maybe it &apos;ll still work .
what if it doesn &apos;t ?
you saw what i did to peter .
this thing--the wolf--
when it takes over me , i can &apos;t control it .
please , snow , find shelter .
i &apos;ll go further into the woods and find a place to hide .
for your own sake , we have to split up .
all right .
just for tonight .
let &apos;s meet up in the morning by the stream ,
and then we &apos;ll find a safe place for both of us .
maybe a nice cabin in the woods .
why are you doing this ?
doing what ?
being so ... kind to me .
you saw what i did as a wolf ,
what i am .
i know that &apos;s not who you really are .
we &apos;re in this together , red .
are you awake yet , ruby ?
ruby , ruby .
ruby !
help !
help !
who are you ?
where are we ? !
henry ? henry , wake up .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re okay .
wh @-@ wh @-@ what are you doing here ? where &apos;s david ?
he got an emergency call this morning ,
and he asked me to look after you .
he told me you &apos;ve been having nightmares .
it &apos;s okay . you can--
is that a burn ?
this way .
over here .
ruby .
ruby , wake up .
where am i ? what happened ?
you &apos;re in the forest .
you must &apos;ve fallen asleep here last night .
i don &apos;t understand . you put me in that cage . you locked me up .
the freezer was torn to shreds
when i came to check in on you this morning .
ruby . ruby , it &apos;s all right .
no . it &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t remember anything from last night .
this is exactly what i was afraid of .
oh , my god . did i do something last night ?
ruby , all we know for sure is that
you broke out and ran through the woods .
there &apos;s no reason to assume the worst .
sheriff .
yeah .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
what is it ?
somebody left their car double @-@ parked in front of the cannery .
i gotta go check it out on our way back into town .
hey . relax .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
it worked .
looking for this ?
no . don &apos;t . please .
i need that .
this old thing ?
just
what could you possibly need this for ?
drop it !
unless ...
it protects you from something .
what are you talking about ?
you think i don &apos;t know a wolf when i see one ?
how do you know what i am ?
because i know how to recognize a child of the moon .
you-- you &apos;re one , too ?
name &apos;s quinn .
i picked up on your scent last night .
you never had anyone talk to you about this , did you ?
teach you about what you are ?
my parents were killed by hunters when i was a baby .
i was raised by my granny .
and she kept the truth from you .
made you wear that .
still blacking out , right ?
still losing control when you turn ?
probably even hurt someone .
i know how you feel .
i &apos;ve been there .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
what do you mean ?
what if i told you there was a way to control it
so you never have to be afraid of what you might do again ?
is that possible ?
follow me .
is this some kind of trick ?
used to be the grand hall of a castle ,
until it sunk underground .
now it &apos;s all ours .
are they ...
yes .
we are all the same .
come . anita is expecting you .
wh @-@ who &apos;s anita ?
that would be me .
well done , quinn .
you finally found her .
you &apos;ve grown so much .
you know me ?
i &apos;m your mother .
that &apos;s billy &apos;s truck .
great .
who do i call to tow a tow truck ?
what is it , ruby ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i smell blood .
where &apos;s billy ?
here .
oh ! it was the wolf !
it was me !
oh , yes .
you were quite right to call me .
so y @-@ you can help ?
it was just a dream .
well , what you &apos;re describing &apos;s certainly not a dream .
then what was it ?
a side effect .
you know , it &apos;s remarkable you &apos;d cast a curse
you know so little about .
my victims are not supposed to wake up .
so i certainly never cared what happened to them after .
until now .
when people fall under a sleeping curse ,
the soul travels to a netherworld
where it resides until awoken .
now this world is between life and death ,
and it &apos;s very real .
however ...
even when the curse is broken ,
sometimes in sleep ,
the victims find their way back to that world--
victims like you .
this other world is tormenting my son every time he sleeps .
i want you to give him something
that will keep him from going there .
well , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not possible .
i can , however , provide you with something
that will allow him to control his actions
whilst in that world .
and once one controls something ,
one no longer need fear it .
a necklace ?
you wear this while you &apos;re sleeping .
once you control the journey ,
the fear will stop .
and then you can come and go as you please .
everything comes at a price with you .
what do you want for this ?
for a house call ?
you couldn &apos;t afford it .
but this is for henry .
this one &apos;s on me .
it had to be something else , ruby .
no , i did this ! we both know it .
no . a few months ago ,
everyone thought mary margaret was guilty of murder .
she needed someone to believe in her . i didn &apos;t do that .
i am not gonna make the same mistake with you .
mary margaret never killed anyone .
i have .
i know who you really are , ruby ,
even if you &apos;ve lost sight of it .
it doesn &apos;t change the fact that i am gonna turn again tonight ,
and somebody else could get hurt .
maybe this isn &apos;t the place to have this discussion .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll protect her .
no !
lock me up .
if the freezer couldn &apos;t hold me , maybe a jail cell will .
i don &apos;t need to be protected from other people , david .
other people need to be protected from me .
granny lied to me .
that story about you being killed by hunters ...
she &apos;s been lying to you ever since she stole you away from me
when you were just a baby .
why would she do that ?
because she didn &apos;t want you to find out the truth about who you really are .
she believed the wolf is something to be ashamed of .
i see things differently .
humans want us to believe we &apos;re the monsters .
the moment you believe them--
that &apos;s when you become one .
you &apos;re not the first
to learn the truth about yourself through tragedy .
so many of us spent so much of our life suppressing the wolf .
they have no idea how to control it .
they just need help--
help embracing their true nature .
the only way you will ever control the wolf
is by accepting it as a part of you .
you can teach me to do that ?
indeed i can .
how ?
you can start by getting rid of that .
you &apos;ll be safe in here tonight .
thank you , david .
thank me in the morning .
by then , i &apos;ll have found whoever really killed billy .
you already have .
that thing . that she @-@ wolf .
get out .
whatever issues you have with me don &apos;t involve her .
there &apos;s no proof ruby had anything to do with what happened .
it seems to me
that you &apos;re allowing your emotions to cloud your judgment .
leave him alone .
protecting your friend at the peril of everyone else .
i knew you &apos;d slip up , shepherd .
it was only a matter of time .
what do you want ?
justice .
hand that over to me and let the town decide her fate .
never . i know exactly what kind of justice you have in mind .
this town is bigger than you think .
i start telling people that you &apos;re putting their lives
in danger to protect your own interests ,
you &apos;ll have a mutiny on your hands .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
you want her ,
you have to go through me .
i look forward to that .
it &apos;ll be like nothing you &apos;ve ever felt before--
the pine needles underfoot ,
the air rushing over your fur ,
your brothers and sisters at your side .
your mind won &apos;t want to believe it .
it will tell you a wolf is invading your body ,
trying to take over ,
and if you believe that , for even a moment ,
you &apos;ll black out ...
and lose control ,
like you have every other night you &apos;ve turned .
but if you give in to the wolf ,
you &apos;ll realize the truth .
you are the wolf .
and when you accept that ,
you will finally be in control .
how much do you remember ?
all of it .
you finally became the wolf .
i don &apos;t have to be afraid anymore .
we won &apos;t cower in fear of this creature any longer !
we know who she is . we know where she &apos;s hiding .
so why is she still alive ?
because she &apos;s being harbored by one person--
david nolan .
how many more people have to die
before our prince decides to act ?
yeah !
if he won &apos;t protect you , i will .
yeah .
these should work .
thanks for letting her hide here .
the sheriff &apos;s station isn &apos;t safe .
of course .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s not every day you find out your friend &apos;s--
a monster ?
hunted .
i was going to say &quot; hunted . &quot;
the crowd &apos;s six blocks from here .
you-- you have wolf hearing , too ?
it &apos;s not all it &apos;s cracked up to be ,
especially when you run a hotel .
the only way we &apos;re gonna get the mob to stand down
is if we prove ruby had nothing to do with billy &apos;s death .
i &apos;m gonna need your help .
if the mob comes this way , call us . come on .
what is it ?
hunters .
no ! don &apos;t ! she &apos;s not here to hurt us !
what other reason do humans have for entering our den ?
she &apos;s a friend
who stood by me after she learned the truth , after i killed .
without her , i never would &apos;ve escaped my village alive !
let her go .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , snow !
when you didn &apos;t show up at the stream this morning ,
i thought the queen &apos;s men had killed you .
so ...
who are your friends ?
we &apos;re her pack .
are they--
yes . they &apos;re like me .
but you don &apos;t have to fear them .
of course not .
how did you find us ?
i tracked wolf prints here , like you taught me .
you could &apos;ve been caught by the queen &apos;s men .
i wasn &apos;t going to leave without you .
why don &apos;t we go find that cabin we talked about , okay ?
you &apos;re not coming with me , are you ?
i don &apos;t have to be ashamed of who i am here .
i found my home .
i found my mother .
but i thought--
granny lied .
i &apos;m sorry , snow .
i know you risked your life to come back here for me .
no . i understand .
i would do anything to be with my mother again .
i know we planned on leaving the kingdom together .
i &apos;ll be all right .
you &apos;ve taught me enough already . i &apos;ll manage .
bye , red . thank you .
no , thank you .
quinn !
they found me .
stand down or die at the hands of the--
quinn , no .
he &apos;s gone .
you need to leave . the moon &apos;s gonna be up soon .
but will the chains hold ?
hopefully .
then i &apos;m staying .
think of it as girls &apos; night .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i know david wants to believe the best ,
but i &apos;ve killed before , and i &apos;ll do it again .
everyone in this town is right to be afraid of me .
okay , well , i &apos;m not .
you should be .
no matter what you might &apos;ve done in your past ,
david sees the good in you , and ...
and that tells me one thing .
what ?
that it &apos;s in there .
so if we can all see it , why can &apos;t you ?
you really think so ?
trust me . i &apos;m sort of an expert when it comes to rehabilitation .
maybe .
maybe you &apos;re right .
but the town &apos;s right , too . i am a monster ,
and that &apos;s why i need to make sure i don &apos;t ever hurt anyone again .
no . no . wh @-@ what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t let you stop me .
the mobs wants a wolf . i &apos;m gonna give them one .
i need to pay for all i &apos;ve done .
they &apos;ll kill you .
isn &apos;t that what i deserve ?
this way .
the trunk .
the wolf didn &apos;t kill billy .
ruby &apos;s hood .
so she &apos;d be forced to change back into a wolf .
so whoever killed billy could pin the murder on her .
who would want to hurt my ruby ?
this isn &apos;t about ruby . it &apos;s about me .
spencer .
king george ?
he needed a reason to wrestle power away from me ,
so he created one .
she &apos;s out .
the mob . they &apos;re gonna kill her .
may you always run free beneath the moon &apos;s pale light .
red , i &apos;m so sorry .
you .
you did this .
what ? no .
you brought the queen &apos;s men into our den .
you have to believe me . i had no idea they followed me .
mother , she didn &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
wherever humans go , death follows .
the only way to stop them is to kill them first .
tie her up .
no .
when the moon rises , we &apos;ll feast on a princess .
what are you doing ?
she &apos;ll pay for the life that we lost .
mother , you &apos;re not making any sense .
you already made your choice , red .
you &apos;re one of us now . act like it .
kill her .
no .
i won &apos;t kill my friend .
then i will .
no . mother , stop !
sorry , my daughter .
this is what it means to be a wolf .
please .
red !
i didn &apos;t mean to .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , mother .
you chose her .
no .
i chose me .
i &apos;m not a killer .
she &apos;s close .
there you are .
the next one goes between your eyes !
ruby !
why are you protecting her ?
we &apos;re not sheep , david !
we don &apos;t need to be led by a shepherd !
listen to me ! ruby didn &apos;t kill billy .
he did .
he stole her cloak
and killed billy in cold blood to make it look like a wolf ,
all to get you to think i wasn &apos;t leading this town as i should .
hold up !
somebody already died because of what this man did .
let &apos;s not spill more blood . she won &apos;t hurt anyone .
she &apos;s just scared .
ruby ?
i know you &apos;re in there , so listen to me .
it was spencer , not you .
don &apos;t let him trick you into thinking you &apos;re a monster .
all right .
all right . poor ...
poor choice of words .
please .
ruby .
i know you .
i know the real you ,
and i know you can control the wolf .
ruby .
ruby ?
ruby .
it &apos;s me .
david .
you saved me .
no . you saved yourself .
i just reminded you of what you already knew .
what happened ?
where &apos;s spencer ?
he &apos;s gone .
go . go .
okay .
you think you can hide from a wolf ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to hide .
you killed an innocent man .
he was a mouse .
he was better than you &apos;ll ever be .
you want to make a deal ? it &apos;s not gonna happen .
i &apos;m not interested in making a deal .
i just want to see the look on your face when you realize something .
what &apos;s that ?
that you &apos;re never gonna see your wife or your daughter again .
what are you talking about ?
you really should be more cautious
with something so valuable .
no ! no .
it doesn &apos;t matter how much fairy dust you gather ...
no !
or how much you rally the town behind you .
your family &apos;s gone .
david , don &apos;t .
i told you ,
you should &apos;ve killed me when you had the chance .
may you always run free beneath the moon &apos;s pale light .
good @-@ bye , mother .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know what it &apos;s like to lose your family .
i didn &apos;t lose my family today .
i protected it .
thank you .
my mother wanted me to choose between being a wolf and being a human .
granny did , too .
you are the only person who ever thought it was okay for me to be both .
&apos;cause that &apos;s who you are .
come on .
let &apos;s go find the cabin .
he may never see his mother or grandmother again .
how am i gonna break that news to him ?
you won &apos;t have to .
travel between worlds is as hard as it comes .
fairy dust on its own isn &apos;t enough .
it took an entire curse to get us here in the first place .
without the hat--
you &apos;ll find another way .
you don &apos;t know that .
but i know you ,
and i know you &apos;ll never give up until you do .
and , david ,
you &apos;re not gonna be doing this alone .
thank you .
do you mind giving granny a call ?
sure . why ? what for ?
i may have left belle chained up in the library .
somebody should probably--
unchain her ?
yeah .
yeah . i &apos;ll take care of it .
where you going ?
i &apos;ve still got a few hours of wolfstime left .
you helped me regain control .
i want to do something i haven &apos;t done in a very long time .
what &apos;s that ?
run .
what are you doing ?
uh , just thinking .
come on . mulan has some ideas where cora might be hiding .
wait .
don &apos;t be scared .
snow ! snow !
hey . i &apos;m here . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just another nightmare .
no , this time , it was different . there was a little boy . he ...
he put out the fire . he talked to me .
a little boy ?
what &apos;d he say ?
he said ...
