so how was joan ?
broke up with her .
oh , why ?
don &apos;t tell me . because of the big nostril thing ?
they were huge !
when she sneezed , bats flew out of them .
they were not that huge .
i &apos;m telling you , she leaned back , i could see her brain .
how many women will you reject ...
... over superficial , insignificant things
hold it . i gotta side with chandler on this one .
when i first moved here , i went out with this girl .
really hot . great kisser ...
... but she had the biggest adam &apos;s apple .
drove me nuts .
you or me ?
i got it .
joey , women don &apos;t have adam &apos;s apples .
you guys are messing with me , right ?
yeah . we are !
that &apos;s a good one . for a second there , i was like , whoa !
you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason .
maureen rasillo .
because she doesn &apos;t hate yanni is not a real reason .
hello , mr. heckles .
you &apos;re doing it again .
we &apos;re not doing anything .
you &apos;re stomping . it &apos;s disturbing my birds .
you don &apos;t have birds .
i could have birds .
we &apos;ll try to keep it down .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to rejoin my dinner party .
all right , bye @-@ bye .
okay , janice .
give me janice . that wasn &apos;t about being picky .
we &apos;ll give you janice .
i miss janice , though .
hello , chandler bing !
oh , my god !
oh , chandler !
now ! now !
that &apos;s it .
there ! faster !
stop with the broom ! we &apos;re not making noise !
we won .
we did it !
mr. heckles !
how did this happen ?
he was sweeping .
they found a broom in his hand .
that &apos;s terrible .
i know .
i was sweeping yesterday .
it could &apos;ve been me .
sweeping . you never know .
never know .
it &apos;s very faint , but i can still sense him in the building .
go into the light , mr. heckles !
okay , phoebe .
i &apos;m sorry , but sometimes they need help .
here we go .
that &apos;s fine , go ahead and scoff .
there are a lot of things i don &apos;t believe in ...
... but that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re not true .
such as ?
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution .
what , you don &apos;t believe in evolution ?
not really .
you don &apos;t believe in evolution ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just , you know ....
monkeys , darwin , it &apos;s a nice story . i just think it &apos;s a little too easy .
&quot; too easy &quot; ? too
the process of every living thing on this planet evolving ...
... over millions of years from single @-@ celled organisms is &quot; too easy &quot; ?
yeah , i just don &apos;t buy it .
excuse me . evolution is not for you to buy , phoebe .
evolution is scientific fact , like the air we breathe ...
... iike gravity .
don &apos;t get me started on gravity .
you don &apos;t believe in gravity ?
well , it &apos;s not so much that , you know , i don &apos;t believe in it .
lately i get the feeling that ...
... i &apos;m not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed .
pushed .
it &apos;s lsaac newton and he &apos;s pissed .
quick , pheebs , hop on the ceiling .
there she is . and over there , that &apos;s the other one .
this is mr. buddy doyle , heckles &apos; attorney .
he &apos;d like to talk to you .
what can we do for you ?
all right , kids , here &apos;s the deal .
according my client &apos;s will ...
... he wants to leave all his earthly possessions ...
... to &quot; the noisy girls in the apartment above mine . &quot;
what about his family ?
he didn &apos;t have any .
okay , so let &apos;s talk money .
all right , there was none .
now , let &apos;s talk signing .
you be noisy girl number one . you be noisy girl number two .
i can &apos;t believe that this whole time we thought he hated us .
isn &apos;t it amazing how much you can touch someone &apos;s life ...
... without even knowing it ?
would you look at this dump ?
he hated us ! this was his final revenge !
i &apos;ve never seen so much crap !
actually , i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap .
check this out .
can i have this ?
how can you not believe in evolution ?
i don &apos;t know , just don &apos;t . look at this funky shirt !
pheebs , i &apos;ve studied evolution my entire adult life .
and we &apos;ve collected fossils from all over the world ...
... that actually show the evolution of different species .
i mean , you can literally see them ...
... evolving through time .
really ? you can actually see it ?
you bet ! in the u.s. , china , africa , all over !
see , i didn &apos;t know that .
well , there you go .
so now the real question is , who put those fossils there and why ?
look at this ! my big book of grievances .
hey , there &apos;s me !
&quot; april 1.7th , excessive noise ...
... italian guy comes home with a date . &quot;
you &apos;re in here too .
&quot; april 1.8th , excessive noise ...
... italian guy &apos;s gay roommate brings home dry cleaning . &quot;
well , that &apos;s excellent .
look at this lamp .
is this tacky or what ? we have to have this .
i think we have enough regular lamps .
what ? come on , it &apos;s not like ...
... i &apos;m asking for this girlie clock or anything .
which , by the way , i also think is really cool .
look , it doesn &apos;t go with any of my stuff .
well , what about my stuff ?
you don &apos;t have any stuff .
it will be the start of my stuff .
no .
you still think of it as your apartment , don &apos;t you ?
yes , you do .
you think of it as your apartment and i just rent a room .
while you &quot; mmm &quot; on that , i &apos;ll go find a place for my new lamp .
okay , pheebs . see how i &apos;m making these little toys move ?
opposable thumbs !
without evolution , how do you explain opposable thumbs ?
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts .
tell me you &apos;re joking .
look , can &apos;t we say that you believe in something and i don &apos;t ?
no , pheebs , we can &apos;t . because it &apos;s like math . one plus one equals two .
i can &apos;t let you think that it might equal three or four or yellow .
why not ? . no , what is that all about ? .
what is this obsessive need to make everybody agree with you ?
you know what ?
i think maybe it &apos;s time you put ross under the microscope .
is there blood coming out of my ears ?
check it out . heckles &apos; high @-@ school yearbook .
he looks so normal !
he &apos;s even kind of cute .
&quot; heckles , you crack me up in science class .
you &apos;re the funniest kid in school . &quot;
funniest ? heckles ?
that &apos;s what it says .
heckles was voted class clown , and so was l .
he was right ! would you listen to that ?
i &apos;d call that excessive .
what ?
heckles played clarinet in band , and i played clarinet .
he was in the scale modeler &apos;s club and i was
there was no club , but i sure thought they were cool .
so ? you were both dorks .
big deal .
i just think it &apos;s weird , you know ? heckles and me
heckles and me . me
me and heckles .
hey , would you knock it off !
have you been here all night ?
look at this .
pictures of all the women heckles went out with .
look what he wrote on them . &quot; vivian , too tall . &quot;
&quot; madge , big gums . &quot;
&quot; too loud . &quot;
&quot; too smart . &quot; &quot; makes noise when she eats . &quot;
this is me .
this is what i do .
i &apos;m gonna end up alone , just like he did .
heckles was a nut case .
our trains are on the same track .
i &apos;m coming up 30 years behind him , but the stops are all the same .
bitter town ...
... alone @-@ ville , hermit junction !
you know what we gotta do ? get you out of here .
i &apos;ll buy you breakfast .
what if i never find somebody ? or worse , what if i found her ...
... but i dumped her because she pronounces it , &quot; supposably &quot; ?
chandler , come on , you &apos;re gonna find somebody .
how do you know that ? how ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m just trying to help you out .
you guys will all get married ...
... and i &apos;ll end up alone .
will you promise me something ?
when you &apos;re married , will you invite me over for holidays ?
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;ll be doing .
i mean , what if we &apos;re over at her folks &apos; place ?
yeah , i understand .
you can come over and watch the super bowl .
every year , all right ?
you know what ? i &apos;m not gonna end up like this .
i &apos;ll see you , man .
&quot; supposably . &quot;
supposably !
did they go to the zoo ?
supposably .
hi . it &apos;s me .
oh , my god !
janice ? you called janice ?
yes . janice .
why is that difficult to comprehend ?
you remember janice , right ?
yes . she was smart , she was pretty and she honestly cared about me .
janice is my last chance to have somebody .
oh , my god !
jeez , look how fat she got .
hey , it &apos;s everybody !
hi , janice .
janice , you &apos;re ....
yes , i am .
ls it ?
ls it yours ?

you are looking at a married lady now .
congratulations .
sweetie , i &apos;m sorry.i couldn &apos;t wait for you forever .
you couldn &apos;t tell me on the phone ?
and what ? miss the expression on your face ? oh , no !
janice likes to have her fun !
you know what we haven &apos;t played in a while ?
hide the lamp .
monica , let it go .
did you know i &apos;m allergic to shellfish ?
then you &apos;ll just have to eat the other lamps .
it &apos;s scary scientist man .
okay , phoebe , this is it .
in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts .
a briefcase of facts , if you will .
some of these fossils are over 200 million years old .
before you even start , i &apos;m not denying evolution .
it &apos;s just one of the possibilities .
it &apos;s the only possibility .
ross , could you just open your mind , like , this much ?
didn &apos;t the brightest minds in the world believe the earth was flat ?
and up till 50 years ago , you thought the atom was the smallest thing ...
... until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out .
are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant ...
... that you can &apos;t admit that there &apos;s a teeny , tiny possibility ...
... that you could be wrong about this ?
there might be ...
... a teeny ...
... tiny ...
... possibility .
i can &apos;t believe you caved .
you just abandoned your whole belief system !
before , i didn &apos;t agree with you , but at least i respected you .
but ....
how are you gonna go into work tomorrow ?
how are you going to face the other science guys ?
how are you going to face yourself ?
that was fun . so who &apos;s hungry ?
i am .
me too . let me just get my coat .
what happened ?
it was an accident , i swear .
i was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke .
oh , please , monica ! you &apos;ve always hated my lamp !
and now all of a sudden , it &apos;s just magically , it &apos;s just broken ?
phoebe , tell her ?
i didn &apos;t see it , because i was putting on my jacket .
but i want to believe you .
hey , chandler . monica just broke my seashell lamp .
neat .
i &apos;m gonna die alone !
okay , you win .
chandler , you are not gonna die alone .
janice was my safety net , okay ?
and now i have to get a snake .
why is that ?
if i &apos;m gonna be an old , lonely man , i &apos;m gonna need a thing .
you know , a hook .
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face .
so i figure i &apos;ll be &quot; crazy man with a snake . &quot;
crazy snake man .
then i &apos;ll get more snakes , call them my babies .
kids will run past my place !
&quot; run away from crazy snake man , &quot; they &apos;ll shout !
you &apos;ve got to get over this .
you won &apos;t end up alone .
of course i will .
i reject anyone who &apos;s crazy enough to actually go out with me ...
... and then i bitch that there aren &apos;t any great women out there .
you have just described ...
... virtually every man that we &apos;ve ever gone out with .
you are not a freak . you &apos;re a guy .
she &apos;s right.you all do it .
this one guy stopped seeing me because his cat didn &apos;t like me .
or because i fell asleep during spinal tap ,
you fell asleep during spinal tap ? .
teddy , who stopped seeing you because you were too fat .
he said he didn &apos;t have time for me because of the play .
that &apos;s what i said .
my point being , you are no different than the rest .
wait a minute , wait a minute . yes , he is .
you are totally different .
in a bad way ?
no , honey , in a wonderful way .
you know what you want now .
most guys don &apos;t even have a clue .
you &apos;re ready to take risks , be vulnerable and intimate with someone .
you &apos;re not gonna end up alone .
you called janice . that &apos;s how much you wanted to be with someone !
you &apos;ve made it !
you &apos;re there !
you are ready to make a commitment !
don &apos;t know about that !
what you got there ?
something else that &apos;s not yours that you can break ?
i know you like this and i want you to have it .
it &apos;ll look good in our apartment .
thank you .
that &apos;s fine .
you &apos;ll all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night .
this woman allison from work . she is great .
she &apos;s pretty , she &apos;s smart . and i &apos;ve been ...
... holding off asking her out in the past , because she has a ...
... unusually large head .
but i &apos;m not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore .
look at me . i &apos;m growing .
you can &apos;t recycle yearbooks , can you ?
i &apos;ll take that .
you want his yearbook ?
some people said nice things about him . somebody should have it .
gosh , this is so weird .
his whole life was in this apartment and now it &apos;s gone .
i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for mr. heckles .
he was kind of a pain . he was , but he was a person .
you &apos;re all going to hell .
it &apos;s really not that big !
taking that with you , huh ?
oh , yeah .
you coming ?
in a second .
goodbye , mr. heckles .
we &apos;ll try to keep it down .
my major was useless .
how often do you look in the classifieds and see &quot; philosopher wanted &quot; ?
sure .
my god , that &apos;s a big head !
it didn &apos;t look this big in the office . maybe it &apos;s the lighting .
my head must look like a golf ball at work .
don &apos;t get hung up on it . quick ! list five things you like about her .
nice smile , good dresser .
