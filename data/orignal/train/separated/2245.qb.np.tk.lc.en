no one ...
is getting through that .
when are you installing the torture chamber ?
you don &apos;t like it ? i call it medieval chic .
i don &apos;t care what it looks like
as long as it keeps regina and her skeleton keys out .
you &apos;re pretty handy for a writer .
where &apos;d you learn how to do all this ?
wood shop . eighth grade .
oh , speaking of school , have to get going .
um , are you sure you &apos;re ready to go back ?
after a stint behind bars ,
how tough can a room full of fourth graders be ?
besides , aren &apos;t you the one we need to be worried about ?
me ? why ?
you did threaten to take henry away from regina .
oh , that wasn &apos;t a threat .
i &apos;m hiring mr. gold to help build a case against her .
she tried to frame you for murder .
but you do know what happens if you win ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re ready ?
to be his mom ?
yeah .
code red . code red .
hey , henry . what &apos;s going on ?
meet me at granny &apos;s . it &apos;s an operation cobra emergency .
i &apos;m on my way .
emma , wait up .
you heard the kid . operation cobra calls .
i didn &apos;t think you believed any of that .
oh , i don &apos;t , but sometimes it &apos;s the only way
to get through to henry .
you know , a custody battle against regina
isn &apos;t going to accomplish anything .
you need to look at the big picture .
that &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna understand what you &apos;re up against .
that &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll know how to beat regina .
okay , new guy , how &apos;s that ?
take the day off .
come with me , and i &apos;ll show you .
and where exactly would we be going
on this magical mystery tour ?
if i told you , you would never come .
oh , come on . take a leap of faith .
you come with me , and i promise you ,
you &apos;ll find exactly what you &apos;re looking for .
my kid needs me . i don &apos;t have time for faith .
hey . what &apos;s the emergency ?
this is sensitive .
if it &apos;s sensitive ,
why are we at granny &apos;s , out in the open ?
i &apos;m hungry .
who else knows that we hide the book at the sheriff &apos;s station ?
no one . why ?
someone changed it .
there &apos;s a new story in it .
why would someone add a new story ?
to tell something we need to know about the curse .
and what would that be ?
i don &apos;t know . the story isn &apos;t finished .
why would someone go to so much trouble to add a new story
and then not bother finishing it ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s weird .
the story &apos;s about pinocchio .
everyone knows how that ends .
well , maybe that &apos;s why it was left out .
or maybe there &apos;s more to it .
henry , you are gonna be late for school .
let &apos;s go .
hold on , my boy !
i &apos;m trying , father !
faster , father ! faster ! he &apos;s catching up !
the current-- it &apos;s too strong !
don &apos;t let go !
what is it ?
we must abandon ship .
take this .
this is the only one .
no , father . i &apos;m made of wood . i &apos;ll float .
we can both survive .
no . we don &apos;t risk .
take !
no , father ! you take it !
save yourself !
pinocchio !
pinocchio ?
pinocchio ?
you saved me .
where are you ?
where are you ?
oh , no .
no . no .
no .
no .
i wish i could &apos;ve saved you , my boy .
we still can .
please .
save him .
father ?
pinocchio ...
look .
i &apos;m ...
a real boy .
i &apos;m a real boy !
thank you .
i don &apos;t know how i can ever repay you . th--
this is all i @-@ i ever wanted .
you and pinocchio have found each other .
now go . live your life together as a family .
come , my son .
remember , pinocchio ,
be brave , truthful , and unselfish .
so long as you do that , you will always remain a real boy .
mr. gold ?
we need to meet . it &apos;s about emma .
there &apos;s a ... problem .
ms. blanchard .
i see you &apos;re back .
yes .
isn &apos;t it wonderful ? everything worked out .
henry forgot his lunch . have you seen him ?
he &apos;s with his mother .
ms. blanchard , is there a problem ?
not anymore .
though someone did go to a lot of trouble to make it look like
i had done something horrible .
but they failed .
yes . sidney glass ,
who &apos;s safely incarcerated .
if it was sidney .
well , ask your roommate . he confessed .
of course he did .
are you insinuating something ?
yes , i am .
but i forgive you .
even if you can &apos;t admit what you did ,
i forgive you anyway .
your life must be filled with such incredible loneliness
if your only joy comes from destroying everyone else &apos;s happiness .
it &apos;s so sad , mayor mills ,
because despite what you think ,
it won &apos;t make you happy .
it &apos;s only going to leave a giant hole in your heart .
there &apos;s henry now .
what are you doing here ?
you forgot your lunchbox .
thanks .
henry , it &apos;s time for a change .
i think it &apos;s time to transfer you to a new class with a new teacher .
why do you want me out of ms. blanchard &apos;s class ?
is it because you framed her ?
henry !
do you really think i &apos;m capable of doing something so horrible ?
of course . you &apos;re the evil queen .
enough .
those fairy tales are not real .
ms. blanchard should never have given you that book .
she should be grateful i &apos;m not trying to get her fired .
go ahead and try . it won &apos;t work .
no matter what you do ,
snow white will have her happy ending .
she and prince charming will be together .
the curse will end .
good will win .
and i &apos;m not transferring classes .
ah , mr. booth . i &apos;ll be with you in a moment .
on second thought , tell me--
as one admirer of antiquities to another--
do you think it &apos;s worth my while having this clock repaired ?
i &apos;ll take your silence as a &quot; yes , &quot; then .
you know , i &apos;m very busy right now ,
and , uh , i &apos;m just a one @-@ man shop .
but , uh , i &apos;ll get to the clock as fast as i can .
i wouldn &apos;t ask for anything more .
good day .
h @-@ how are you ?
first time seeing dear old dad since you arrived at storybrooke ?
i &apos;m s @-@ sor--
you know , what surprises me is
why a man who claims to be at death &apos;s door
can &apos;t even bring himself to say hello to his father .
what are you afraid of ?
that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s my business .
fair enough .
let &apos;s talk about ours .
you claim to be the only person who can make ms. swan believe ,
that you could get her to do
exactly what she was brought here to do , and yet ,
for a man who &apos;s running out of time ,
you don &apos;t seem to be in much of a hurry .
it &apos;s not me slowing us down .
it &apos;s her . all she can think about right now
is getting custody of her kid .
sounds like sheriff swan needs a course correction .
she &apos;s coming to you for legal advice .
and you want me to steer her toward you .
i can get her there , to believing .
trust me .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just that knowing who you are
and your nature ,
trust is a big ask .
fear not .
a gentle nudge i shall provide .
align the gear on the spindle .
now press the spring .
good work !
you fixed it , eh ? bravo !
did you do this , pinocchio ?
remember what the blue fairy told you
about being a good boy ?
thanks .
oh , it &apos;s okay . he meant no harm .
i &apos;d be laughing , too , if ...
oh , i felt so dizzy .
i &apos;m sorry .
i meant to be good .
i &apos;m not here because of you , pinocchio .
i &apos;m afraid i bring bad news .
wait in your room , my boy . go on .
h @-@ hang on , pinocchio . i &apos;ll come with you .
what is it ?
the evil queen--
she &apos;s threatened the entire kingdom with a curse ,
a curse that will rip away all that we love .
then we must stop her .
it &apos;s too late for that .
so all is lost ?
no . there is hope ,
if you will help us .
me ?
snow white is about to give birth to a child--
a child who will save us all when she reaches her 28th year--
but only if she can be protected
from the powerful effects of the dark curse .
but how can i protect this child ?
there is an enchanted tree ,
much like the one you carved pinocchio from .
if fashioned into a vessel ,
it can protect the child from the queen &apos;s magic .
will you do this ?
i cannot lose my boy .
i have lost ...
so much .
i cannot lose him , too .
then build the wardrobe .
that &apos;s how you will save us all .
i have to save him .
i have to get henry away from regina .
i must admit , your intentions are admirable .
however ,
i won &apos;t be taking your case .
what ?
you know what regina did .
yes , but we can &apos;t prove it .
and given the mayor &apos;s sway in this town ,
any proceedings against her
would be long and drawn out and futile .
the only certainty is henry would suffer .
you can &apos;t do that to your boy .
so we leave him in the same house with that sociopath ?
i &apos;m sorry , sheriff . my mind &apos;s made up .
well , then change it .
the only person i &apos;ve ever seen
go head @-@ to @-@ head with regina and win is you .
that &apos;s because i know how to pick my battles .
then pick this one .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m just simply
not the man to help you beat mayor mills .
no . you &apos;re not .
emma .
take it easy .
is everything okay ?
no . i am just about out options .
&quot; just about &quot; ?
you told me to beat regina , i need to see the big picture .
show it to me .
car trouble ?
it won &apos;t start .
i &apos;ve got a car full of groceries ,
and well , it hasn &apos;t exactly been a banner day .
let &apos;s see .
your battery &apos;s dead .
what ?
i don &apos;t have any jumper cables ,
but i can give you a ride home in my truck .
oh , no , no . thank you , but i couldn &apos;t impose .
i insist ,
unless you want to have a car full of melted rocky road .
sure .
thank you for being my knight in shining armor .
well , it &apos;s more like flannel ,
but you &apos;re welcome .
hey , why don &apos;t you stay for dinner ?
i bought more than enough for me and henry ,
and ...
well , i &apos;m making lasagna .
oh , i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s getting late ,
and i &apos;ve gotta get up early tomorrow for work .
of course .
oh , you can just set the bags over there .
what is it ?
henry .
he &apos;s having dinner with archie after his session
instead of coming home .
i &apos;m sorry .
lately it seems like he &apos;ll do anything
to avoid spending time with me .
but i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t be burdening you with my problems .
you &apos;ve already helped me more than enough for one day .
thank you .
you know what ?
i do love lasagna .
the evil queen will stop at nothing
to destroy snow white and prince charming &apos;s happiness .
so we must stop at nothing to undo her curse .
it &apos;s beautiful .
this is the last enchanted tree in the entire realm .
it can be done .
i could make a beautiful wardrobe out of this .
the tree contains enough magic
to protect two from the queen &apos;s curse .
before the curse strikes ,
before snow gives birth to her child ,
she and the prince will enter the wardrobe
and travel to a distant land ,
a land without magic ,
where snow will give birth to her child .
then when she reaches her 28th year ,
she can begin the battle that will defeat the evil queen .
you see why it is vital that you complete the task at hand ?
pinocchio wasn &apos;t always a real boy .
when the curse strikes ,
when the things we love are ripped away ,
he will be turned back into wood again , won &apos;t he ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s impossible to say .
uh ... you &apos;re frightening the boy .
oh , no . shh .
i will build your wardrobe ,
on one condition ...
if pinocchio can take the second spot in it .
you can &apos;t bargain like this ,
not when the entire realm is in danger .
if i don &apos;t , i will lose my boy ,
maybe forever . i @-@ i can &apos;t risk that .
snow can raise the child without her husband .
geppetto , think about
the example you &apos;re setting for pinocchio .
you may be a conscience ,
but you have not earned the right to tell me what to do .
please .
i &apos;m only trying to help .
help ?
help , like you &quot; helped &quot; my parents ?
your debt to me can never be fulfilled .
but a start would be staying out of this .
understand ?
yes .
good .
hey . hey . here .
here , boy .
pinocchio goes through ...
or no one does .
and what will we tell the prince and snow white ?
you will tell them that the tree
contains enough magic to protect only one .
do we have a deal ...
or no ?
the tree is enchanted .
if fashioned into a vessel , it can ward off any curse .
geppetto ,
can you build such a thing ?
me and my boy-- we can do it .
this will work .
we all must have faith .
there is , however , a catch .
the enchantment is indeed powerful ,
but all power has its limits .
and this tree can protect only one .
a choice must be made .
august , you gonna tell me
where we &apos;re going and how it &apos;s gonna help me beat regina ?
we &apos;re going on a trip , emma ,
so i can tell you somebody &apos;s story .
whose story ?
mine .
how did you like it ?
best lasagna i ever had .
you really know how to work some magic .
here . let me get the dishes .
oh , no , david .
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s the least i can do .
you saved me from having to call the truck today
and now you &apos;re doing my dishes .
it doesn &apos;t seem right .
please .
the last couple of weeks haven &apos;t exactly been easy for me ,
and you &apos;ve been there the whole time .
well , i can &apos;t help it . i feel responsible for you ,
ever since i ... found you .
you know , after all this time ,
no one &apos;s ever told me the story .
what story ?
about how you found me .
that &apos;s probably because i &apos;m the only one who knows it .
i was working late .
it--it was a cold night . must &apos;ve been 10 below .
and on my drive home ,
i realized i left my phone at the office .
i remember thinking just to forget about it
and i didn &apos;t really need it ,
but ... something inside me told me to turn around and go back .
and that &apos;s when you saw me ?
you were on the side of the road ,
unconscious ...
so cold you felt like ice .
the doctor said if i found you ten minutes later ,
it would &apos;ve been too late .
it &apos;s amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
if i hadn &apos;t forgotten my phone ,
i wouldn &apos;t have been on the road at that time .
yeah , it &apos;s almost ...
almost like the universe wanted you to find me .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i hope you didn &apos;t get the wrong idea .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i just got caught up in the moment .
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
i just--we ...
this is great like it is .
thanks again for dinner .
doc , do something .
it &apos;s going to be okay . the wardrobe &apos;s almost finished .
just ... just hold on .
circumstances have changed .
what do you mean , &quot; changed &quot; ?
snow white is going to give birth early .
the savior will be born at any moment .
pinocchio can &apos;t go .
snow white must accompany her daughter or all will be lost .
she must be protected .
this is a land with no magic .
she will need someone to guide her ,
someone to make her believe in her destiny .
who better than her mother ?
but we had a deal .
there is no time to argue . the curse is almost upon us ,
and i must return to the fairies to make final preparations .
it is vital that you tell snow white what i just told you .
her child is our only hope .
she is the only one who can save us .
and my boy--
what will happen to him ?
all we can do is have faith that one day
the savior will restore all that we have lost .
shall we tell snow white ?
no .
get in the wardrobe , my boy .
geppetto , you can &apos;t .
things have changed . the savior needs her mother .
no , she needs someone to protect her ,
to make her believe in her destiny .
my boy--he can do that .
i don &apos;t understand , father . she said--
i don &apos;t care what she said .
all that matters is you are safe .
but you told me to be honest , father .
you told me not to lie .
sometimes ...
we have to lie to protect the people we love , eh ?
you must look out for the child in this new land .
you must protect her .
i don &apos;t want to go . i don &apos;t want to leave you .
pinocchio ,
you must remember what the blue fairy said .
in 28 years ,
you must make sure the savior believes .
promise me you &apos;ll do that .
that is the only way we &apos;ll--
we &apos;ll see each other again .
i promise .
good . here .
there will be many temptations in this new world , pinocchio ,
but as long as you remain brave , truthful , and unselfish ,
you will not fail .
here . get in . get in . get in .
you &apos;ll find me again .
and on that day , i will look at you with pride .
you will be a great man , my son .
what the hell is this ?
last i checked , it was a diner .
no more screwing around .
i am not a character in one of your books .
what the hell are we doing here ?
i think you know .
you &apos;ve been here before .
this is the diner you were brought to when you were found as a baby .
so you found an article about me . so what ?
i thought this trip was supposed to be about you .
it is .
this is my story ,
and it &apos;s your story .
and how is that ?
that 7 @-@ year @-@ old boy who found you ...
that was me .
you must look out for this child in this new land .
promise me you &apos;ll do that .
that is the only way we &apos;ll-- we &apos;ll see each other again .
i promise .
why are we in the woods ?
all the answers you &apos;ve been searching for
are right where i found you .
see ? you &apos;re not that 7 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
i wasn &apos;t found in the woods .
i was found on the side of a highway .
why do you think that ?
because you read it in the newspaper ?
did it ever occur to you
that maybe that 7 @-@ year @-@ old boy lied about where he found you ?
no . but it occurs to me
that you &apos;ve been lying to me about everything ,
and i &apos;m done listening .
when i found you , you were wrapped in a blanket ,
and the name &quot; emma &quot; was embroidered along the bottom of it .
that wasn &apos;t in the article , was it ?
how would i know that unless i was there ?
okay .
let &apos;s say you were that kid .
why lie about where you found me ?
i lied to protect you .
from what ?
that .
a tree ?
you &apos;ve read henry &apos;s book , right ?
you know about the curse , don &apos;t you ?
your role in it ?
it &apos;s true , emma .
we both came into this world ...
through this tree .
you &apos;re asking me to believe
that you are a fairy tale character ?
pinocchio .
right . of course pinocchio .
explains all the lying .
you &apos;re the one who added the story to henry &apos;s book .
i needed you to know the truth .
the truth is you are out of your mind ,
and you &apos;re not even a very good liar .
why not write the end of that story ?
because this is the ending , and we &apos;re writing it right now .
and how does this story end ?
with you believing .
not gonna happen .
emma ? emma , wait .
what ... is wrong ... with your leg ?
i failed .
what are you talking about ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . you don &apos;t believe .
if you think that by making me feel sorry for you
that something &apos;s gonna change , you are wrong .
i am not screwing around here .
whatever you believe or don &apos;t , this is real , emma .
i am sick .
that &apos;s an understatement .
you ever been to phuket ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
amazing island .
full of pleasures . the perfect place to lose oneself .
that &apos;s where i was when you decided to stay in storybrooke .
how do you know when i decided to stay in storybrooke ?
because at 8 : 15 in the morning ,
i woke up with a shooting pain in my leg .
that &apos;s 8 : 15 at night in storybrooke .
sound familiar ?
that &apos;s when time there started to move forward again .
i was supposed to be there for you ,
and i wasn &apos;t .
because i was halfway around the world ,
i got a painful reminder of just how far i &apos;d strayed .
if that tree won &apos;t make you believe ,
maybe this will .
how does that prove anything ?
look .
august , i &apos;m looking .
you don &apos;t see it , do you ?
see what ?
your denial is more powerful than i thought .
it &apos;s preventing you from seeing the truth .
okay , one of us is losing it here , and it &apos;s not me .
you don &apos;t want to believe .
after everything you &apos;ve seen , why can &apos;t you just do it ?
why is it so important to you that i do ?
because i , the town-- everyone needs you .
i don &apos;t want them to need me .
well , that &apos;s too bad , because we all do .
you &apos;re saying that i am responsible for everyone &apos;s happiness ?
that is crap !
i didn &apos;t ask for that ! i don &apos;t want it !
right now .
a little while ago , you didn &apos;t want henry either ,
but then he came to you ,
and now you are fighting like hell for him .
for him ! because that is all i can handle right now .
and i &apos;m not even doing a good job at that !
now you &apos;re telling me i have to save everyone ?
that is beyond ridiculous . i don &apos;t want any of it .
well , that &apos;s too bad , emma ,
because that doesn &apos;t change the truth .
you are our only hope .
then you &apos;re all screwed .
don &apos;t cry , emma .
look at me . watch this .
there . that &apos;s better , right ?
do those tools belong to you ?
i was just trying to fix the crib .
i didn &apos;t want emma to fall out and get hurt .
don &apos;t ever touch anything in this house again .
nothing belongs to you .
yes , mr. raskind .
you okay ?
uh , can you keep a secret ?
where &apos;d you get that ?
i stole it from the sock drawer .
it &apos;s enough to buy us all bus tickets out of here .
you &apos;re leaving ? when ?
right now .
you wanna come ?
i told my father i &apos;d take care of emma .
can she come ? please ?
we can &apos;t take care of baby .
you want to stay here for the rest of your life ?
be my guest .
wait .
i &apos;m sorry , emma .
faster and faster .
come on . work . work . work . work . work .
you see ?
align the gear on the spindle ,
then press the spring .
who taught you that ?
my father .
he taught you well .
he must be very proud .
i don &apos;t know about that .
i don &apos;t think i became the man he wanted me to be .
well , have you tried to make it up to him ?
i made him a promise ...
a long time ago .
by the time i got around to making good on it ,
i think it was too late .
but you kept your promise .
you realized your mistake , and you tried to fix it .
that &apos;s important .
if i had a son , that would be enough for me .
you look like you might be shorthanded .
i get by .
how would you feel
about ...
taking on an assistant ?
i can &apos;t pay you .
that &apos;s okay .
i just feel like fixing things .
come in .
here , here .
code red . code red . henry ?
emma , what &apos;s wrong ?
i need to talk to you .
about operation cobra ?
no . about us . meet me downstairs .
if my mom sees me out here talking to you ,
she &apos;ll get really mad .
henry , i need to ask you something very important .
do you want to get away from regina ?
do you want to come and live with me ?
more than anything .
okay . then buckle up . you ready ?
okay . why ? where we going ?
we &apos;re leaving storybrooke .
