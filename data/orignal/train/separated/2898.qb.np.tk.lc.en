betrothed couple .
hey !
hi !
pheebs ?
skull ?
yeah , it &apos;s my mom &apos;s .
oh , my god !
no , no , no . it &apos;s not my mom .
it belonged to my mom .
she used to put it out every christmas ...
... to remind us that even though it &apos;s christmas , people still die .
and you can put candy in it .
hey .
hey .
licorice ?
sure .
i get ben for the holidays this year .
that &apos;s great !
are you gonna dress up as santa ?
nope .
i mean , i know susan does every year ...
... but i want to take this year to teach him about hanukkah .
and maybe i could teach ben ...
... about the christmas skull and how people die .
you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe .
hey .
did you know he was in there ?
no .
how long have we been home ?
about half an hour .
lovely .
the one with the holiday armadillo
you know what i was thinking ? when we get married , are you gonna ...
... change your last name to &quot; bing &quot; ?
no .
why not ?
&quot; bing &quot; is weird .
yeah , i know what you mean . gellar !
oh , hey , you guys .
guess what . my landlord just called . my apartment &apos;s gonna be ready soon .
so i guess i &apos;ll be moving out .
phoebe , i &apos;m gonna miss you .
yes , you will be very sad .
i gotta go tell rachel the good news .
you guys are gonna live together again ?
yeah , why not ?
she &apos;s just having so much fun with joey ...
... i just assumed she &apos;d still be living with him .
why do you think she &apos;s having so much fun living with joey ?
no reason , except she ...
... told me .
really ? she said she didn &apos;t want to live with me ?
no . no , she didn &apos;t say that .
i think you should talk to monica now .
phoebe , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure she wants to live with you .
you &apos;re sure ? you &apos;re absolutely sure ?
no , but i &apos;ll bet she probably does .
oh , probably ?
i don &apos;t like that word .
i know what &quot; probably &quot; really means . yeah , yeah .
&quot; oh , your mom probably won &apos;t kill herself . &quot;
you know , &quot; no , the funeral director probably won &apos;t hit on you . &quot;
&quot; yeah , that nice couple probably will adopt you . &quot; okay , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not hanging all my hopes ...
... of rachel and i living together on &quot; probably . &quot;
you gotta take care of yourself in this world .
history teaches us nothing .
&quot; bing &quot; doesn &apos;t seem so weird now , does it ?
great , you &apos;re home .
guess what phoebe got me for christmas .
drums ?
no , drums !
hi , could we get two burritos to go , please ?
i &apos;m sorry . but not that sorry , because you don &apos;t have to live with it .
we have a reservation under the name chandler bing .
okay , we &apos;ll have a table for you in about 45 minutes .
forty @-@ five minutes ? we have tickets to the music man at 8 .
i &apos;m sorry . christmas is a very busy time , sir .
is this because of the burrito thing ?
you need to give him money .
give him money ? it was a joke !
no . to get a table . places like this are always shaking you down .
everybody wants a payoff .
all right , calm down , o &apos;malley .
i &apos;ll slip him some money .
but you &apos;ve got to be smooth about it .
hey , i can be smooth .
we &apos;re in a bit of a hurry , so if you could get us a table ...
... a little quicker , i &apos;d appreciate it .
of course , sir .
okay .
how &apos;d it go ?
had the money in the wrong hand .
hey . you don &apos;t feel ...
... like you &apos;re gonna throw up , do you ?
no .
well , i do . so let &apos;s ...
so , ben , you ...
you know what holiday is coming up , don &apos;t you ?
christmas .
yeah , and you know what other holiday is coming up ?
christmas eve .
yes , but also ...
hanukkah !
see , you &apos;re part jewish , and hanukkah is a jewish holiday .
santa has reindeers that can fly .
right , but on hanukkah ...
hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle .
see , years and years ago , there were these people called the maccabees .
okay , that &apos;s right . yes ...
... but on hanukkah , we sing :
okay , it &apos;s not a contest .
when is santa coming ?
how about this year , instead of santa ...
... we have fun celebrating hanukkah ?
no santa ?
was i bad ?
no . oh , no , no . hey , you weren &apos;t bad . you &apos;ve been very good , ben .
santa &apos;s mad at me .
no , hey , hey , come on .
ben , santa is not mad at you , okay ?
you &apos;re his favorite little guy .
so santa &apos;s coming ?
yes !
santa &apos;s coming .
will he bring me an ant farm ?
will you keep it at mommy &apos;s ?
okay .
then sure !
maybe this slipping @-@ him @-@ money thing is not gonna work .
maybe we should just wait .
you &apos;re the one who said you would die if you didn &apos;t see music man .
i didn &apos;t say &quot; die . &quot;
i said &quot; cry . &quot;
it &apos;s easy . just keep it casual .
give him a kind word , shake his hand and give him the money .
how do you know so much about this ?
i don &apos;t know .
richard used to do it , didn &apos;t he ?
we &apos;d be eating our soup right now .
mustached bastard .
okay , those people just left . come on . quick , give him the money .
excuse me .
we &apos;re in a bit of a hurry . can we ... ?
so you like the drums .
that &apos;s great .
you know , i was worried that they would create maybe ...
... an unbearable living situation .
but , okay , well , apparently not . so , yay !
hey , pheebs , we already learned a song .
ready ? one , two , three , four .
tequila !
that &apos;s fun .
here you go .
thank you , gunther . put her there .
definitely not easier with coins .
thank you .
thank you .
hey , pheebs .
hey .
here . now i only owe you 49.50 .
hey , pheebs ...
... if you want to get joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building ...
... why not get him something more subtle ...
... like a wrecking ball ...
... or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway ?
it &apos;s not just the drum noise . every five minutes ...
... joey throws his sticks in the air ...
... and i have to hear : &quot; oh , my eye ! oh , god , my eye ! &quot;
i mean , it is so annoying .
yes , thank you .
you see , this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .
phoebe , you got joey drums to annoy rachel ...
... so she wouldn &apos;t want to live there anymore ?
maybe on some level .
joey , you know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air .
what is rock &apos; r roll about that ?
hey , joey , i got you another present .
hold it ! before you tell me what it is ...
okay , what is it ?
it &apos;s a ...
... tarantula !
god , rachel , i &apos;m sorry . what was i thinking ...
... giving joey this big , gross , scary spider ...
... in such a poorly constructed cage ?
what are you talking about ? i love them .
i had a tarantula when i was a kid . but it died because my cat ate it .
and then my cat died .
but , joey , isn &apos;t this cool ?
is it on me ? i feel like it &apos;s on me . i got ...
oh , isn &apos;t that adorable ?
joey is afraid of the tarantula .
he &apos;s so adorable .
god , he &apos;s just so much fun .
joey &apos;s the best . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having so much fun here .
wait a minute .
what &apos;s the matter ?
our apartment is ready .
and that makes you angry because ... ?
because you &apos;d rather live here with joey .
where did you get that ?
monica and chandler ...
... said that you were having so much fun here ...
... and apparently no amount of drums or tarantula is gonna change that .
phoebe , did you get all this stuff for joey ...
... to try and drive me out of the apartment ?
you might as well have just gotten him a fish .
you know how fish freak me out .
fish .
but it wouldn &apos;t have mattered . you and i are gonna live together .
we &apos;re roommates . that &apos;s the deal .
yes , but i wanted you to want to live with me .
but , okay , if you &apos;re having so much fun over here ...
it &apos;s so much more fun with you .
we did have fun , didn &apos;t we ?
we had so much fun .
remember the time we were playing with the superball ...
... and we accidentally threw it through the window and it broke ?
i remember paying for the window , but i don &apos;t remember how it broke .
yeah , stuff like that .
well , anyway , they say , if we want , we could see it tonight .
i would love to .
yay , okay !
good , good , good .
great . all right . good .
and monica asked me to make the drumming stop .
done .
hello , sir . you here to return those pants ?
no , these are my pants .
okay .
how can i help you ?
do you have a santa outfit left ?
two days before christmas ? sorry , man .
did you try costume city ?
yeah , i &apos;ve tried everywhere .
please , please . i mean , i &apos;ll pay extra .
sorry . but ...
... i do have 74 of them coming back on the 26th .
okay , look . do you have anything christmas @-@ y ?
i promised my son , and i really don &apos;t want to disappoint him .
come on , you gotta have something .
i &apos;m the holiday armadillo !
i &apos;m a friend of santa &apos;s ...
... and he sent me here to wish you ...
... a merry christmas !
what happened to santa , holiday armadillo ?
santa was unavailable ...
... so close to christmas .
come in , have a seat .
you must be exhausted , coming all the way from texas .
texas ?
that &apos;s right , ben .
i &apos;m santa &apos;s representative ...
... for all the southern states .
and mexico !
but santa sent me here ...
... to give you these presents , ben .
maybe the lady will help me with these presents .
wow , thanks !
you &apos;re welcome , ben .
merry christmas .
and happy hanukkah !
are you for hanukkah too ? because i &apos;m part jewish .
you are ? me too .
because armadillos also wandered in the desert ?
you want to wander in the hall ?
hey , ben !
what if the holiday armadillo ...
... told you all about the festival of lights ?
cool !
come on , ben .
years and years ago ...
... there were these people called ...
... the maccabees !
ho , ho , ho !
merry christmas !
santa !
hey !
what are you doing here , santa ?
well , i &apos;m here to see my old buddy ben .
what are you doing here ...
... weird turtle man ?
i &apos;m the holiday armadillo ...
... your part @-@ jewish friend .
you sent me here to give ben some presents .
remember ?
what ?
did you bring me any presents , santa ?
you bet i did , ben .
put her there .
well , it would have worked this time if his hands weren &apos;t so damn small .
ho , ho , ho !
ben , why don &apos;t you come open more presents .
santa , the armadillo and i will have a talk in the kitchen .
there &apos;s a sentence i never thought i &apos;d say .
what are you doing ?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume ...
... so i borrowed one from a guy at work .
thank you , but you gotta leave .
why ?
because ...
... l &apos;m finally getting him excited about hanukkah ...
... and you &apos;re wrecking it .
but i didn &apos;t get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly .
i &apos;m sorry , chandler , but this is really important to me .
fine , i &apos;ll give the suit back .
hey , you think you can keep it another night ?
santa ? really ?
yeah , is that okay ?
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?
no .
then it &apos;s okay !
okay , ben . santa has to go .
say goodbye .
no , why does he have to go ?
because if santa and the holiday ...
... armadillo ...
... are ever in the same room for too long ...
... the universe will implode !
merry christmas !
no , why can &apos;t the armadillo leave ? i want santa .
fine , i give up . santa ...
santa can stay !
well , i &apos;ll stay ...
... but only because i want to hear about hanukkah .
ben , will you sit here with santa ...
... and learn about hanukkah ?
okay , santa .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
all right , it &apos;s time ...
... for the story of hanukkah .
years and years ago ...
... there were these people called the maccabees !
merry christmas !
oh , wow , look at this place !
oh , this is terrible .
they &apos;ve made so many changes ...
... i can &apos;t even feel my grandmother &apos;s presence anymore .
oh , new sconces !
oh , my god !
what ?
okay , remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall ...
... to make that into two bedrooms ?
yeah .
and that the landlord might find out ...
... and then tear it down ?
yeah ?
do you really not know where i &apos;m going with this ?
no , of course i do . what ?
it left . it &apos;s one huge room .
oh , no !
wow !
see ?
i guess we &apos;ll just have to put the wall back up .
you can &apos;t , because of the new skylight .
there &apos;s a skylight ?
wow !
so , what should we do ? should we start looking for a new place ?
you know , i &apos;m sensing ...
... that my grandmother would not be comfortable with that .
oh , yeah ?
starting to feel her again there , are we ?
a little bit . yeah .
yeah .
pheebs , is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone ?
you heard it too ? you have the gift .
phoebe , it &apos;s okay .
i like living with joey .
are you sure ?
please . i hate packing ...
... it &apos;s closer to work .
and we do have fun .
although , i &apos;m really gonna miss living with you .
oh , me too .
i know .
oh , wait . did you hear that ?
listen . i &apos;m getting something from your grandmother .
she said that since you get to keep the one @-@ bedroom apartment ...
... you should give rachel the purple chair .
no , i do not hear that .
oh , no , wait a minute . oh , okay .
she didn &apos;t say &quot; chair , &quot; she said &quot; share . &quot; you should share the one @-@ bedroom apartment .
oh , the purple chair . no , yeah , i heard that .
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil ...
... that should have lasted just one day , burned for ...
eight whole days .
that &apos;s right .
and that &apos;s why we celebrate hanukkah today . the end .
awesome .
yeah .
my favorite part ...
... was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt .
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part .
why is santa kissing aunt monica ?
because aunt monica was very , very good this year .
okay , ben , it &apos;s time to light ...
... the hanukkah candles !
hey .
wow ! looks like the easter bunny &apos;s funeral in here .
come on , come on . we &apos;re lighting the candles .
i understand why superman is here ...
... but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunny &apos;s funeral ?
did you get it ?
i got it .
is it back in the cage ?
it &apos;s back in the cage .
is the cage closed ?
