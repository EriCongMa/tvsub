it means a lot to her to feel included .
sometimes dark clouds have silver linings .
he sort of asked me out .
it &apos;s ok with you if i go out with him ?
sometimes they don &apos;t .
once that baby comes ,
i &apos;m gonna be stuck raising a child alone .
when it comes to life on wisteria lane ...
will you marry me ?
things that seem too good to be true ...
did she know you killed your wife ?
usually turn out ...
get away from him now while you can .
to be deadly .
brides are sensitive creatures ,
and no one knows this better
than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them .
well , i think a 10 @-@ foot train is great ,
but a shorter one would be just as nice ,
and you wouldn &apos;t have to worry about people tripping on it .
personally , i love smoked rabbit ,
but for a sure crowd @-@ pleaser ,
you can &apos;t beat chicken .
uh , sure . who doesn &apos;t love a string quartet ?
but if you got a band ,
maybe people could dance ,
as opposed to sway .
but one area where a bridesmaid &apos;s tact
is most required involves the dress ...
so what do you think ?
she &apos;s required to wear .
i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;ve ever seen this shade of green before .
yeah . don &apos;t you think it &apos;ll be gorgeous with my coloring ?
yes , it would look perfect .
for someone with your coloring .
i mean i was lucky to find these ,
it &apos;s not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks .
then why the rush ?
yeah , bree , i &apos;d have thought of you
as a person who wants time to plan .
well , orson and i talked about it ,
and we just feel at our age
it &apos;s silly to wait .
with your help , we can get it all done .
well , we are happy to pitch in .
oh , uh , that reminds me .
i have to get a copy of the seating chart for you , gabby .
you are in charge of the centerpieces .
and don &apos;t worry , susan . i will think of a job for you .
here &apos;s a job .
how about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist .
susan , we don &apos;t know that !
all we have is some crazy woman &apos;s accusation .
his wife vanished and he didn &apos;t even tell bree .
how much proof do you need ?
he says he &apos;s innocent .
she believes him .
if we say we don &apos;t , she &apos;ll just end up hating us .
well , i &apos;m sorry . i can not sit here on my key lime ass
and watch bree make the worst mistake of her life .
and what mistake would that be ?
honestly ...
yes , a bridesmaid can question
many of the bride &apos;s choices ...
these dresses are hideous .
but the groom isn &apos;t one of them .
the perfect couple ,
we &apos;ve all met them , haven &apos;t we ?
that man and woman so clearly made for each other ,
we feel certain they &apos;re on the road to happiness .
but that road has many detours .
and even perfect couples can find themselves ...
at a dead end .
you want what ?
you heard me .
and i want the bedroom stereo ,
i want the marble console ,
and that painting of st. augustine .
you don &apos;t even know who he is .
i know he matches the drapes .
people , can we focus here ?
and i want my pearl necklace back .
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t notice that you swiped it .
that was my mama &apos;s and hers before her .
i think it belongs in my family .
there was a time that you thought i belonged in your family ,
and you got over that .
stop eating my fries .
i &apos;m hungry .
you know what the doctor said .
you should see his cholesterol .
this man bleeds baking grease .
enough .
you two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other .
because you are about to bring a child into this world ,
and divorced or not , once that child arrives ,
you will be bound together for as long as you live .
well , in that case , have some more fries .
i &apos;ll pick kayla up on sunday .
whenever . just go .
you and turk have a great time .
oh , trust me , we will .
the man is a jackhammer .
bye , tom . see ya sunday .
bye .
where is she going ?
she and turk are going down to the river for the weekend .
that &apos;s turk ? that &apos;s the new boyfriend ? uh @-@ uh , no .
hey , hey , hey , tom , please .
i don &apos;t want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that .
you haven &apos;t even met him .
he could be the sweetest man in the world .
more importantly , ever since he entered the picture ,
squeaky fromme is never around .
it has been bliss .
i haven &apos;t made this face in a week .
if you ruin this , so help me , i will hurt you .
just look at him . look at him , please .
i swear ,
that is a child &apos;s skull hanging from his rearview mirror .
doesn &apos;t that concern you ?
no , i &apos;m good .
could be a monkey .
uh , i think i will have the ... mesclun salad .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s all you &apos;re having ?
well , all the food is very expensive .
you don &apos;t need to whisper .
the waiter knows they &apos;re robbing us blind .
you can have whatever you want .
in that case , i &apos;ll have the lobster bisque
and the veal with the black truffles .
is that okay ?
yeah , that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll just have jane moved to the va hospital .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m kidding . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll have what she &apos;s having .
of course . thank you .
god , i love seeing you laugh .
it &apos;s been a long time since i &apos;ve been in the mood to . thank you .
oh , dear god .
did i squeeze too hard ?
no . it &apos;s my wife &apos;s parents .
oh , is this gonna be awkward ?
no , no , no , not unless , of course , they see us .
ian ?
awkward .
jeff . renee . what a delightful surprise .
it &apos;s so good to see you , dear .
hello . i &apos;m renee ,
and this is my husband , jeff .
susan mayer .
doctor . dr. susan mayer .
she &apos;s new to jane &apos;s neurology team .
i just assumed you worked in ian &apos;s publishing house .
well , yes , how nice that would have been , huh ?
but no , no . i &apos;m a ... a brain specialist .
well , dr. mayer , maybe i can ask you ,
our daughter &apos;s most recent eeg showed brain spikes ,
but it didn &apos;t change the score on her glasgow scale .
why is that ?
what an excellent question .
and this is the , uh ... spinal cord .
and it , of course , attaches to the brain .
you don &apos;t have to dumb it down for us , doctor .
we &apos;ve been dealing with jane &apos;s condition for years .
oh . good .
well , then , let &apos;s get technical .
let &apos;s give dr. mayer the night off .
she was in surgery for ten hours today ,
performing a craniotomy .
that &apos;s exactly the procedure jane had . how &apos;d it go ?
uh , well , it just ...
i hear my phone vibrating .
hello . dr. mayer .
yeah , what ? you say that his brain shut off ?
oh , well , i &apos;ll be right there . um , stat .
i &apos;m sorry . duty calls .
orson , i moved the furniture back .
good lord , bree . not again .
don &apos;t you want our first dance to be perfect ?
there &apos;ll be 200 people staring at us .
you know , bree , since that incident at our engagement party ,
there &apos;s been a lot of dark talk about me .
i don &apos;t pay attention to gossip .
i &apos;m just saying i would understand
if you &apos;d a second thoughts about marrying a man
who &apos;s under a cloud .
no one who knows you
could seriously believe you could hurt a woman .
strangers may talk , but i know the truth .
really ?
men have lied to me before .
believe me , it &apos;ll never happen again .
so you trust me completely ?
clearly i do .
the body &apos;s unusually well @-@ preserved
because it was buried in clay .
do we have a cause of death ?
blunt force trauma to the head .
pull all the missing persons reports .
cross @-@ check against her height , age , and weight .
i &apos;m running a dna panel ,
since we won &apos;t be able to use her dental records .
why not ?
whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth .
nora . what are you doing back ? are you ok ?
shut the door .
ok .
i don &apos;t want kayla to find me like this .
what &apos;s wrong ?
turk and i had a fight .
what ? no . no , no , no .
what happened ?
what happened is , turk is an ass .
on the way to the river , we stopped off at this bar .
then we were playing pool
and i got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses .
who cares , right ? i mean , who cares ?
it &apos;s a bar , and we all do it , right ?
right .
so , he tells me to watch my mouth ,
and i &apos;m like , whoa ,
get a load of mr. two strikes trying to tell me
how to act in public .
and then he called me a whore . we &apos;re done .
ok , whoa , whoa . take a deep breath .
you don &apos;t break up with a guy
because in a weak moment he calls you a whore .
and then on the way out ,
he threatened to hit me .
ok , but he didn &apos;t , and until he ...
oh , jeez , lynette . whose side are you on ?
i &apos;m on the side of love .
you guys seem like such a perfect couple .
i know .
i just ...
you don &apos;t wanna throw that all away
&apos;cause of a little fight with no hitting .
no . it &apos;s over .
i just got off the phone with turk &apos;s parole officer
i was like &quot; guess who ain &apos;t in nevada no more ? &quot;
click .
i think i &apos;m gonna have to stay here tonight .
freeze !
austin ?
hey , aunt edie .
anyway , mom just got back from her cruise to jamaica
with new boobs and a 24 @-@ year @-@ old cabin boy .
needless to say , me and mr. can i get you some more hot towels ?
we didn &apos;t exactly hit it off .
after i broke his nose ,
i figured it was time to visit my favorite aunt .
your mom always did have lousy taste in men .
so , i figured i &apos;d crash here for the night ,
then hitch down to mexico , hang out , party .
yeah . i &apos;m thinking , like , no way in hell .
stay here with me
until things blow over with your mom , ok ?
cool . thanks .
wait . you &apos;re 18 , right ?
well , that &apos;s what my id says .
yeah , mine too .
you are supposed to be on bed rest .
i &apos;m bored .
well , why do you try putting on a pair of pants .
that should kill a couple of hours .
hey , babe .
hey , what is she doing out of bed ?
that can &apos;t be good for her .
or the stairs .
what do you want ?
the mediator was right .
a month from now ,
we &apos;re not just gonna be carlos and gabby ,
we &apos;re gonna be mom and dad .
and i don &apos;t wanna be at war with the mother of my child .
so , here .
your mama &apos;s pearls .
carlos .
thank you .
and ?
and what ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to make some reciprocal gesture ?
fine . you can come to bree &apos;s wedding reception ,
as my guest .
thanks . where is it ?
here .
here ? you &apos;re throwing the reception ?
it &apos;s our wedding present to bree .
i give you a priceless family heirloom ,
and in return you invite me to a party at my house
that i &apos;m paying for ?
well , what kind of gesture did you have in mind ?
the things i &apos;ll do for jewelry .
susan , i am so sorry .
dr. mayer ?
panic . pure panic .
here . these are for ruining our first date .
not in front of mike .
look , mike , ian brought you flowers .
i &apos;ll just go put them in some water .
look , i was just trying to protect jane &apos;s parents .
oh , please ...
they haven &apos;t accepted the fact that
jane isn &apos;t going to wake up .
if they knew we were on a date ,
that i was trying to move on ,
well , it would devastate them .
a lovely excuse , but it isn &apos;t the whole story .
excuse me ?
a part of you feels like you &apos;re cheating on her .
no .
well , perhaps a small part , but that doesn &apos;t mean ...
it &apos;s all right , &apos; cause i feel guilty , too .
that &apos;s why we should just stop this right now
because it &apos;s all way too complicated .
i think we &apos;d both be happier
if we just went back to being friends .
well , i don &apos;t think i can do that .
the truth is , i haven &apos;t thought of you
as just a friend for some time now .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t have let myself feel that way ,
but i have .
and i can &apos;t go back . i &apos;m sorry .
well , if we can &apos;t be friends ...
... then i guess we &apos;ll be nothing .
hey , leave that alone .
sorry . i was just ...
... turning it down .
you &apos;re not a music fan ?
sure .
it &apos;s just , got anything where a pimp isn &apos;t beating his ho ?
i &apos;m austin , edie britt &apos;s nephew .
i &apos;m julie . susan mayer &apos;s daughter .
anyway , i was trying to do my homework , so ...
on a saturday ?
well , make sure and take regular breaks
and stop for a sensible dinner .
just keep it down .
you had it really loud .
that &apos;s how i like it .
how do you like it ?
you know what ? you &apos;re not that hot .
hey , what you doing ?
i &apos;m working on the seating chart for bree &apos;s wedding .
nora ? who invited her ?
i did .
we need to find her another boyfriend .
weddings are crawling with single men .
you &apos;re not seating her next to my friends ?
sacrifices must be made , tom .
not jerry rawlings .
if she gets her psycho hooks into jerry rawlings ,
he will never speak to me again .
there are other urologists in the world .
go back to that other guy .
the one with the cold hands ?
it &apos;s once a year . suck it up .
get a grip , lynette .
get a grip ? i am hanging on for dear life here .
you are the one that brought this
little problem into our family ,
and the only thing i should be hearing from you is ,
&quot; how can i help ? &quot;
i am also putting steve hanson at her table ,
so you might wanna start shopping around for a new golf buddy .
get a grip .
hi . my name &apos;s susan mayer .
your neighbor told me i could find you here .
yeah ?
well , i was at my friend bree &apos;s engagement party ,
you know , when you came in and
you did that whole &quot; orson killed his wife &quot; thing .
i was just wondering if you could elaborate .
he killed her .
what else do you need to know ?
well , what makes you so sure ?
do you have any proof ?
look , i can &apos;t talk now .
i get off at six .
my friend is marrying that man in two hours . please .
ok , i need ten dollars in unrolled pennies ,
and i need to see you count it
because last time you stiffed me .
after alma disappeared ,
the police came and searched the house .
the police ? what did they find ?
nothing .
and that &apos;s bad why ?
don &apos;t you get it ?
when the police showed up ,
orson had scrubbed every inch clean with bleach .
no fingerprints ,
no skin cells , no dna .
it was like alma had never existed .
who cleans a house like that
unless he has something to hide ?
when i left the bank ,
i called the detective that worked the case .
he said that the only reason orson was never charged
was because they never found a body .
so he was an actual suspect ?
he was the only suspect .
oh my god ! what are we gonna do ?
well , you know what we have to do .
that was close .
the florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet ,
but not to worry ,
crisis averted .
bree , we have to talk .
ah , reverend . any word from the bridal party ?
still in the bride &apos;s room . you know women .
they &apos;re probably fussing about mascara and blush .
he did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid .
i said it was a theory .
alma disappeared under suspicious circumstances .
i don &apos;t have time . i &apos;m getting married .
this is your day . you can push the ceremony back an hour .
now , get that detective on the phone .
talk things out with orson .
i can &apos;t talk to orson . it &apos;s bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding .
you know what &apos;s really bad luck ?
marrying a wife @-@ killer .
if the three of you don &apos;t drop this right now ,
i will never forgive you .
bree , we are just doing this because we love you .
but if you can honestly tell us
that you don &apos;t have the slightest doubt ...
none whatsoever .
dearly beloved , we are gathered together in the sight of god
to join this man and woman in holy ...
excuse me . could you give us just a second ?
is something wrong ?
i just need a moment .
before we do this , there &apos;s something i need to ask you .
what ?
did you kill your wife ?
susan talked to that carolyn woman .
why didn &apos;t you tell me the police searched your house ?
because it &apos;s embarrassing .
and they didn &apos;t find anything .
is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly ?
when i &apos;m upset , i clean .
for god &apos;s sake , bree ,
i swear to you , i did not kill my wife .
ok .
proceed .
dearly beloved ,
we are gathered here together in the sight of god
to join this man and woman in holy matrimony ,
which is an honorable estate ...
hey . look at you , miss popular .
so , are you having a good time over there ?
as if . and i don &apos;t know what idiot stuck me at that table ,
but every guy over there is just a boring stiff .
all of them ? what about jerry ? jerry &apos;s fun .
you mean mr. fatty hair plugs ?
yeah , he &apos;s a blast .
how about steve ?
you know what , i hear his family has money .
well , then maybe they could all chip in
and buy him some deodorant .
i &apos;m through with those losers .
i &apos;m gonna stay right here with you .
are you gonna eat that ?
hey , look at you .
god , i hate wearing a tux .
on my way in ,
bree &apos;s aunt fern asked me to park the car .
she &apos;s got glaucoma .
to her , you &apos;re nothing but a hispanic blur .
let me fix your tie .
hey , you &apos;re wearing mama &apos;s pearls .
yeah .
hey , julie . have you met my nephew austin ?
yeah , we &apos;ve met . i just didn &apos;t recognize him with his shirt on .
she couldn &apos;t take her eyes off my abs .
i felt violated .
hi , edie . nice party , huh ?
it was .
perfect .
it &apos;s nice to see you two getting along again .
we &apos;ve sort of turned a corner .
really ? you &apos;re gonna be getting back together ?
god , no .
maybe .
wow , is that shrimp ?
what would make you think
i &apos;d even consider taking you back ?
you invited me to be your date .
guest , carlos . i said guest .
come on . you &apos;ve been flirting with me since i came in .
&quot; baby , let me fix your tie . &quot;
you sure are sending some mixed signals .
you want a clear signal ? how &apos;s this ?
ian .
susan .
what are you doing here ?
my cousin is dr. hodge &apos;s dental hygienist .
her husband couldn &apos;t join her ,
since he &apos;d come down with impetigo .
she called me ,
knowing how much i love a good garter toss ...
ian ...
yes , i &apos;m such a terrible liar .
i mean , impetigo . where did that come from ?
so , what are you really doing here ?
look , i can &apos;t stop thinking about us ,
about how great we could be together .
i think you &apos;re making a mistake .
ian ...
susan , please don &apos;t go . can &apos;t we at least talk about this ?
i can &apos;t , &apos; cause i have bridesmaid stuff .
hi there . i just wanted to say you &apos;re doing a great job ... tad .
that &apos;s such a masculine name .
my boyfriend seems to like it .
ok , here &apos;s the drill .
my ex is here , i wanna piss him off ,
so act like you &apos;re hot for me .
there &apos;s a hundred @-@ buck tip in it .
right . so , should i cup your boob ?
no , i &apos;ll drive .
tequila . straight .
hey , are there any decent single women at this wedding ?
not that i &apos;ve seen .
damn it , not a one .
hey , carlos . you should come over to our table .
that &apos;s where all the hotties are .
hey , everyone . i &apos;d say it is time that we get
bree and orson up here
for their first dance as a married couple .
ladies and gentlemen , i give you mr. and mrs. orson hodge .
orson , you look so serious .
i &apos;m trying to remember my steps .
you &apos;re upset , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re still thinking about what i said at the church .
which part , darling ?
the &quot; i do &quot; part or the &quot; did you kill your wife ? &quot; part ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i had to ask .
that &apos;s my point . you had to ask .
you are gonna rot in hell for this .
hey , i just brought two lost souls together .
ok , how about this ? he cheated on my friend .
he deserves every bit of crazy
she &apos;s gonna rain down on him .
hell , rot , you .
what are they doing ?
rounding second and heading for third .
carlos .
hey , gabby . look , i made a new friend .
yes , i &apos;ve been watching you make your new friend ,
and it &apos;s disgusting .
do you mind ? we &apos;re trying to dance .
who the hell are you , anyway ?
and why the hell are you at this wedding ?
this is not gonna end well .
they &apos;re just two random people who met at a wedding .
they can &apos;t pin it on me .
it was her .
lynette scavo , i wanna talk to you .
i &apos;ll see you at home .
what &apos;re you thinking ? i didn &apos;t invite you here
to embarrass me in front of my friends .
you just wanted me to watch
while you suck the zits off some teenage waiter .
that &apos;s it . i take my invitation back .
you are no longer welcome in my house .
fine . i &apos;ll go .
just give me back the pearls .
no !
gabby .
carlos , no .
they were mama &apos;s .
no !
now look what you &apos;ve done .
mrs. solis .
no , carlos .
give me that .
give me those .
pardon me , excuse me .
get away . those are mine .
the hell they are .
mrs. solis .
not now , xiao mei .
mrs. solis !
for god &apos;s sakes , what ?
i think maybe it &apos;s time .
and i wish you both a lifetime of happiness .
that was beautiful , aunt fern . thank you .
hey , they mopped up all the amniotic fluid ,
so we should feel safe to start the conga line .
actually , i &apos;d like to say a few words .
bree , orson ,
your love is an inspiration to us all .
that &apos;s very sweet . how do you know him ?
i thought he was on your side .
this is a second wedding for both of you ,
and i think you &apos;re jolly brave .
so often people find excuses not to fall in love again .
they &apos;re afraid .
but it &apos;s rare to find somebody that you connect with ,
so when you do , you have to follow your heart .
bree , orson , i salute you .
let &apos;s get the music cranking , and ...
actually , tom , could you just hang on a second ?
i also would like to say a few words .
to bree and orson .
yes , what could be better than a second love ?
and this time , you enter into it a little older , a little wiser .
but also , and this is key , with a bit of caution .
because while love can be spontaneous and wonderful ,
it can also be selfish ,
and sometimes the best thing you can do
is just to walk away .
uh ... not you two .
i mean , you two crazy kids are great .
congrats .
well , then , let &apos;s ...
hang on . i &apos;d like to respond to that toast .
bree , orson ,
sometimes walking away can seem the best choice ,
it &apos;s certainly the safest , but
what do you do when you find someone who makes you
feel joy when you thought you never would again ?
do you just let them go ?
no .
no , i can &apos;t do that .
you wanna ... ?
no .
i &apos;m good .
all right , then , let &apos;s dance .
well , i thought you might need a change of clothes .
yeah , you &apos;re still mad at me , huh ?
what were you thinking ?
setting carlos up with that skank .
i am sorry . i was desperate .
i had a little too much to drink .
and you are divorcing carlos .
no , lynette , carlos will never be fair game .
you know the rules .
you &apos;re right . you are right . you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
what ?
i &apos;m so unhappy .
ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives ,
i can &apos;t even work up a smile .
and the more she pushes , the more i resent tom .
tom , for something he did 12 years ago .
and i &apos;m afraid if i can &apos;t fix this
that the anger &apos;s just gonna fester , until ...
lynette , listen to me .
you and tom will survive this .
no , seriously , gabby .
i am so tired of pretending to smile .
you and tom will survive this .
yeah ? how can you be so sure ?
because some marriages were built to last .
and some aren &apos;t .
trust me , i know the difference .
i &apos;m looking for bree van de kamp .
could you excuse me for just a minute ?
orson , congratulations .
excuse me . are you mrs. van de kamp ?
it &apos;s hodge now .
yes , i &apos;m terribly sorry to barge in like this ,
but we need your husband to come down to the morgue .
we may have found his wife &apos;s body .
push , xiao mei , push .
ok , ok . deep breaths now .
we &apos;re getting close .
it &apos;s time . i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
honey , i &apos;m gonna cry .
carlos , i am so sorry about the ...
me too , me too .
i was way out of line .
i forgive you .
it &apos;s worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this .
ok , i can see the head now .
get the camera . get the camera .
oh , my god .
man , i gotta get the color fixed on this thing .
how could this happen ?
what kind of half @-@ assed fertility clinic are you running ?
prior to implantation ,
your embryo was switched with another client &apos;s .
so if we got theirs and
they got ours , then it &apos;s possible ...
i &apos;m afraid your embryo didn &apos;t take .
again , on behalf of the clinic , i am so sorry .
it &apos;s rare , but things do happen .
excuse me .
you screw up our lives and the best you can do is ,
&quot; that &apos;s the way the cookie crumbles &quot; ?
why is this guy writing down everything i say ?
mr. darby , our attorney .
we thought it wise to have him present .
know what else would &apos;ve been wise ?
sticking the right baby in the right belly .
mrs. solis , please ...
that &apos;s not alma .
are you sure ?
absolutely . thank god .
carolyn . what is she doing here ?
you didn &apos;t honestly think
they &apos;d take your word for it , did you ?
it &apos;s not her .
well , that &apos;s it , then . sorry for wasting your time .
this means nothing .
i &apos;m telling you , that man is as guilty as sin .
we know what you think .
now , would you please leave us alone ?
he &apos;s a cold @-@ blooded killer .
he &apos;s kind and decent ,
and nothing you could say will make me doubt him again .

and forget this ever happened .

me , too .

now that there &apos;s no baby ,
it &apos;ll make the divorce a lot simpler .
yeah , that &apos;s something .
so ...
see you at the mediator &apos;s .
see you then .
have you met the perfect couple ?
the two soul mates whose love never dies ?
the two lovers whose relationship is never threatened ?
the husband and wife who trust each other completely ?
if you haven &apos;t met the perfect couple ,
let me introduce you .
they stand atop a layer of butter cream frosting .
the secret of their success ?
well , for starters ,
they don &apos;t have to look at each other .
