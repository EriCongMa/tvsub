there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse ...
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
i wish , i wish ,
but nothing changes .
i wish i was better at wishing !
alas ! will no one slay this fearsome dragon
and win my hand in marriage ?
i will slay the fearsome dragon , my lady ,
or die trying !
good @-@ bye , dear prince .
it was nice knowing you !
who dares disturb my sleep ?
uh , he went that way !
then i will go that way .
very good idea .
you go that way , and i &apos;ll ...
whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! careful . careful .
don &apos;t let those coins roll away .
no . they might ... disappear .
whoop . whoop . ha . look at that .
oh , a cricket ! i love crickets !
crickets are trouble noisy bugs .
but they get to do whatever they want--
hopping from place to place . they &apos;re free .
you &apos;re free .
to do what we want .
to be who you are .
and you are who you are .
well , maybe i want to be something else .
maybe i don &apos;t wanna steal .
maybe i want to be good .
all that from a cricket .
told ya . trouble .
&quot; good &quot; is another word for &quot; weak . &quot;
let us do the thinking for you .
that &apos;s what parents are for .
to help you .
you are who you are , and there &apos;s no changing it , jiminy .
right ?
right .
right .
problem solved .
you weren &apos;t always a cricket .
i wasn &apos;t al--
oh , right . because i &apos;m ...
because you think i &apos;m jiminy cricket .
why--why do you-- why do you think that , henry ?
it &apos;s just because of who you are .
and who am i ?
you &apos;re a conscience . you help people see right from wrong .
so all of the crickets in storybrooke--
they were once people , too ?
there aren &apos;t too many crickets here . listen .
maybe it isn &apos;t late enough .
there &apos;s never been crickets here .
you &apos;ve just never noticed .
so you think that &apos;s proof that there &apos;s a curse ?
yes , but i know it &apos;s not enough .
i &apos;m looking for more .
so , henry , look , i asked you this once before ,
and you said you &apos;d think about it .
why do you think it &apos;s so important that this is real ?
it ...
it just is .
all right , well ...
keep thinking about that answer , henry ,
&apos;cause i think there &apos;s something buried there .
a tie ?
you know you don &apos;t have to dress a woman
as a man to give her authority .
so you think you can get people to do what you want
in that red coat ?
i &apos;m getting you to do what i want right now .
well , at least wear the badge . go on . take it .
if you really want to be a part of this community ,
you have to make it official .
everyone step back , please .
is that a crater ?
no , there were tunnels , uh , old mines .
be careful . step back .
something collapsed .
sheriff , set up a police perimeter .
marco , why don &apos;t you help with the fire department ?
ms. swan , this is now official town business .
you &apos;re free to go .
well , actually , i work for the town now .
she &apos;s my new deputy .
they say the mayor &apos;s always last to know .
it &apos;s in my budget .
indeed .
deputy , why don &apos;t you make yourself useful
and help with crowd control ?
people of storybrooke , don &apos;t be alarmed .
we &apos;ve always known this area was honeycombed
with old mining tunnels , but fear not .
i &apos;m going to undertake a project to make this area safe ,
to rehabilitate it into city use .
we will bulldoze it , collapse it , pave it .
pave it ? what if there &apos;s something down there ?
henry , what are you doing here ?
what &apos;s down there ?
nothing . now step back .
in fact , everyone , please , please step back . thank you .
let &apos;s go , boys .
what was that ?
henry , enough .
listen , this is a safety issue . wait in the car .
deputy swan , sheriff , cordon off the area .
hey , archie . over here .
this requires all of operation cobra--both of you .
i didn &apos;t realize i was in operation cobra .
of course you are . you know everything .
we can &apos;t let her do this .
what if there &apos;s something down there ?
they &apos;re just some old tunnels .
that just happen to collapse right after you get here ?
you &apos;re changing things . you &apos;re weakening the curse .
that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
yes , it is . did you do anything different today ?
cause something made this happen .
henry , i told you to wait in the car .
deputy , do your job .
dr. hopper , a word , please .
okay , we &apos;re done with this .
uh , excuse me ?
my son . we need a new treatment plan .
everything i do he thinks is part of some horrible plot .
i can &apos;t cover up a safety hazard
without him thinking i &apos;m hiding something .
how am i hiding something terrible in an old mine ?
how is any of this logical to him ?
he &apos;s got an amazing imagination .
yes , that you let run rampant .
well , i think it would be wrong to rip away
the world he &apos;s constructed .
i &apos;d rather use it to try and get--
sometimes i think you &apos;ve forgotten .
you work for me .
you &apos;re an employee , and i can fire you .
this is my town .
you will lose your office , lose your house .
i can cut you down to size
until you &apos;re a tiny , shrunken little creature ,
and this will be the only roof over your damn head .
what would you have me do ?
you take that delusion out of my son &apos;s head ,
and you crush it .
come on , jiminy .
oh , i remember this place .
looks like it &apos;s been a good year .
yeah , you can tell by all the fat people .
maybe we can run the elf tonic scam here .
oh , can &apos;t we just-- can &apos;t we just do the show ?
ohh . we make enough on the ticket sales .
do we have to steal , too ?
we don &apos;t need to , but it &apos;s nice .
we steal from them , and they steal from someone else .
it &apos;s called an economy .
we &apos;re a vital part of it .
i want to change . i @-@ i want to quit .
oh , this again .
no , you can &apos;t leave now .
we &apos;re getting old .
it &apos;s my hip .
my liver .
i got lumps in strange places .
i &apos;ve got burning sensations .
you &apos;d better stay with us .
just until we die .
now be a good boy and set up .
puppets !
wow ! what a great job you have !
you don &apos;t like it ?
no . no , i don &apos;t .
same show , same fairs every year .
well , then why don &apos;t you do something else ?
it &apos;s just who i am .
well , did you just come out here to watch us set up ?
no . i came out here to listen to the crickets .
oh , crickets .
oh , i haven &apos;t listened to the crickets in a while .
hey , you &apos;d better get home , or you &apos;re gonna catch a cold .
so are you . here . have my umbrella .
i don &apos;t live far .
i can &apos;t wait to see the show !
hey , archie .
marco , what are you doing here ?
oh , lunch . i &apos;m sorry . i forgot .
i &apos;ve got another patient . another time ?
sure . of course .
hey . have a good session , henry .
hey .
are you recruiting geppetto for operation cobra ?
you think marco is geppetto ?
sure . he &apos;s jiminy cricket &apos;s best friend ,
and marco &apos;s yours .
henry . henry , look .
we--we really need to talk about this , okay ?
i know you &apos;re not convinced , but i know where i can get proof .
what is this ?
a flashlight and c @-@ candy bars ?
oh , wait . henry .
henry , you do not want to go down there .
emma &apos;s here and stuff &apos;s happening .
i have to look at it .
henry . henry , stop . stop .
there is no proof .
look , all of this , all of this is a delusion .
do you know what a delusion is ?
i @-@ i think so .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not real and--and not healthy ,
and--and i thought that you &apos;d outgrow this ,
but , henry , you know ...
now it &apos;s turned into a psychosis .
do you know what a psychosis is ?
that--that &apos;s when you can no longer tell what &apos;s real ,
and if that continues ,
then--then i have to lock you away .
henry , look , this has to stop for your own good .
you gotta wake up .
this nonsense must end .
i don &apos;t know . &quot; m &quot; ?
画出小人身体的一部分 直到小人被吊死 游戏结束
mm @-@ hmm .
two of &apos; em .
get it yet ?
yes , and i am completely mortified .
i almost hanged on my own name .
don &apos;t worry . i would never have let you hang .
i would have added toes , a hat , maybe a horse .
is this a game you played a lot , uh , before ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;ll come back .
they &apos;re sending you home in a week .
they have to think you &apos;re progressing , don &apos;t they ?
physically .
well , you &apos;re making new memories just fine .
maybe i &apos;ll like these better .
okay . play again ?
can i guess , too ?
mrs. nolan . i thought ...
oh , it &apos;s noon already . i didn &apos;t realize . i should go .
good day , ms. blanchard .
honey , i brought more pictures .
maybe they &apos;ll jog something .
it &apos;s our old dog , ajax .
remember ?
yeah . yeah , ajax .
oh , i am the worst person in the world .
really ? in the whole world ?
if kathryn was horrible , it &apos;d be easier ,
but she &apos;s so ... nice .
and what exactly would be easier ?
nothing .
nothing &apos;s a good idea . you &apos;re smart .
you know not to get involved with a married guy .
it &apos;s not worth the heartache . trust me .
i &apos;ll get it .
kid , what happened ? come on .
archie ? archie !
what did you do ?
you told me not to take the fantasy away .
you told me it would devastate him .
when a course of therapy stops working , you just adjust it .
it is her ? did she threaten you ?
what could be strong enough to drown out your own conscience ?
i do not need to defend my professional decisions to you , okay ?
hello , madam mayor . nice work .
are you with him ?
yes , i &apos;m with dr. hopper , and guess what ?
you left your fingerprints all over him when you tried--
not him . henry . is he with you ?
i dropped henry at your office an hour ago .
well , he &apos;s not here .
i don &apos;t know where he is .
i do .
thank you very much .
and the names ?
to whom did these treasures belong ?
go thread for your favor .
thank you . you can go .
but you want something else , don &apos;t you ?
something with ...
magic ?
every year , i &apos;m stuck in that damn wagon ...
and i @-@ i want to be free .
i want to-- i want to be someone else ,
but ... something keeps holding me back .
something or someone ?
it &apos;s my parents .
then i have exactly what you need .
this will set you free .
pour it . sprinkle it .
put it in their curds and whey .
anything will work .
ah ! but you have nothing more to give to me .
tell you what .
after the potion has ... done its work ...
leave them where they are ,
and i &apos;ll come collect them .
it &apos;ll be my fee .
what will become of them ?
worry you not .
they &apos;ll be in safe hands , and you &apos;ll be free .
henry !
henry !
henry !
henry ! what do you got there , pongo ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s here .
i think he is . candy bar . he had these with him .
henry !
archie !
henry , it &apos;s not safe !
henry !
henry !
archie !
archie ! henry !
henry ?
henry ?
archie ! you &apos;re here to help me .
no , henry , listen .
we gotta get out of here , okay ?
so you &apos;re still against me .
henry , there &apos;s no time for that .
come on , henry ! come on .
you don &apos;t believe me ? you &apos;ll see . you &apos;ll see .
henry !
henry . henry , come back !
henry !
look , can &apos;t we skip this tonight ?
i mean , we don &apos;t need the money .
everything isn &apos;t about money , jiminy .
it &apos;s about the principle .
a commitment to excellence .
excellence at stealing money .
now go ahead and take the &quot; elf tonic , &quot; jiminy .
such beautiful young people .
pardon me . uh , do you have a place at your hearth
for an honest man and his ... uh , elderly parents ?
of course . come in .
i &apos;ll heat up some broth .
oh , we love broth .
oh , what a beautiful home .
your cobbles are so even .
oh , and that &apos;s real thatch .
honey , that &apos;s a big ham .
thank you for your kindness .
i just can &apos;t get it out of my mind .
that family .
terrible way to go .
what ?
what happened ?
plague .
the next town over . we just passed through .
the plague ?
well , a plague , certainly .
is it coming here ? are you okay ?
oh , us ? no , we &apos;re immune .
we have elf tonic .
made by elves from elves .
four out of five court physicians recommend it .
fifth one died before he could try it .
well , you have it , right , smart folks like you ?
we &apos;ve never heard of it .
oh , no .
oh , dear god .
oh , no . you &apos;re going to die .
you need elf tonic .
oh , i wish we had extra .
we don &apos;t have extra .
there is no extra .
we could pay you .
we have a tiny bottle .
but we need that for ourselves .
what can we give you ?
surely there must be something here you would want .
i &apos;m sure we could come up with something .
well , i guess we should start loading up .
here you go .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
those are good people .
they--they would never have hurt us like that .
and that &apos;s where they went wrong .
it &apos;s better to be the kind of people that take ...
instead of those that get taken from .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve given me no other choice .
how frail do you think we are , son ?
rainwater won &apos;t hurt us .
i &apos;m pretty good at sleight of hand , jiminy .
you switched them ?
if this was the elf tonic ...
oh , my . we must have given whatever you had ...
to that family .
oh , i hope it wasn &apos;t dangerous .
oh , look at that .
new puppets for the act .
mama , papa !
who are you ?
mama ? papa ?
what did you do to them ?
what did you do to them ? !
henry ?
henry .
henry !
henry .
henry . henry . you gotta slow down .
there &apos;s something shiny down there .
henry , this is seriously dangerous .
we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
it could be something .
will you look at me ? ! look at me !
i &apos;m frightened for you , henry !
because you think i &apos;m crazy ?
no ! no .
because we are trapped underground
in an abandoned mine , henry ,
and there is no way out .
archie &apos;s smart .
he will keep the boy safe until we get to them .
watch out !
stop ! stop !
move , move , move !
you &apos;re making it worse !
i am trying to save him .
you know why he went in there in the first place , don &apos;t you ?
because you made him feel like he had something to prove .
and why does he think he has anything to prove ?
who &apos;s encouraging him ?
do not put this on me .
oh , please ! lecture me until his oxygen runs out !
henry , do you hear that ?
it &apos;s pongo !
follow the noise .
we have to stop this .
arguing won &apos;t accomplish anything .
no , it won &apos;t .
what do you want me to do ?
help me .
it &apos;s loudest , over here .
what &apos;s--what &apos;s this ?
looks like ...
an old elevator .
we need to find some way to ... punch through the ground .
we need something big .
like what ?
explosives .
it &apos;s to get the mine workers in and out .
goes all the way to the top . that &apos;s why we could hear pongo .
can we make it work ?
let &apos;s give it a shot .
okay . we &apos;re all clear .
come on !
blow it .
did it work ?
it didn &apos;t open .
then what did it do ?
have a good day .
where are you going ?
home . i &apos;m done for the day .
shouldn &apos;t you be resting ?
uh , actually , dr. whale wants me to start physical therapy .
i &apos;m supposed to walk 30 minutes a day
on the treadmill or outside with an escort ,
but they &apos;re kinda short on personnel
because of that thing that happened at the mine .
so ... maybe if there was a volunteer
willing to help ?
i &apos;m trying to remember this place .
it &apos;s like ... it &apos;s like i woke up in some strange land .
is anything coming back ?
what about when you &apos;re with her ?
you remembered your dog .
yeah . i lied .
you did ?
she &apos;s just so loving , you know ?
i didn &apos;t want to disappoint her ...
but none of it feels right , you know ?
a dog named ajax ? who would name a dog that ?
none of it makes sense . none of it ...
none of it feels real .
that sounds lonely .
actually , one thing does feel real .
you .
what ?
i know it &apos;s crazy , but i swear ,
you &apos;re the only thing in this whole place
that feels ...
that feels right .
kathryn .
right .
kathryn , uh , wh--
you &apos;re here .
i know it &apos;s outside of visiting hours , but , uh ...
i needed to see you .
i made some cranberry muffins .
they used to be your favorite .
well , i should leave you two .
wait . mary margaret .
see you tomorrow ?
what was that ?
what the hell was that ? you said you could do this !
madam mayor i realize that--
madam mayor .
they could have killed my son !
i know , but this isn &apos;t helping .
if we knew exactly where they were ,
we could drill down to them ,
maybe ... maybe rig something to bring them back up .
but drill where ?
come on , buddy .
what do you think--
it &apos;s archie &apos;s dog .
he &apos;s found something .
look .
this is where they must be . what is it ?
good boy . good boy . good boy .
what is that ?
it &apos;s an air shaft .
i &apos;m ... really ...
really ...
really sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
i just wanted to find proof .
no , it &apos;s really all right , henry .
i mean , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry , too .
look , i @-@ i don &apos;t think you &apos;re crazy .
i @-@ i just--i just think that you &apos;ve got a very strong mother
who &apos;s got a clear idea of the path
that she wants you to be on ,
and when you step off that , she ...
she gets scared , and , you know , that &apos;s natural ,
but it &apos;s also natural for you to be able to be free
to think the things that you want to think .
so ...
anyway , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean those things i said ,
and i @-@ i never should have said &apos; em .
then ... why did you ?
i guess i &apos;m just not a very good person .
i &apos;m not the man i want to be .
okay . all right . gun it .
okay , stop . we got it .
all right .
so ? what &apos;s next ?
i think you can be him .
i think you can be a good person .
i mean , you &apos;re jiminy cricket .
henry . henry , jiminy cricket was a , uh ,
he was a cricket , okay , and he was a conscience ,
and--and i hardly think that &apos;s me .
but before you said he was a guy who took a long time
to figure out the right thing to do .
that kinda sounds like me .
now it &apos;s harder for you , because of the curse ,
to hear the voice inside of you ,
to be who you want to be .
we need to lower someone straight down ,
or the line will collapse the sides of the shaft .
i &apos;ve got a harness .
lower me down .
oh , no way . i &apos;m going .
he &apos;s my son .
he &apos;s my son , too .
you &apos;ve been sitting behind a desk for ten years .
i can do this .
just bring him to me .
hey . can i ask you again ?
ask what ?
why do you think it &apos;s so important that
your fairy tale theory is true ?
i don &apos;t know .
give it a shot .
&apos;cause ...
this can &apos;t be all there is .
i understand .
and i thought if i found proof ...
mm . but i didn &apos;t find anything .
well , that &apos;s not true .
i was lost , and you found me , right ?
you mean , you remember ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t remember ,
but i @-@ i do remember the kind of person i want to be .
i just gotta listen harder .
what &apos;s that ?
i think it &apos;s a rescue .
are you guys okay ?
yeah , we &apos;re--we &apos;re okay .
hang on , henry .
okay . that &apos;s good . stop .
uhh . here you go . up .
come on . i gotcha .
okay . all right . i got him .
you got him ? is he safe ?
archie .
it &apos;s gonna fall !
i &apos;m sorry !
it &apos;s okay !
thank you .
are you okay ?
deputy , you can clear the crowd away .
thank you , dr. hopper .
i have something to say .
i &apos;m gonna continue to treat henry ,
and i &apos;m gonna do it my own way .
my relief at his safety
hasn &apos;t changed a thing , dr. hopper .
you will do as i say , or you--
or what ? you &apos;ll ruin my life ?
you &apos;ll do your worst ?
because i will always do my best .
don &apos;t test me .
oh , i don &apos;t need to , because you &apos;re gonna leave me alone
and let me do my work in peace .
really ? why is that ?
because someday , madam mayor ,
you may find yourself in a custody battle ,
and do you know how the court determines who is a fit parent ?
they consult an expert ,
particularly one who has treated the child .
so ... i suggest that you think about that
and you allow me to do my work
and let me do it the way my conscience tells me to .
i wish ...
i wish ...
i hear your wish .
you don &apos;t need to wish it so loudly .
but it is not possible .
i cannot bring back the boy &apos;s parents .
it &apos;s my fault .
i have to make it right . i ...
i would trade my life to make it happen .
what &apos;s done is done ,
but there may be another way .
tell me , please .
the little boy ...
he will grow up to face many challenges .
do you want to help him ?
i can &apos;t get away from these people .
they &apos;re my parents .
they &apos;re ...
who i am .
but if you didn &apos;t want to be that ,
what would you like to be ?
i hear your wish .
how do you feel ?
find the boy , jiminy .
you will live as many years as you need to help him .
just find him .
his name is geppetto .
is that archie &apos;s father ?
no . they &apos;re just old friends .
you really scared me .
i &apos;m sorry .
gentlemen . well , come on .
your mom wants to take you home .
listen .
crickets .
they &apos;re back .
things are changing .
