ugh ! good job today , brenda .
thanks , keith . this was a great haul .
yeah . they were really biting today . it &apos;s been a while .
why don &apos;t you head back to town .
i want to put the rest in the smoker .
i &apos;ll drop you off .
no . i could do with the walk .

ok . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
all right . see you .

is really going to answer you .
keith ?
stop messing around . it &apos;s not funny .
oh , it &apos;s you .
i thought someone was--
jj , that &apos;s not the point .
well , are you gonna call him ?
maybe .
emily .
mick rawson is an arrogant ,
oversexed , egotistical--
hot british dude with a sexy accent , badge , and gun .
just your type .
you know what ? i don &apos;t even get you sometimes .
it wouldn &apos;t go anywhere .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know our work schedules .
ok , you know what ? will and i make it work .
oh . oh , no .
i know . i know . i know . don &apos;t say it .
but when you see what &apos;s in here ...
and it &apos;s not my fault .
they were calling to me , i swear .
and they were all on sale .
and when you think about it ,
that means that i am helping the economy ,
which is more than i can say for you guys ,
&apos;cause no one else has bags .
yeah . please tell me all of those aren &apos;t for my son .
they &apos;re not .
good .
this one is for kevin .
what ? it is my duty as a fairy godmother to spoil the child .
and henry is finally old enough to be fun when opening presents .
i &apos;m not taking them back .
give me my coffee and no one &apos;s gonna get hurt .
oh , uh , half @-@ caf extra shot venti , 2 @-@ pump nonfat ,
hold the whip caramel macchiato .
mm @-@ hmm . next stop , xanadu .
oh , wait .
uh ... xana @-@ don &apos;t .
time to go to the bau , ladies .
maybe i should get a cat .
sorry to ruin your night .
what , are you working on wife number 4 ?
i see you people way too much .
let &apos;s get started .
all right . anchorage field office is asking us
to investigate a series of murders in franklin , alaska .
there &apos;s 3 people dead in less than a week .
for a town with a population of 1,476,
that &apos;s fairly significant .
it &apos;s their first murder investigation on record .
who are the victims ?
uh , jon baker , a hunter .
dedaimia swanson , a schoolteacher .
brenda bright , the first mate on a fishing boat .
there &apos;s a new victim every 2 days .
any connections ?
unfortunately , in a town this small , everyone &apos;s connected .
different kill methods .
it says the first two victims were both shot with a rifle ,
but brenda bright was stabbed twice with an arrow ?
are we sure it &apos;s the same guy ?
all 3 victims were found in heavily trafficked areas .
the unsub wants them found sooner than later .
jon baker &apos;s body was left exposed to the elements ,
but the two women were buried under mounds of trash . why ?
it could be a sign of remorse .
cover their bodies so he doesn &apos;t have to face
the reality of what he &apos;s done .
or he thinks that the women are trash
and he &apos;s just placed them where he thinks they belong .
well , we can &apos;t be sure of anything yet .
franklin is an isolated fishing community
that &apos;s been hit really hard by the current economy .
add to that a series of unsolved murders and everyone &apos;s on edge .
the local sheriff &apos;s out of his depth .
and alaska hasn &apos;t handled a serial investigation
since robert hansen in the eighties .
we &apos;ll fly out tonight . everybody can sleep on the plane .
garcia , i need you with us .
sir ?
i &apos;ve tasked a satellite uplink
and it &apos;s your job to keep us connected .
yes , sir .
this town &apos;s already on the brink ,
and if this pattern continues , we &apos;ve only got another day
until the next murder . let &apos;s finish this fast .
&quot; nature in her most dazzling aspects or stupendous parts ,
&quot; is but the background and theater of the tragedy of man . &quot;
john morley .
this guy &apos;s all over the map .
crosses sex and race boundaries .
he changed his kill method .
it says to me he &apos;s disorganized .
yet there weren &apos;t prints at any of the crime scenes ,
and he isolated his victims .
wearing gloves and making sure there aren &apos;t any witnesses--
that &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
but what concerns me is the evolution of the kills .
evolution ?
well , he started with easy prey .
jon baker was in his mid sixties .
it &apos;s relatively low @-@ risk for a first @-@ timer .
dedaimia swanson was in her early fifties .
she wouldn &apos;t be that difficult to overpower .
but he didn &apos;t have to overpower either one of them .
both victims were shot .
which is my point exactly .
he killed them both from a safe distance .
but brenda bright was younger , more athletic .
she would have been able to put up much more of a fight ,
so why not shoot her , too ?
that supports the disorganized theory .
maybe he didn &apos;t get what he wanted from his first two victims .
brenda bright was an attractive woman .
he used an arrow , but he didn &apos;t shoot her with it .
he stabbed her .
i think we all know what that means .
when we land in anchorage ,
there &apos;ll be a float plane to take us to franklin .
when we get there , morgan and prentiss work the crime scene .
we need to know exactly how he ambushed his victims .
reid and rossi , the bodies . find out what you can there .
jj and i will work victimology . and , garcia , town records .
find us something we can use .
of course , sir . i should let everybody know
that reception in the area is unreliable at best .
i &apos;m giving everybody satellite phones for communication ,
and i &apos;ve already preprogrammed all your digits into speed dial .
guess who &apos;s lucky number 7 .
welcome to franklin . i &apos;m deputy flack .
are these the docks that brenda bright was working
the night she was killed ?
yes .
all right , we &apos;ll get started here .
agent hotchner ?
yes , sir .
sheriff rhodes . very nice to meet you .
good to meet you , sir , ma &apos;am .
so i cannot tell you how grateful i am
that you all could come .
the people here are really starting to act up .
i &apos;m afraid our little town &apos;s a bit of a powder keg .
where would you like us to set up , sir ?
you see , there &apos;s not much room at the station
because that &apos;s also the post office .
but i have made arrangements for you to work out of carol &apos;s tavern ,
which is right over there .
thank you .
well , thank you . appreciate it .
it &apos;s pretty isolated out here .
how do you get basic supplies ?
float planes bring grocery and hardware deliveries
on a weekly basis , and fishermen and hunters provide
the town &apos;s meat supply .
hey . i &apos;m craig ramey . you all the fbi ?
what gave us away ?
you &apos;re sure packing an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip .
i &apos;m not going fishing . getting the hell out of dodge
before it &apos;s me or my wife put in the ground .
did you know brenda well ?
everyone did .
she was sweet .
she &apos;s pull a haul just as good as any guy on these docks .
as soon as i get my house boarded up , i &apos;m heading out .
suggest you do the same , susan .
excuse me
i can &apos;t say that i blame him .
with what &apos;s been going on ,
i &apos;m surprised more people aren &apos;t trying to leave .
this is keith graves .
he was with brenda the night she died .
mr. graves ,
did you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder ?
no . i offered to wait for her ,
but she insisted i head up to town without her .
what were you two doing that night ?
we finished for the day . i left .
she stuck around to clean the fish that she wanted to take home .
she usually walk home alone ?
yeah . brenda said that walking was good for the soul .
how far is it into town ?
about a half a mile .
the unsub could have waited for her anywhere .
appreciate your time .
sheriff asked me to keep everyone on ice till you got here .
still , i can &apos;t believe someone from franklin
would be capable of this .
what convinced you she was stabbed with the arrow
instead of shot ?
upward angle at the point of entry .
he would have had to been shooting from beneath her .
there wasn &apos;t much left . forest got to him first .
i found urine on the remains .
urine ?
i thought it was from the animals who scavenged his body ,
but i got the lab results back this morning .
the urine was human .
is he marking his victims ?
only found it on jon .
both the women were clean .
jon was shot 3 times .
the unsub grazed him twice and then hit him in the head .
dedaimia swanson was only shot once .
the first kill shows hesitation , uncertainty .
he wasn &apos;t confident taking the terminal shot .
it was either accidental or spur of the moment ,
but the second kill , he only needed one shot .
he &apos;s progressing quickly .
were you close with the victims ?
an occupational hazard when you &apos;re the only doctor in town .
i delivered brenda . never thought i &apos;d outlive her .
look at the cuts on her torso .
they &apos;re shallow and non @-@ penetrating .
not necessary for the murder .
you know what ? these were made postmortem .
he &apos;s playing with the bodies ,
experimenting with his methodology .
someone incapable of remorse .
we &apos;re dealing with a psychopath .
have you determined whether or not she was raped ?
i didn &apos;t even think to look .
your report says the assault occurred here .
that &apos;s right . there was a trail of blood
coming from that direction .
i don &apos;t see any blood .
we covered it up . you contaminated the scene ?
we had to . we &apos;ve got a rabid bear in the woods .
it &apos;s been ripping smaller game to shreds .
a creature like that smells blood ,
he &apos;ll come into town , no hesitation .
ok , you said the other two victims were found similar to this ?
jon was found on the edge of the woods .
dedaimia was up by crest falls .
it &apos;s a popular hiking route .
who would know their routines ?
everyone .
cup of coffee , jace ?
what are you doing ?
trying to make this place a little less analog .
sorry . i forget my hacker jokes aren &apos;t funny .
my name is penelope .
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t carry a weapon ,
aside from my biting wit .
and my job includes combining my kick @-@ ass systems
with your sheriff &apos;s department database
to get the skinny on your neighbors and you .
or you could just ask us what you want to know .
i mean , isn &apos;t it better to just talk to us directly
than look up our dirt secretly ?
no . because in my experience ,
the information superhighway never lies and people do .
your name would be ?
josh . my mom carol , she owns the place .
it goes like this .
here we are .
joshua beardsley , age 23,
born right here in franklin , ak .
moved to anchorage for middle and high school .
majored in hotel management at seattle u.
and you moved back home a few weeks ago .
perfect timing , huh ?
i come home , people start dying .
hmm . that &apos;s when i check your criminal record .
and you , my friend , are clean as a whistle .
what does that even mean ?
no idea .
no dirt , anyway , so , i guess i &apos;m safe , then ?
for now .
those two got into it last night .
bob here , he &apos;s our newest resident , so , uh ,
tom figures , well , this is the guy who &apos;s doing all the killings .
he decides to smash him over the head with a bottle of booze .
look , i don &apos;t know what to do .
have you thought about having a kind of town hall meeting
where you get everybody together
and talk about the facts of the case ?
the town &apos;s too spread out . i mean ,
everybody &apos;s doing what they can just to get by , you know ?
sheriff , i know people move
to these remote locations to be left alone ,
but what happened last night is gonna keep happening ,
and people are going to start taking matters into their own hands .
well , i can keep order in my own town ,
but people around here , i mean ,
this is alaska , man .
they do what they want .
he &apos;s already experimenting with his victims .
he violated brenda bright with an arrow .
and he &apos;s inciting panic .
people who have lived here most of their lives
are packing up to leave .
can you blame them ? we have a psychopath
whose hunting ground is a town of 1,400 people .
most of them grew up learning to kill animals and start fires .
it sounds like your basic survival skills .
no . they &apos;re hunting skills .
think about it . the marksmanship ,
the urine-- it makes sense .
the urine makes sense ?
it &apos;s a hunter &apos;s trick .
you urinate downwind to keep the animals away .
he tried to preserve jon baker &apos;s body
so it would be discovered intact .
all right , so we &apos;ve got a psychopath with hunting skills
who knows the routines of everyone in town .
how are we supposed to keep everyone safe ?
sheriff , i suggest you institute a curfew
until we have the unsub in custody . nobody out after dark .
i &apos;ll have one of my deputies patrolling around the clock .
garcia , how &apos;s it coming with town records ?
i &apos;ve run everyone who &apos;s been printed through codis .
nothing &apos;s come up so far . i &apos;m gonna pull an all @-@ nighter ,
finish going through the town records .
should have background checks by sunrise .
good . the rest of us should get some sleep ,
start fresh in the morning .
i &apos;ve got 4 of the upstairs rooms available .
uh , 4 ?
come on , that &apos;s the best we can do .
your team is double the size of my department .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
good night .
it looks like we &apos;ll have to double up .
i &apos;m not sleeping with reid .
dibs .
what do you mean , you &apos;re sharing a room with morgan ?
oh , you &apos;re jealous .
jealous ? why ?
because you &apos;re bedding down with a ...
muscle @-@ bound , modern @-@ day 007 ?
mm , he &apos;s more like jason bourne .
oh , what &apos;s there to be jealous about ?
he took the floor .
ok . just ... just make sure
he keeps his weapon holstered , ok ?
why are you up right now , anyway ? it &apos;s so late .
actually , it &apos;s early . i just got to quantico .
ohh . damn time zones .
hello ?
hello ?
hello .
ohh ... frak .
oh , come on , baby .
come on , come on , come on .
nice one , garcie .
look at me .
hey . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
my name &apos;s penelope .
you &apos;re gonna be ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
just keep looking at me .
help !
help !
please !
somebody come help here !
someone is hurt !
please !
his name &apos;s craig ramey . fisherman .
morgan and i met him this morning .
he was packing up to leave .
he &apos;s accelerating his schedule .
we should have had another day . why change that ?
ramey was pretty vocal about wanting to get out of town .
if the unsub knew that , he could have struck early
to prevent his target from getting away .
there has to be more to it than that .
he brought the body to the tavern we &apos;re staying at .
he &apos;s telling us that he &apos;s not afraid of us .
he &apos;s gaining confidence .
he switched to a hunting knife .
looks like a jagged edge .
there &apos;s more physical damage , too , like he was cut open .
i won &apos;t know until dr. johnson does an autopsy ,
but i &apos;d be willing to bet he took a piece of the victim with him .
what kind of piece ?
it &apos;s hard to say , but judging from the location ,
i would guess liver or spleen .
he was alive .
what ?
he was still alive .
baby , there &apos;s nothing else you could have done .
i felt him leave .
he was there one second , and then--
just a body .
i &apos;m really sorry that you had to see all of that .
derek , i--i didn &apos;t see , i was in it .
i was sort of used to seeing horrible things
from the safety of my screens every day ,
but this was ... right there .
why didn &apos;t you go and find someone before you ran out there ?
because when i got shot , i remember thinking
the last thing i &apos;m ever gonna see in this life
is the man who killed me ,
and i couldn &apos;t let that happen to him .
he had to see something good before he died .
you ran right towards the unsub . you could have been killed .
i know that . don &apos;t treat me like i &apos;m the victim .
all right . i &apos;m sorry .
i want to ask you a couple of questions , all right ?
no . i--i told you everything i saw .
you said the man &apos;s face was mostly in shadow ,
but there was also a lot of blood on it .
you might have seen more than you actually realize .
no . cognitive interviews ,
breaking someone &apos;s death down to a science
and statistic-- that is your world , derek .
not mine ! i will help from mine .
penelope !
derek , let her go .
will you look after her , please ?
yeah , of course .
was garcia able to give you any new information ?
she &apos;s given all she can .
this guy &apos;s taunting us . he &apos;s one step ahead .
i think you &apos;re giving him more credit than he deserves .
it &apos;s like emily said on the plane , he &apos;s all over the place .
the victimology &apos;s inconsistent .
the methodology &apos;s evolving .
the first kill was sloppy , hesitant , and unplanned .
it was an accident .
but it triggered a sexual response . he got off on it .
and he knew then and there he had to kill again .
he learned how to get the job done more efficiently .
yeah , but why the organs ?
consumption typically indicates a desire
to keep the victim with them .
he &apos;s having trouble letting go .
we &apos;re probably looking for someone
with severe abandonment issues .
it &apos;ll be light soon . let &apos;s get everybody together
and go over what we know .
we &apos;re looking for an emotionally immature male ,
probably in his mid to late twenties ,
who suffered a traumatic loss .
now , this loss could be anything .
death of a parent , separation of a spouse ,
a loved one who moved away .
something that made the unsub feel abandoned and alone .
he &apos;ll have extensive hunting experience .
the bodies were buried not because of remorse ,
they were buried to protect them from wild animals .
his familiarity with the victims &apos; routines
suggests the unsub has lived here for most of his life .
he also has extensive knowledge
of the landscape and surroundings .
so we should split up and cover the town .
focus on younger residents with a history of
petty crimes and assaults .
you should look in their trash ,
fireplaces , even in laundry .
look for signs of bloody clothes or even cuts and bruises .
one of the victims may have gotten in a good blow or two
before they died .
bring in anyone who seems to have something to hide .
the unsub has already broken patterns ,
so he could strike again at any time .
sheriff , you and i need to look at the school ,
talk to the teacher , see if she remembers any students exhibiting
early signs of homicidal tendencies .
let &apos;s move .
dedaimia was only one month away from retirement .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
i need to ask about your former students .
do you remember any of them enjoying hunting too much ,
so much that it worried you ?
all the boys around here like it too much .
they have competitions to see who &apos;s the better shot .
this would have been extreme .
do you remember anyone who might have tortured animals
or played with them before he killed them ?
does that sound like someone you know ?
i &apos;ve never seen anyone enjoy hunting
as much as joshua beardsley .
he &apos;s the tavern owner &apos;s son ?
yeah .
the youngest boy in town to bag a deer .
that &apos;s all he ever talked about .
he hunted something nearly every day .
he was born and raised here .
he returned a couple of weeks ago after his dad died .
how old is he ?
23 ?
sure .
we need to talk to him .
all right .
thank you .
what &apos;s this about ?
the strike was above the gut .
it keeps the meat from spoiling . isn &apos;t that right ?
on a deer , maybe .
doubt it &apos;d be the same for a human .
but then he did something interesting .
he took the victim &apos;s spleen .
now , tell me ,
why would he do that ?
no idea .
let &apos;s stop playing games , joshua .
answer my questions and maybe i &apos;ll believe you .
it &apos;s a native hunting tradition , isn &apos;t it ?
eat part of the kill .
gain the life force of your prey .
not many people know that .
i &apos;m not many people .
where did you learn to hunt ?
bagged my first deer when i was 7 .
that &apos;s pretty young .
my dad taught me how to live off the land .
i ate the heart of my first kill .
that proves you &apos;re a true hunter .
so , you , um , enjoy hunting ?
it &apos;s my favorite thing to do .
then would you say you take pleasure in the kill ?
doesn &apos;t everyone ?
actually , no ...
they don &apos;t .
what do you think ?
i &apos;m not sure .
he fits the profile ,
but he &apos;s acting like a man with nothing to hide .
the attack cycle &apos;s accelerating . he should strike tonight .
and if he doesn &apos;t , we know we &apos;ve got our guy in custody .
and what if he does ?
look , i hate to say it ,
but half this town matches most of your profile .
hey . what are you guys working on ?
hotch asked if we &apos;d go through garcia &apos;s background profiles ,
try to find a link between joshua and the 4 victims .
you find anything ?
they all had hunting licenses .
needle , meet haystack .
yeah , we need the big guns .
ripped and ready to rumble .
uh , maybe you should sit this one out .
no , jaje , i &apos;m ok .
put this bastard where he belongs .
joshua beardsley ?
yeah . we think he &apos;s our unsub .
no , he &apos;s not .
he fits the profile .
abandonment issue triggered by his father &apos;s recent death .
hunting experience ,
reid--
experimentation with animals .
reid .
you arrested my son ?
we brought him in as a precaution .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not him .
what makes you so sure ?
because the unsub ran away from me .
of course he ran . he knew you were fbi .
but joshua knows i &apos;m a techie .
he knows i don &apos;t carry a weapon .
if he was the unsub , i &apos;d be dead right now .
how can you be listening to any of this , steve ?
you know joshua would never do this .
look , i never thought any of us were capable of doing this .
but 4 people are dead , carol .
you don &apos;t know him . he &apos;s a good boy .
he &apos;s a good boy who recently lost his father
and it &apos;s a lot of emotional stress .
it &apos;s been tough , but we &apos;re coping .
he &apos;s doing fine .
why did he move back to town ?
i needed him here to help with the inn .
i can &apos;t handle it on my own .
and how did that make him feel ,
having to drop everything and move back home ?
he didn &apos;t do this .
we need to be sure .
i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m his mother .
carol , it &apos;s one night .
if nothing happens , you pick him up in the morning .
wait a minute . you said the unsub has abandonment issues .
and craig ramey was leaving town , right ?
yeah , he couldn &apos;t wait to get out of town .
ok .
uh ... let &apos;s see .
dedaimia swanson was retiring in a month .
she was moving to florida .
what about the other two ?
un , jon baker just bought property in fairbanks ,
and he and his wife just separated .
she just filed the divorce papers .
well , welcome back , red delicious .
take a bite out of this . so far , 3 of our victims
were on the fast track to getting out of town . and let &apos;s see ...
connect 4 . brenda just accepted a job in seattle .
anyone else look like they might be leaving town ?
um ... i got one .
kat allen .
she was accepted to the summer honors program
at the university of bloomington .
she currently works as a waitress at big john &apos;s coffeehouse .
penelope , you are--
so ready to go home .
prentiss .
hi . we &apos;re looking for kat allen .
i &apos;m kat .
can we talk ?
it was completely unexpected .
never been married .
i &apos;d given up on ever having kids .
do you mind my asking who the father is ?
a guy i met on a cruise .
he doesn &apos;t want anything to do with her .
but i do . i want to be able to give her a good life ,
so i &apos;m going back to school .
did you tell anyone that you were leaving ?
yeah . a couple of people .
uh , i don &apos;t know ...
my mom . my boss .
we &apos;re going to need you to come with us .
why ? what &apos;s this about ?
it &apos;s just for tonight . it &apos;s for your protection .
damn it .
the neighbors saw the door open , called it in .
he went from ambushing people in public to home invasion .
that &apos;s a pretty big change in m.o.
this one &apos;s personal . it &apos;s angry .
her intestines are splayed out everywhere .
yeah . and the blood on her face is smeared ,
not splattered .
he played with the body . he mutilated her .
if this guy &apos;s killing people leaving town ,
why didn &apos;t he attack kat allen ?
because we had her in protective custody .
he couldn &apos;t get to her , so he moved on to another target .
a target who broke her routine .
carol was scheduled to be at the tavern tonight .
how did the unsub know she was here ?
he was stalking her .
he chose carol for a different reason .
why ? what &apos;s changed ?
you guys finally realize i &apos;m innocent ?
joshua , please have a seat .
more questions ?
you serious ?
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t do this .
we know that , son .
please , sit down .
what &apos;s going on ?
josh , the--the killer struck again last night .
oh , god .
who did he get ?
why are you guys only telling me this ?
where &apos;s my mom ?
no .
no .
no . no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , that &apos;s impossible .
she--she was just here .
i--i just talked to her !
i &apos;m sorry , joshua . she &apos;s gone .
oh , no . no , no , no , no . no , no . you--
you &apos;re lying .
i wish we were .
i need to see her .
not right now .
you don &apos;t want to think of her that way .
joshua , we know you need time to mourn ,
but the fact of the matter is , the man who did this
is still out there , and we think that you can help us find him .
you had me locked up
while she was--
i could have helped her .
if you had gone to her ,
there &apos;s a good chance you &apos;d both be dead .
now we need your help .
why me ?
the murders began when you returned to town .
now , up until now , he &apos;s only targeted people
who were trying to leave , but for some reason ,
with your mother , it was personal .
the pressure &apos;s on . the fbi is here .
in that situation , a serial killer wants to finish what he started ,
he goes after the true target of his cause .
personal ?
can you think of anyone who had a grudge against her ?
anyone at all ?
how about anyone with a grudge against you ?
no . no . everybody loved her .
the man that we &apos;re looking for has severe abandonment issues .
now , can you think of a time
when you or your mother left somebody ,
maybe like a bad break @-@ up or a fight that ended a friendship ?
did your mother ever take anyone in at the inn
who had family problems ,
maybe someone who had been kicked out
or lost someone unexpectedly ?
no . no , no , no , no , there was nothing like that .
uh , listen , can i go see my mom now ?
josh . josh , you need to let these people help .
no , i need-- i need to see my mom .
well , let &apos;s have someone take you .
it &apos;s ok . i know the way .
did you see his behavior shift
from wanting to help us to wanting to leave ? he &apos;s lying .
because he knows who the unsub is .
i got one of my deputies tailing joshua .
if he does something stupid , we &apos;re gonna know .
there &apos;s got to be a connection we &apos;re missing .
garcia , anything ?
their lives have been torn apart ,
figuratively and literally , and i can &apos;t find anything .
try again .
i &apos;m hacking into his college database as we speak .
maybe there &apos;s something about his life in seattle i may have missed .
good . all right , why carol ?
why the mutilation ? why the overkill ?
mutilation ?
you said you found the remains of mutilated animals
in the woods from a rabid bear ? that &apos;s right .
did you take pictures of them ?
of course we did .
we documented everything for identification .
we &apos;ll need to see those pictures right away .
sheriff , we need to adjust the profile .
what do you mean ?
these animals weren &apos;t mutilated by a rabid bear .
someone did this .
you mean a person .
an animal wouldn &apos;t have left so much .
we should have seen it before .
it &apos;s homicidal triad 101 .
we said the kills were all over the map .
the unsub lacks sophistication and shows immaturity
in his kills because he is immature .
he started with animals because that &apos;s what he was taught
ever since he was a child .
and when he got bored with animals ,
he moved on to more challenging prey .
people .
your unsub &apos;s a teenage boy .
the boy we were talking about before ,
he wouldn &apos;t be a former student , he &apos;d be a current student ,
a teenager who loves to hunt .
i only have two teenagers right now .
both of them are girls .
go ahead , garcia .
i found something uber weird .
in joshua &apos;s college application essay ,
he talks about the impact
that being an older brother had on his life .
i thought he didn &apos;t have any siblings .
he doesn &apos;t , and yet he &apos;s talking
about how hard it was to leave him behind
when he moved to anchorage ,
to leave him unprotected .
thanks .
was there a student that joshua may have taken under his wing
before he moved away ?
someone you may have suspected was being abused ?
oh , my god .
what ?
owen porter .
he &apos;s not a student anymore . he &apos;s home @-@ schooled .
joshua and he were attached at the hip when they were younger .
i &apos;ve been called out to the porter house several times .
domestic disturbance .
owen and his mom always covering for the dad .
let &apos;s go .
thanks .
talk about abandonment issues .
owen was left victim to the abusive hand of his father .
joshua &apos;s return probably derailed owen &apos;s mental stability .
add to that the accidental shooting of jon baker and he snapped .
he got off on that first killing .
he had to do it again .
so he targeted people trying to leave town .
in his mind , when people leave , he gets hurt .
and he resented carol for taking joshua away ,
so he killed her to make sure he never left again .
where would he go now ?
we &apos;re surrounded by waterways and mountains .
he could be anywhere .
mr. porter , is your son at home ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
turn that off .
did you know ?
don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
not for sure .
not until last night .
he came home covered in blood .
he &apos;s not here . but the window &apos;s open .
it &apos;s not the first time
you &apos;ve washed blood out of his clothes , is it ?
don &apos;t answer them , martha !
sit down and shut up .
i promise he will not lay a hand on you again .
no .
it wasn &apos;t the first time .
mrs. porter , i understand you &apos;re only trying to protect owen ,
but you can &apos;t anymore .
he &apos;s always been different .
he &apos;s not like us .
when he was a little boy , he used to go out into the woods
and come home covered in blood .
why didn &apos;t you tell anyone , martha ?
how could you just sit there and do nothing while people died ?
how did owen react when joshua was sent away ?
he wanted to leave , too .
but i couldn &apos;t let him .
mrs. porter , do you have any idea what social isolation does to a child ?
i was afraid of what he might do if he ever left here .
we knew .
we knew what he was .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
what is it ?
joshua managed to shake deputy stiller .
and someone reported a hunting party going into the woods .
oh , god .
they &apos;re hunting owen .
listen .
that way . go .
you have him ?
no . he &apos;s moving too fast .
looks like he &apos;s circling back towards town .
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky .
did they just shoot him ?
they wouldn &apos;t be shooting if they weren &apos;t close .
let &apos;s go .
do you know where he &apos;s headed ?
was there a place he went to be alone ?
a hiding spot when you were mad at him ?
hiding spot . how the hell are we supposed to know ?
if you know , you need to tell me .
i &apos;m trying to help him . there &apos;s a mob out there ,
and if they find him , they &apos;re not gonna turn him over .
they &apos;re gonna take justice into their own hands .
if you value your son &apos;s life , you need to help me .
martha , don &apos;t !
lake lafayette .
he and joshua built a fort there when they were younger .
you &apos;ll need a boat upriver to get there .
hold on , guys .
yeah , hotch , what &apos;s up ?
ok . i got it .
there &apos;s a new plan .
he &apos;s heading for the harbor .
owen , put the gun down .
drop it , son .
who do you want to take your chances with , us or them ?
drop the weapons and back away !
can &apos;t do that , agents .
the boy &apos;s coming with us .
it &apos;s not happening !
back down , keith . we &apos;re in control now .
what are you gonna do , steve ? he &apos;s 16 .
send him back to juvey so he &apos;s out in 2 years ?
he killed brenda .
he killed my mom .
he needs help and he will be held accountable for his crimes .
accountable ? 5 people are dead .
why &apos;d you do it , owen ? huh ? why &apos;d you kill her ?
you left me behind .
you killed my mom !
she sent you away ! you left and you didn &apos;t come back .
8 years and i never heard from you again .
please , just let us take him in .
sorry . i can &apos;t . i know what you &apos;re saying is right ,
but i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m terribly sorry for your loss ,
but please just put your guns down so no one else gets hurt .
are you kidding ? you &apos;re outnumbered and outgunned .
who do you think has the higher ground here ?
i &apos;m pretty sure we do !
i don &apos;t know .
what are you-- what are you doing ?
we can still take him !
it &apos;s over , joshua .
he killed my mom .
i know ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
you shot him ?
he &apos;ll live .
it sucks , doesn &apos;t it ?
what ?
just knowing that we couldn &apos;t have done any of this without you .
yeah , pretty much .
i &apos;m proud of you , penelope .
despite everything that happened , you came back ...
and you got the job done .
the sight of blood used to make me run away .
and two nights ago i ran towards it .
it means you &apos;re changing into someone stronger than you realize .
you cared enough to risk your own life to try and save someone else .
yeah , but ...
what &apos;s the difference between being strong and being jaded ?
i &apos;m scared , derek .
i don &apos;t want to lose who i am just so i can do this job .
we are in one of the most beautiful places on earth .
i know you see that , don &apos;t you ?
yeah
then we have nothing to worry about .
it &apos;s who you are , baby girl .
you see the beauty in everything and everyone
no matter where you go .
that part of you is never gonna change , and i won &apos;t let it .
i don &apos;t need you to protect me .
tough . i think i &apos;m gonna stay on the job a little while longer .
yeah ?
mm @-@ hmm .
how much longer ?
every day of my life .
i kind of love you , derek morgan .
i kinda love you , penelope garcia .
