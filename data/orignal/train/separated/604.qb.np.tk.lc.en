chang , the audition &apos;s at 3.00 .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t go , you know , maybe i &apos;m a bad actor .
being good is a fraction of acting .
it takes discipline and confidence .
discipline , confidence .
okay from the top .
always scare danielson .
miyagi hate fighting .
line .
i heard karate kid quotes .
chang is auditioning for the stage adaptation of karate kid downtown .
yeah , and it &apos;s for the part of daniel larusso .
you got a problem with that , racist ?
no , you &apos;re acting now ?
yeah you got a problem with that ?
i &apos;m clear .
they took my snake , and they turned it into a plumber .
they made the eggs , into barrels .
the pine tree they made into a gorilla ,
but i recognized my design .
donkey kong my ass .
that &apos;s construction snake .
i don &apos;t practice law anymore .
but , we have a case , right ?
isn &apos;t everyone you &apos;d be suing dead ?
that &apos;s not cool , man .
why would a tree throw eggs at a snake ?
why would a papal be fighting a monkey ?
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know .
the wi @-@ fi &apos;s still broken .
what happened to good morning ?
it &apos;s a bad morning , no wi @-@ fi .
yeah , we really need wi @-@ fi .
okay , let &apos;s not get carried away .
we need oxygen .
we have oxygen , we need wi @-@ fi .
wi @-@ fi , wi @-@ fi , wi @-@ fi .
okay , enough , right ?
look what i &apos;m doing , look .
fix , wi @-@ fi .
mm @-@ hm , okay , boom and boom .
all right .
i , i &apos;m trying to find the it lady .
所以才会收到乱码和高频声波
my emails to her get bounced back to me in aramaic ,
and when i call , i hear an undulating
high @-@ pitched whistle that makes my nose bleed .
well , sounds like a bad it lady , right ?
frankie , hire a new it lady .
i &apos;m pretty handy with technology .
i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s still the same , smaller holes , more bytes .
now what are we up to now , mega ?
tera .
tera .
they did it , those bastards . they finally did it .
frankie , hire elroy .
elroy , you &apos;re the it lady .
can i be his assistant ?
not for money .
can i be his friend ?
elroy abed is your friend .
now the real reason i came by ,
i &apos;m dying .
not really , but imagine how
bad you feel for complaining about the wi @-@ fi .
here &apos;s the real reason .
too short ?
it is too short ?
it &apos;s not too short ?
you people are no help .
school board come in .
school board , you &apos;re surrounded .
if this is about the bonfire ,
we &apos;ll put it out when the weather breaks .
we come in peace .
we &apos;ve had our ups and downs , but as of right now .
we love this school , and love what you &apos;re doing with it .
what ?
why ?
what would you think about moving up ?
joining us on the board ?
me ?
i would love to be on the school board .
awesome .
awesome .
one , one more thing .
you &apos;re gay , right ?
i mean , like openly gay .
i &apos;m not openly anything , and gay doesn &apos;t begin to cover it .
no , no .
oh , i get it .
this is about the uproar over you guys cancelling the pride parade ,
for a school board parade .
those guys get to dress fancy all year .
no , no .
we have one day !
no , this isn &apos;t about that .
this is about adding a new face to the board .
but , if that new face happened to be openly gay ,
it would be because we &apos;re so tolerant .
and always work .
but , that &apos;s for us to deal with .
the question you have to ask is , am i openly gay ?
because , if you are that gayness could be a rocket ,
thrusting you to new gay heights .
and if you &apos;re not .
well , there &apos;s a lot of gay guys out there .
i feel that &apos;s the selling point of the lifestyle .
you know , i , i , i never thought about it that way .
well , i have .
cutting women out of sex , it &apos;s genius .

this should lead to the router .
back up , back up , back up , back up back up back back .
wh , wh , what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s a birds nest in there , with babies in it .
the mother must have built it there because of the heat .
same reason my mom took my half brother to arizona .
that &apos;s probably why the wi @-@ fi &apos;s down ,
we &apos;ll have to move it .
if you move them the mother won &apos;t come back .
those birds aren &apos;t the new it lady , i am .
i &apos;ll move it carefully .
the mother won &apos;t come back .
kid , animals have been murdering each other for 3 billion years .
birds have had their 15 million in the spotlight .
the same as lizards and plants
and they all just use it to murder , eat , screw
and not invent wi @-@ fi .
now we may end up saving this one , or blowing it to hell or
making a new one .
but we can &apos;t do any of it while scheduling our evolution around
the needs of the least lucky birds .
what are you , a demon ? did clive barker write you ?
anyone who finds that nest , will come to the same decision .
and you don &apos;t have to get mean .
mean ?
you just did a baby bird murder monologue .
maybe they &apos;re close to leaving the nest ,
until then can &apos;t you just stall
by doing what real it people do ?
what &apos;s that ?
exactly .
i &apos;ve got one year to make it all work ,
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do ,
make it work , all of it .
this place is intimidating .
you &apos;re gonna do great .
next up , ben chang , for the role of daniel larusso .
thank you .
daniel @-@ san , why you want learn karate ?
hang on a second .
sorry , i can do better .
zip it .
who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m annie , a friend of chang &apos;s .
you mind coming up here and reading with your friend ?
okay , if it helps .
daniel @-@ san , what you want ?
okay , no , sorry , no .
you read daniel @-@ san .
you read miyagi .
we &apos;ll do scene seven , miyagi &apos;s office .
are you the repairman ?
aye .
the faucet &apos;s really leaky there .
aye .
when you gonna fix it ?
after .
after what .
after after .
tell everyone else to go home .
we got the parts !
here here .
parts plural ?
well yeah , annie got my part
and i got the asian part .
chang .
stop !
we were cast as mr. miagi and the karate kid ,
because we &apos;re a good team !
we &apos;re a team , because one
of us is so talented she got cast outside her
gender and the other one , got cast because of eye shape .
i am not letting you sabotage yourself like this .
let &apos;s say you &apos;re right .
and like sidney poitier or
meg ryan before you ,
you were cast for race .
it &apos;s what the actor does with the role they get , that matters .
all right ?
you &apos;re right .
all right it lady .
how goes it ?
i found your problem .
and ?
i &apos;ll need a little time to fix it .
wow , need time to fix it ?
you sound just like you work in it .
i &apos;ve got some interesting news ,
the school board , offered me a position .
great .
cool .
well i got a part in a play
and we were sort of talking about that ,
so read the room pelton .
are you gonna take the job ?
i don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a catch .
jeffery , frankie , could i see you in my office please ?
they want you to be a token homosexual ?
it &apos;s a form of progress , 30 years ago ,
the most power an openly gay could achieve was a center square .
曾经有几位公开出柜的明星上过该节目
but i &apos;m not just gay .
what does that mean ?
if coming out is a magic show ,
and gayness is the rabbit out of the hat ,
i &apos;m one of those , never in any handkerchiefs .
is that truth , craig ?
anything other than straight , is plenty gay for a school board .
the most important point is ,
are you prepared to make your sexuality ,
which is nobody &apos;s business ,
an aspect of your role in society ?
i know i &apos;m not , so i don &apos;t .
no ?
when a person becomes symbolic they gain symbolic power ,
at the price of independent power .
yep . that &apos;s an excellent point .
it could be good for greendale ,
for one of our own to be on the school board .
i mean the fact that you &apos;d be leaving a few items off
your list of your turn @-@ ons , i mean , the goal in politics ,
isn &apos;t transparency , it &apos;s winning .
that &apos;s why the politicians always win .
they do always win , don &apos;t they ?
but now i get a chance to win .
i could change the system from the inside out .
and all i have to do is pare down my sexuality to simple gayness ,
which is heavily in the mix .
there you go .
get ready america .
dean pelton is coming out
as approximately two @-@ sevenths of what he is .
come on .
don &apos;t leave me hanging .
there we go .
i am so curious .
intellectually .
all right .
this is a pretty basic scene .
no real subtext .
let &apos;s just get it up on its feet .
there &apos;s no wrong answers .
okay ? great .
go .
hey , come fix faucet .
oh , karate , learn from book ?
yeah .
and a few classes back at the y in jersey where i &apos;m from .
what happened eye ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
i guess there are wrong answers .
quick adjustment , ben .
yeah ?
act better .
act better .
thanks .
annie , you &apos;re doing great .
keep doing what you &apos;re doing .
can i ask about by motiv- .
keep me from puking is your motivation .
stop making me want to quit the theater and kill myself .
go .
after what happened i.
okay .
i fell off my bike .
lucky no hurt hand .
okay .
can i see this tool box ?
great . this is good .
got it .
i got distracted
cuz the tools were doing a better job than you .
what happened eye ?
say it .
what happened eye ?
liar .
stop lying to me .
say it .
what happened eye ?
what happened after ?
you crying ?
you cry when i tell you to cry .
so reabsorb that disgusting droplet of salt and
bad choices back into your doughy body .
and then call your mother
to see if you can be reabsorbed back into her
doughy body or so help me god ,
i will take that tear , i will freeze it , and
i will stab you in the eye with it ,
you waste of a soul @-@ shaped hole forgotten by god .
okay .
what should i.
annie , don &apos;t change a thing , you &apos;re perfect .
unless you want to .
okay .
all right i &apos;m reg county , this is my man carl .
we work on the school board .
yeah , we do .
we have some exciting news for you .
your own dean , craig pelton ,
has been selected to join the board of
colorado community college &apos;s , and i &apos;ll just go , go ahead dean .
guys . talk .
okay . hello greendale .
as you know , this is something i wanted for a very long time and
i wanted to thank all of the people at greendale that helped me
achieve this and my partner , domingo .
very proud of my craig .
oh , that &apos;s , but , oh , oh .
and now let &apos;s open it up to some questions .
dean . dean . dean . as a gay dean .
what is your opinion about
the recent controversy surrounding
the cancelled pride parade , and do you think you were selected
to join the board because of your sexual preference ?
i would just like to say that we are very proud to have mr.pelton
on the board , whatever his lifestyle may be .
which happens to be gay !
which is great , but irrelevant !
hey , it gets better !
oh good .
we &apos;re so happy .
i feel like scum .
gay people are scum ?
hey , don &apos;t play that card with me young man .
i make gayness look like mormonism .
i don &apos;t like being this dishonest .
dean , i want to say thanks for doing this .
i never knew .
i mean , people talked , but , for sure ...
well , it really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with my work .
yeah , but it &apos;s helpful , to me .
you know , and to a lot of us , so .
thank you .
confine yourself to your role domingo .
and lose the attitude .

hare krishna .
krishna krishna .
oh , daniel @-@ san , you much @-@ a humor .
hm , okay .
let &apos;s stop there .
i &apos;m not gonna hit you .
and it &apos;s not because it &apos;s illegal ,
and it &apos;s certainly not because i &apos;m afraid you know karate
because there is nothing about your performance that is believable .
see , we only hit things , that effect us .
i don &apos;t hit water .
or old mayonnaise .
or the air after a fart has dissipated .
and i &apos;m not hitting you .
you are the worst actor i &apos;ve ever directed
and i &apos;ve directed both wahlbergs !
from the top !
danny does a bit with the floor sanders , miyagi is amused ,
and kenny gets me another god damned cup of coffee
with six splendas in it !
hare krishna .
he &apos;s so mean to chang .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
you could just drop out of the play .
well , you know i could .
or chang could .
i mean , the director is not being mean to me .
but you talked chang into auditioning
and then you got his part and now he &apos;s suffering .
you &apos;re right , i should threaten to quit .
or just quit .
well , if i threaten to quit maybe that will be enough
for him to stop abusing chang .
i was kind of born to act , brita .
when i do it .
i can feel it pleasing the universe .
that &apos;s dramatic .
see ?
theodore says that if they &apos;re sparrows they &apos;ll be flying
in less than 12 days . if they &apos;re albatrosses ,
we &apos;re in trouble .
albatrosses have a 270 day fledgling period .
thanks for guarding the nest with me .
this is what you do when you &apos;re working ?
must be nice .
all right , look .
there &apos;s a bird &apos;s nest in the router .
now if you want to fire me , fire me .
either way , until those birds are gone
nobody gets any closer .
well of course not .
if you move them the mother won &apos;t come back .
keep up the good work .
show me wax on .
this is the worst acting i &apos;ve ever seen in my life .
show me wax , off .
the ghost of your father just turned his back on you .
your ancestors are clawing their way
deeper into the earth to get away from you ,
you make me embarrassed to have thumbs ,
i can see air quotes around you .
show me paint the fence .
knock , knock , knock , anybody home ?
oh look , there &apos;s nobody here , oh it &apos;s so dusty ,
it &apos;s almost like nobody &apos;s been here in years .
there &apos;s a note .
never let me act .
mr. lundegaard , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i cannot stand by while you do this .
that &apos;s fine , you can go .
i &apos;m not bluffing .
you can &apos;t make an actor more talented by yelling at them .
and if you don &apos;t stop , your lead character is going to walk .
lead ?
you played danny larusso .
well i &apos;m the karate kid .
the karate kid is about kesuke miyagi ,
an immigrant who fought against his own people in world war ii ,
while his wife lost a child in an internment camp .
noriyuki morita was nominated for an academy award
for his performance .
ralph macchio ?
showed up .
i cast you because your measurements
allow me to use the same wardrobe as last year .
i cast ben because he has the sadness and
talent that could make this show great .
if i have to physically drill into his chest
and suck it out with a straw !
so you can take a flying kick and a rolling donut !
you &apos;e fired .
but i &apos;m talented , too , right ?
what ? no . really ?
really ?
oh my god ! you &apos;re like doing
a terrible vinnie barbarino up here .
约翰 · 特拉沃尔塔在其中饰演的学生角色
but , like , i know you &apos;re not capable of anything better .
so , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been so nice to you .
take care annie .
yikes , right ?
what a diva .
thanks for sticking up for me .
no problem ?
from now on , she &apos;s dead to us .
hey gay dean we got a problem here .
you ring the local papers .
you &apos;ve shut down the campus wifi
until a nest of baby birds can grow ?
that &apos;s a little too gay .
i didn &apos;t do it because i &apos;m gay .
wait , i &apos;m not gay .
oh . oh , that did not just get said to us .
you are gay .
you are openly gay and we love it .
but now we are dealing with more flak
from conservatives for appointing you
than we ever did from gays for not having one of you .
yeah , and the gays aren &apos;t coming to your side .
you know why ?
because the whole point is to get a job by being gay
and then to do as good of job as the normals .
that &apos;s what the gays want .
they don &apos;t want a gay dean who acts like a weird gay monster .
i &apos;m not a gay dean .
whoa , not cool , man
don &apos;t bring us into your web of lies .
well , now what do you want me to do ?
figure it out , gay dean .
figure it out .
hey , domingo .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
guys , the school needs wi @-@ fi ,
and my job is to run the school .
the school doesn &apos;t need baby birds .
the nest needs to be moved .
you are not crossing this line .
i &apos;m taping this .
this is on video .
guys .
this is two white security guards
versus one unarmed black man and two baby birds .
your move .
stand down .
stand down .
no security , no weapons .
just one unarmed black man
versus one unarmed , openly gay dean .
now move that nest , please .
just a hair back domingo , it &apos;s like you &apos;re breathing for me .
* your lifestyle is alternative *
* your influence is positive *
* you represent the changing of the tide *
* inspiring to young gay men *
* you &apos;ll never be ashamed again *
* but there &apos;s another secret locked inside *
* gay dean , gay dean *
* gay dean , gay dean *
* i &apos;m begging you to be a gay dean for the school board *
* gay dean , gay dean *
* gay dean , gay dean *
thank you so much .
i have called this press conference because
i have been less that honest with the public .
you know me as the openly gay dean of greendale community college ,
but that doesn &apos;t even begin to describe what i really am .
i belong to one of the most marginalized
and least openly honest groups in america .
i am a politician .
now what does that mean ?
are politicians like you ? well we look like you ,
but we will say and do whatever we have
to in order to acquire and keep our jobs .
it means
nothing i say and very few of the things i think can be trusted .
i am tired of being in this particular closet
so i am coming out now .
i only hope that you can accept
an openly political person on your board .
if not , i understand .
thank you .
just faster if get to my office this way .
we don &apos;t need any pictures of this .
i can &apos;t believe the dean got kicked off the school board
just for admitting he &apos;s political .
yeah .
some groups take longer than others to gain acceptance .
we like our politicians in the closest because we &apos;re afraid ,
deep down , we &apos;re all a little political .
any of you guys smell a bird murderer ?
i came here to apologize .
well , i hope your apology comes with a beak and hollow bones
and a special magnet in his head it uses to migrate .
you skipped wings .
insects have wings .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , abed .
i lost myself in a role .
it won &apos;t happen again .
two of them died . there &apos;s one left .
he &apos;s hanging on , but i &apos;m worried
he &apos;s turning into a symbol of my own innocence .
isn &apos;t chang &apos;s play tonight ?
if any of you go , you &apos;re supporting abuse .
oh , dial it back , annie .
well , i &apos;m definitely in .
it &apos;ll be interesting to see how his fake crying
is different from his real crying .
well i &apos;m a big fan of the performing arts ,
but i &apos;ll go to chang &apos;s play anyway .
karate kid adaptation ?
karate kid adaptation ?
karate kid adaptation ?
karate kid adaptation ?
karate kid adaptation ?
karate kid adaptation ? okay .
i might .
i &apos;m catching up .
directors have a saying .
actors are worthless , empty @-@ headed homunculi ,
but the right one , in the right role
can change the world .
hm , i have found the right one .
he &apos;s found the right role ,
and tonight , your world changes .
you &apos;re welcome .
he replaced me with annie kim .
sorry . you okay ?
you must be the new people in apartment 20 .
what was that ? karate ?
yeah , you know ?
hey , me and some of my friends are gonna have a party at the beach later .
you should come .
hey ! are you the repair man ?
aye .
faucet &apos;s really leaking there .
aye .
when are you gonna fix it ?
after .
after what ?
after , after .
come ask , leave boy alone to train .
you got a lot of nerve , old man .
but i like that . i like that .
name a place .
tournament .
sergeant miyagi .
yes , sir .
regret to inform wife , sir .
complication at birth , sir .
no doctor , it can &apos;t .
oh shit .
oh shit .
please forgive me .
no need fight anymore , you proved point .
what , that i could take a beating .
every time i see those guys ,
they &apos;ll know they got the best of me .
close eye .
get up , daniel .
get up !
you all right , russo ?
we did it , mister miyagi .
we did it .
i &apos;m speechless .
i forgot chang was up there .
me , too .
it &apos;s such a relief to be able to support him
out of something other than fear .
i guess all that suffering chang endured paid off .
it &apos;s not what the play suggests ,
but you have to wonder if it wouldn &apos;t have been better
for daniel to get beat up even more .
i am at a total loss about what lesson to learn from any of this .
maybe that &apos;s the lesson .
i lost a button .
maybe we all lost a button .
hey , hey guys !
thank you so much .
hey , thank you for making me do this .
you &apos;re welcome .
congratulations .
i &apos;m jealous .
no , no , don &apos;t be .
believe me , i sit in my dressing room
and all i dream about is a white picket fence and a dog .
i don &apos;t have those either .
chang , let &apos;s go .
i guess all the actors go to some sort of actor bar together .
so , i &apos;ll see you guys at school .
bye .
hey , i know this great bar for people that don &apos;t hate themselves .
what do you say ?
my lady .
my lord .
we are gathered here today
to celebrate the release of this bird into these skies .
that its now fully formed wings
may find purchase upon the four winds .
if anyone would like to say something , now &apos;s the time .
oh , i &apos;ll always remember
how you kept me from getting email for a week .
and that chirp you do when you want more bread .
yeah , that one .
and now everyone , please put on your cat masks and finger wings .
with these cat masks ,
we remind you that this place can no longer be your home ,
but with the fluttering of these wings ,
we symbolically join your flight into the natural world .
wings everyone .
okay . you can go now .
yeah . off you go .
time to go , little bird , that &apos;s just the way it is .
then it &apos;s done .
you did the right thing , abed .
thanks to you , that bird has his whole bird life ahead of him ,
to fly , meet lady birds , even start a bird family .
you made a difference .
abed .
did you get any of that ?
yahoo !
