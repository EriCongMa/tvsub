all right , clockwise , honey .
don &apos;t fight it .
let me make you .
what ... is that ?
this is the only thing us miller men know how to make .
and we call it the sauce .
it stinks .
it doesn &apos;t stink .
fawn is coming over for a midnight fondue supper .
there &apos;s no chocolate or cheese on this earth
that makes a cube of bread pop like the sauce .
your girlfriend &apos;s coming over for the first time ,
and you asked nick to cook ?
true , normally food alla nick would be less appealing to me
than licking the floor of a beach bathroom .
but i want fawn to have the best ,
and the sauce is the best .
good for you--
when you said &quot; fawn &quot; and then &quot; fondue , &quot;
i definitely thought you were headed in the direction of--
step 1 : fondue .
step 2 : do fawn .
that &apos;s not bad .
yeah , and i was like , &quot; fondue is fawn done . &quot;
th @-@ these are all good .
hey , has anybody heard from cece ?
&apos;cause she hasn &apos;t answered any of my texts ,
and i &apos;m starting to get worried .
jess is starting to find your behavior ...
&quot; suspicious . &quot;
that &apos;s a police word .
it &apos;s not a police word , winston .
it &apos;s a very common word .
# 施密特 # # 莫斯卡托 # # 莫斯卡托2016 #
and you know why i &apos;m keeping my distance .
i like schmidt .
for the second time !
i know how many times .
if you could see my face right now ,
i &apos;m smiling , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; ah . &quot;
and if jess finds out , she &apos;s gonna want to get involved ,
and i don &apos;t want her involved
because there &apos;s nothing that she can do .
look , if you act suspicious ,
then she &apos;s gonna be suspicious , all right ?
look , don &apos;t slink your head in the dumps .
you got to raise your hand with the sunshine
wh @-@ where people walk , you know ?
because that &apos;s what the whole point of the ...
when the ... if you can lead &apos; em to water ,
but you can &apos;t make a sound , right ?
look , just call her .
fine , okay , i &apos;ll call her .
but ... and listen to me ,
she cannot find out .
under no circumstance .
okay , baby .
look , your secret is safe with me .
that being said ,
i am not a smooth man .
yeah , i get that .
did i do something to piss cece off ?
oh , schmidt , you have something on your pants .
ah ! it &apos;s a spider !
jess , why did you do that ?
you know how he gets-- he turns into
a cartoon elephant of yesteryear
who just saw a mouse .
which is offensive in present day
&apos;cause it seems like a gay stereotype
they tried to sneak by us .
where &apos;s my balance ball ?
there &apos;s a mouse loose in the house . &quot;
where is it ? we &apos;ve got to hunt it down .
we got to have a spiderhunt .
we &apos;re not having one of those .
no , dude , no more spiderhunts .
guys , they &apos;re all over me !
this is childish , and you need to get over it .
jess , would you please ? you know this fear comes
from a very real place-- 1999 .
american pie was sweeping the nation .
and everybody was doing it with pies .
i just happened to accidentally fall asleep right afterwards .
and when i awoke ,
the dried apple filling was ...
it just had attracted so many spiders ,
and they were all over it , and i ...
okay , everyone was doing it with pies ?
well , y2k was an uncertain time .
i don &apos;t know &quot; everyone , &quot; jess .
i might have dabbled .
fawn can &apos;t see me like this .
fawn won &apos;t care .
jess , i &apos;m embarrassed ...
for her to see me in this state .
you &apos;re fine ...
it &apos;s embarrassing-- just a little spider !
you &apos;re fine .
and there it is ! i just saw it !
get off the table .
we &apos;ll do the spiderhunt .
fawn can &apos;t see you like this .
there it is !
it &apos;s right there-- it &apos;s licking it &apos;s lips .
so i &apos;m finally e @-@ mailing that girl , may .
nice .
here &apos;s what i got so far .
&quot; dear may .
lay down on me . &quot;
well , th @-@ then what ?
you met this woman weeks ago-- i can &apos;t believe
you haven &apos;t e @-@ mailed her . just text her .
if i had her number , i would text her .
she gave me her e @-@ mail .
and now i have to write how i feel .
which is weird , it &apos;s like ...
i @-@ i like her . much .
you like her much ?
all right .
&quot; girl , it &apos;s warm today .
&quot; yesterday was warm , too .
yeah . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m gonna write , &quot; yeah . &quot;
you &apos;re happy about this ?
damn it , no , it doesn &apos;t feel right .
yeah , just hold it down , hold it down .
okay , you guys know the drill .
we split up into teams , and we hunt this spider .
why can &apos;t we just call an exterminator ?
yes .
they &apos;ve all blocked schmidt &apos;s calls
since the dandelion incident .
it moved like a spider , nick !
i don &apos;t know a cece .
yeah , i do . how the hell are you ?
jess , please , hurry up , we &apos;re on a hunt !
it could be right above our heads right now .
hanging from its butt @-@ rope .
come over .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
did i do something ?
are we in another purse thing that i don &apos;t know about ?
no , no , jess , of course it &apos;s not you .
it would just be ...
an honor .
i &apos;ll be right there .
great , wear shoes that you don &apos;t mind getting spider guts on .
bye .
so ...
what &apos;s going on with cece ?
well , i had to beg her like a nerd ,
but she &apos;s finally coming over .
oh , she &apos;s coming over ?
yeah .
good , man .
took a lot of cajoling .
that &apos;s cool .
normally , it &apos;s like , she &apos;ll come over all the time .
but now it &apos;s diff ... i don &apos;t know why
that would be the case at all ,
but that &apos;s cool-- i respect the decision for her to come over .
why are you acting weird ?
i &apos;m acting weird ?
mm . do you know something ?
do ... ?
you ... i &apos;m not a smooth man .
is she mad at someone ?
ah ... no .
no .
no , she &apos;s not mad at anyone .
it &apos;s the opposite .
it &apos;s the opposite ?
that &apos;s not what i said .
you said , &quot; no , no , she &apos;s not mad at anyone .
it &apos;s the opposite . &quot;
i said , &quot; whoa , whoa .
&quot; cheese is bad e &apos;ryone .
let &apos;s stop and spit . &quot;
the opposite of mad is ...
does she like someone ?
what would make you assume that would be ... ?
i can hear it .
i can hear it building its house .
building its sticky , deadly house
that you can never leave .
building it .
with its ass .
we &apos;re breaking up into two @-@ person teams . cece .
each team has one smusher and one jar @-@ man .
nick , i &apos;m gonna make you a smusher since you have to stir .
hey , am i stirring right now ?
or is my arm still and the world is stirring ?
coach , you &apos;re a jar @-@ man .
you &apos;re with schmidt .
cece , with your delicate little hands , you &apos;re a born jar @-@ man .
okay . which means i need to pair you up with a smusher .
i smush . that &apos;d be me .
smusher for life .
you &apos;re such a jar @-@ man .
you don &apos;t even know you &apos;re a jar @-@ man , jar @-@ man .
yeah , you are . you &apos;re a born j @-@ man .
come on , winston .
uh , cece .
yeah .
before we get started , you want to have a quick
jar @-@ man strategy session ?
a little jar @-@ jar strat sesh ?
are you winking or farting ?
the only strategy is : find the spider , kill the spider ,
mount the spider &apos;s head on top of the roof
so all the other spiders know .
all right . and spiderhunt !
spiderhunt ! spiderhunt !
you find that thing ...
... you @-@ you make sure that it &apos;s done .
that &apos;s extreme . that &apos;s ...
okay .
hey , what do you think jess and cece are talking about ?
uh , probably that stupid movie theater popcorn machine
that cece wants me to get for the bar .
she keeps haranguing me about it .
&quot; popcorn machine , popcorn machine . &quot;
look , i don &apos;t know what void
cece &apos;s trying to fill in her life ...
i don &apos;t know , either . why would i know ?
i don &apos;t know what void she &apos;s trying to fill .
it &apos;s all she wants to talk about . oh .
stupid movie theater popcorn machine .
i &apos;m like , &quot; shut up , dude . &quot;
you put bologna in your bolognese ?
where else would it get its name ?
trick question-- it gets it from the mayonnaise .
yeah , yeah .
you got it .
do you think a good subject line is &quot; the inside of you &quot; ?
hey , you know , i bet i could spot this spider
a lot better if i was on your shoulders .
do not ask me again
to get on my shoulders .
that &apos;s a once @-@ a @-@ year thing ,
and you already used it on halloween ,
when we were ten @-@ foot @-@ tall ralph macchio .
ow ! damn it !
that was cool .
i didn &apos;t like that . i could feel
your genitals on the back of my neck
like an airplane pillow .
okay , you know what ? how about this ?
i &apos;m not sure why he did it
but i sure am glad that god rearranged
the letters in &quot; yam &quot; to ...
create something even sweeter .
what ?
may .
oh , may , yeah . yeah , all right .
keep going , keep going .
oh , dear god .
it &apos;s left the web to feed .
all right , i &apos;ll put that .
seems like a weird thing to say .
lots of bars have popcorn machines .
i really think that people would dig it .
they &apos;re not that expensive ,
and everybody loves fresh popcorn .
do you like somebody in the loft ?
winston .
okay , what did he tell you ?
he told me you like someone but he won &apos;t name names .
is it schmidt ? do you like schmidt again ?
no . no , no , no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
absolutely not . no .
who is it then ? who ?
i want to tell you . i want to tell you so ,
like , so badly-- you know me--
i want to tell you so bad , i just , um ,
i &apos;m very sorry , but i can &apos;t .
right , right , right , right , you can &apos;t tell anybody ,
except freaking winston !
that slow puzzler !
i know .
i &apos;m lower down on the food chain
than officer cat fancy ? !
no !
no . no , no , no , no . it &apos;s just i know
that you would do anything to help me ,
and in this situation ,
you know , there &apos;s just nothing to be done .
and we both know that
you would just want to get involved .
well , i can stay uninvolved .
i want to tell you , but i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
okay . that &apos;s fine . okay .
that &apos;s cool , that &apos;s cool . new teams !
you have to tell me who she likes .
there are no secrets between jar @-@ man and smusher .
please .
she &apos;s my best friend . you have to tell me .
okay .
look , jess ...
she likes me .
it &apos;s me she wants .
not even for a second .
i thought i was convincing .
yeah .
i need you to close your eyes and taste it .
okay .
oh , nick .
it &apos;s legit terrible .
well , you taste for texture not taste , you big old ...
not really what i was looking for at this stage .
definitely affects my confidence .
wait . wait !
the only person that cece could like that
she wouldn &apos;t want to tell me about ...
is nick .
does cece like nick ?
does cece like ... ?
oh , my ...
no ...
you guessed it .
how you did that ?
oh , my god . my ex @-@ boyfriend and my best friend ?
i feel like brenda when kelly dated dylan !
or the other way around .
now , i know those are the characters
from the original 90210 .
but that &apos;s about my ceiling . dylan-- was his nickname
the peach pit ? &apos; cause i remember ...
i remember that being a whole thing .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m a little wound up .
you should be wound up because the peach pit used
to be yours , but now brenda want a slice .
everybody trying to get a slice of that peach pit .
you have every right to be mad ,
jess , but just do it quietly .
you know , just do it on the low , do it in here .
30 seconds , and you haven &apos;t brought up the popcorn machine .
yeah , well , i guess i &apos;m just gonna have to drop it .
you know , even jess didn &apos;t want to hear about it ,
and she &apos;ll listen to schmidt discussing andy cohen
discussing bethenny discussing nene .
well , great , i &apos;m glad that &apos;s behind us .
yeah .
now let &apos;s never speak of popcorn machines again .
cece and nick ?
cece likes nick ?
cece likes nick ?
i mean , i guess i understand it
&apos;cause they &apos;re at the bar together ,
and once you start sharing tips ,
where does the sharing end ?
look ... jess , it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
because we all just cats and dogs at the end of the day .
what about schmidt ?
schmidt &apos;s nick &apos;s best friend ,
and schmidt and cece have a history .
look at the memory on you .
i &apos;m gonna have to help schmidt through this .
no , no , no , no , no .
look , jess , you can &apos;t talk to schmidt
about cece liking nick . come on .
no , you &apos;re right . i have to talk to cece first .
right , you got to talk to ce ...
no , wait , no . no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no . jess , you can &apos;t talk to cece
because cece , you know , and nick ,
they just won &apos;t work . &apos; cause i was talking to nick .
he said , &quot; winston . &quot;
i was like , &quot; what &apos;s up , nick ? &quot; he said ...
what ?
he said she ugly .
he said what ? !
he said she look like a dang ol &apos; meatball with hair .
new teams !
you know who &apos;s great ?
cece . one of our finest .
lovely woman .
and she has so much to offer .
is that what this is about ?
she sends you to sell me on it ?
no , nick . she doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m talking to you at all .
wait .
you guys have talked about it ?
all the time .
but i thought
she and i had come to a decision .
which is ?
it &apos;s not happening .
well , why not ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not interested .
and i know it &apos;s not cool to say , but ...
i don &apos;t like the way it would look .
people are gonna say what they &apos;re gonna say .
they &apos;re not reasons not to go through with it .
fine . you want to know my biggest concern ?
my biggest concern is the smell .
the smell ?
the smell of it .
yeah , and it &apos;s not cece &apos;s fault .
i mean , they all smell . i &apos;ve told her that .
you told cece you think all women ...
don &apos;t make this a feminist thing ...
it ... i &apos;m not making it a feminist thing .
how ? they smell terrible .
it &apos;s common knowledge .
i thought your biggest concern would be
how it affected the people around you .
i mean , sure , a bunch of old drunks will grab at it ...
but if your biggest concern is the smell ,
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s highly manageable .
yeah , i guess there &apos;s , like , special solvents and soaps .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t read up on it that much .
you know , but you got to really get in there and scrub it out .
it &apos;s disgusting .
you know , &apos; cause of the daily wear and tear and ... oil
and grease just cooking in there .
it &apos;s enough to make a man barf thinking about it .
i mean , they get really hot .
i know what temperature it gets .
but if i &apos;m being honest , you know--
and i haven &apos;t talked to her about this-- but ...
i do have good memories associated with the smell .
ball games , the circus , hanging with my dad .
listen here , you idiot . i &apos;ve known cece
a very long time , and i can promise you
the smell will not be a problem .
that &apos;s really easy for you to say
&apos;cause you &apos;re not the one who &apos;s gonna have
to remind her to clean it all the time .
i promise you ,
if it becomes a problem ,
i will remind her .
well , if you remind her and she doesn &apos;t do it ,
i don &apos;t want you sneaking around and cleaning it yourself .
nick .
i &apos;m a good friend , but i am not that good of a friend .
... &quot; that a dream house is a house ,
but a dreamboat is a person . &quot;
i mean , it does speak to the soul .
hey , what are these ? i &apos;ve always wondered .
those are grapes .
uh , they &apos;re our glass grapes , bro .
grapes ?
brings the whole , like , room together .
what the hell they doing in the loft ?
cece , um , do ladies have loins ?
you know , it &apos;s like i &apos;ve never looked around this house before .
skimboards , a boxing glove .
who in this loft has been to a single coachella ,
let alone six of them ?
don &apos;t tell cece that we talked .
she doesn &apos;t want me getting involved .
of course she does , she just didn &apos;t think
you were into the idea , okay ?
she really values your opinion .
what if you guys had a r ...
a r @-@ real talk ?
you know , outside of the bar .
all right .
we &apos;ll talk , just the two of us , outside the bar .
i &apos;m proud of you , nick .
just make sure she makes her case
about facts and figures .
and no more of this , &quot; come on , nick ,
it tastes so yummy &quot; crap .
new teams !
* i want to do something freaky to you ... *
no one can resist
