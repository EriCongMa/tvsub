第五季第六集
save greendale committee , please welcome
our newest member , math teacher ben chang .
okay , let &apos;s get serious .
i &apos;ve compiled a short list
of the most immediate greendale emergencies .
is deforestation on the list ?
i , for one , am glad that this is happening .
what this school needs is a band of heroes ,
champions willing to rise up
and &quot; get all those potatoes out of the gym . &quot;
we &apos;re like house vagadosh
in the hbo original series bloodlines of conquest .
ohh , yeah !
bloodlines of conquest .
that &apos;s my show right there .
that is a good show .
they really get the incest right .
what the hell is bloodlines of conquest ?
it &apos;s a medieval fantasy series .
it &apos;s based on these great books that nobody seems to read .
it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s got betrayal , boobs , espionage , dragons .
oh , wait , dragons ? is that a spoiler ?
i just started season one .
i don &apos;t start watching shows until they &apos;re so popular
that watching them is no longer a statement .
so because you &apos;re three seasons behind ,
we have to live in a fantasy world
where there &apos;s no such thing as dragons ?
do we also have to pretend that lord stevarios is still alive ?
oh !
thanks , abed .
how about i just buy all the bloodlines of conquest books ,
read ahead , and spoil the whole series for you ?
that &apos;s insane .
that &apos;s something an insane person would do .
knuckleheads , focus .
item one , the greendale student census is out of date .
britta , abed , why don &apos;t you partner up on that one ?
give you a chance to squash this beef .
next , the midterm dance is tonight .
who wants to be on the decorating committee ?
fine , i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;ll do it .
i will be on that committee .
me too .
are you guys volunteering because you think i &apos;ll do all the work ?
i wouldn &apos;t .
no . not at all .
i don &apos;t care enough to lie , so no .
i will reward that honesty
by giving you something easy .
a bulletin board fell down in the cafeteria a couple months ago .
think you can get it hung back up ?
i &apos;ll give it a drive @-@ by .
great .
we have now completed our first task ,
&quot; have a productive meeting ! &quot;
for every task that we complete ,
a star goes on the task wall !
oh , yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah !
brince ironstone &apos;s daughter is his mother !
brince ironstone &apos;s daughter is his mother !
hi there .
what can i do for you ?
can you get me a drill , a couple of screws ,
and a bulletin board ?
no , i cannot .
okay , i tried . bye .
you wanna hang a bulletin board ,
you need to get a work order from the head janitor .
they get more powerful than you ?
hello , i &apos;m taking the school census .
please fill out this form , but don &apos;t talk to me .
i can &apos;t hear .
are you deaf ? but you read lips ?
barbagarbagarba garbabarbabarba ?
that was gibberish . you &apos;re good .
i wish i knew sign language .
are you going to have another intense burst of compatibility
with a girl we never see again ?
i can &apos;t hear you .
the midterm dance will need a visual theme ,
like &quot; let &apos;s blow off steam , &quot; and it &apos;s trains .
i have an idea .
chang , your last idea was to murder .
edison . the bulletin board &apos;s a no @-@ go .
really ?
so you did your best , and this task just ...
eludes you ?
i have a lifetime of experience with red tape .
i know when to walk away .
yeah , you do .
hey , edison .
the system is lazy .
i have integrity , too much to deal with any of it .
i &apos;ll do it myself .
and i would love to watch you try .
okay . i am on bulletin board duty .
you guys are in charge of the dance .
oh , professor pushpin !
jerry , carlo , crazy schmidt . i &apos;m annie .
you learned our names .
i did .
crazy schmidt , how are c.j. &apos; s carinet lessons going ?
well , she &apos;s having a little trouble with his left finger lifts ,
but she &apos;s getting there .
annie , do you want that bulletin board hung up ?
let me put in a work order for you .
there you go .
that should happen in three to six business months .
any way we could bump that up a little ,
so it &apos;s somewhere above ...
&quot; lower flag for reagan &apos;s death ? &quot;
you gotta talk to a custodian for that , we &apos;re janitors .
there &apos;s a difference ?
we were just starting to like you .
had enough ?
i &apos;m just getting started .
what was your stumbling block , being nice ?
look , i admire your idealism ,
but my guess is that you will be crying uncle
before that board ever goes up .
game on , baby .
come on , come on , come on .
what ? god .
this isn &apos;t over !
here we go . you wanted to get dirty . this is where it starts .
deputy custodian lapari ,
annie edison from the save greendale committee ,
how &apos;s your daughter &apos;s soccer ...
i &apos;m sorry , this is a closed function .
we do not discuss business at custodial mixers .
but your daughter , soccer .
daughter , soccer . yes , thanks for coming .
hey , get a load of that wood burnt sign .
did mr. whitney in woodshop make that for you guys ?
yes , that is a whitney original .
oh ! you know , i noticed that whitney &apos;s bathroom
has this amazing toilet .
flushes like a dc @-@ 10 turbine .
probably exceeds code ,
but what &apos;s wrong with a little friendship between departments ?
now how can our committee be your friend ?
bob ?
excuse me .
chief custodian bob waite ,
buzzhickey , annie edison .
hickey and edison , something in the job queue ...
bulletin board .
yeah , we were hoping to get that up ...
let &apos;s take a walk .
that &apos;s quite a spread , bob . i &apos;m impressed .
well , it &apos;s election time .
if i don &apos;t break out the fancy sausages ,
my ass goes in the grinder next january .
keeping my people happy , it &apos;s an uphill battle .
for example , look at this .
a lot of the websites we try and visit
get blocked by this weird filter thing .
now let &apos;s say i wanted to move a work order
for a bulletin board
from the bottom of the queue to the top .
now how can i do that
when i &apos;m dealing with this ?
they want their porn unblocked .
then they &apos;ll give you your board .
that &apos;s what that was ? how did you know ?
did you investigate pornography when you were a cop ?
something like that .
so he wants a bribe .
welcome to the labyrinth , kid .
only there ain &apos;t no puppets or bisexual rock stars down here .
and at the center of it all , if you &apos;re lucky ,
a piece of cork and a few pins .
so what , is it worth it ?
is that what a bulletin board is to you , professor ?
a piece of cork ?
that &apos;s not what it is to people that lose their pets ,
people that need rides ,
people whose bad bands need bad bass players .
to them , every pushpin has the power to change the future .
so yes , professor , it &apos;s worth it .
i know a lady in the i.t. department .
okay , i &apos;ll put some food on the tables ,
we &apos;ll lower the lights ,
and that &apos;s a midterm dance .
i guess it could use a little something theme @-@ wise .
i have an idea .
&quot; bear down for midterms . &quot;
what ?
&quot; bear down for midterms . &quot;
you can &apos;t just repeat it . you need to explain yourself .
it &apos;s midterm time .
people have to bear down ,
study hard , get to work .
it &apos;s &quot; bear down for midterms . &quot;
is there a dot i &apos;m not connecting ?
it &apos;s a play on words .
&quot; bear down &quot; is an expression .
i know the expression , chang .
&quot; fly on the wall &quot; is an expression ,
but if i want to pitch &quot; fly on the wall for midterms , &quot;
you might ask , &quot; what do you mean ? &quot;
chang ? are you crying ?
i understand i &apos;ve been crazy in the past ,
but ... that doesn &apos;t make it any less frustrating
to be completely dismissed like this .
i don &apos;t know if you guys even see me as human anymore .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s like a joke to you .
are all asian men like a joke ? if it &apos;s like a racial thing .
no .
no ! no !
i &apos;ve paid for my crimes .
underneath all the craziness , i am still a human ,
and i ...
i do want to make a difference and ...
can you respect that ? please ?
chang ...
what can we do here ?
bear down for midterms .
okay .
okay , well ...
we &apos;ll ... put up some bear things ?
we &apos;ll bear down . for midterms .
okay .
you want me to lift web restrictions
solely for custodial ?
they need to have full access , so they can research , um ...
custodian stuff .
if the filter is mistakenly blocking a site ,
they just need to submit the url , and i can ...
okay , what do you want ?
excuse me ?
tell us what we can do for you so that you can do this for us .
oh . cool .
i ... i didn &apos;t know it could work that way .
i guess i could use decent parking .
right now they make me park in annex b.
like a ...
lunch lady .
our committee can talk to parking .
but , debra , let &apos;s be clear .
i want everything to get through that porn blocker .
what do you mean everything ?
everything !
understood .
i &apos;m very happy right now .
so just bears everywhere ?
yep .
and then we &apos;ll have some cakes , party hats ,
birthday stuff !
this is coming together better than i thought .
i &apos;m sorry , birthday stuff ?
yes , duncan .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
birthday stuff .
well , i &apos;ve been sad to see that bulletin board down
in the cafeteria for so long .
i &apos;ve always had a passion for bulletins .
if parking for the i.t. guy
puts that board back where it belongs ,
i won &apos;t stand in the way .
you know what you need ... speaking as a fan of bulletins ...
you need to have the dean appoint someone to oversee them ,
to make sure bulletins stay organized and protected .
i &apos;ll do it .
we could look into that .
well , not to be that guy , but , uh ...
you think you could look into that before i do this for you ?
you want to control all the bulletin boards in the school ... why ?
you might want to start talking turkey , waldron ,
because the macy &apos;s parade is almost over ,
and grandma &apos;s getting drunk .
do you know where my department &apos;s power
comes from , miss edison ?
parking spaces .
wrong .
there was plenty of space to park in dinosaur times ,
but not one single parking department .
my power comes from a scarcity of parking ,
just like your dad &apos;s comes from a lack of hugs .
and you know what takes my power away ?
carpools .
carpools organized through ride shares .
ride shares posted on bulletin boards ,
you can take the books off your head
because we &apos;re done posturing .
you want me to talk turkey , well , gobble gobble .
i want ride shares gone .
let &apos;s get out of here .
all right .
what ?
i &apos;ll talk to the dean .
i must say , i don &apos;t know what we did ,
but we sure did the hell out of it .
i guess the key to dance decoration is just pick an idea .
and then bear down . right , buddy ?
here are your sodas .
oh ... my god .
yeah , pretty great .
yeah . bear down , baby .
too soon , you guys . this is way too soon .
too soon for wha ...
too soon for this !
after this morning in wisconsin ?
bear breaks loose at a kid &apos;s birthday party ,
mauls a whole bunch of people ?
why am i explaining this
when this is obviously a ghoulish reference to it ?
the news has been covering it all morning !
that &apos;s where i got the idea .
you know how sometimes you hear something
and forget you heard it ,
but you think you came up with ...
oh , man . this is bad .
we &apos;re in crisis mode now .
we really messed up , you guys .
an office of bulletin board oversight .
ah , what a novel idea .
i &apos;m gonna fill out this form right away .
but first , a toast .
to hanging a bulletin board :
easy peasy , lemon squeezy .
uh , first time toasting ? get in here , buddy .
easy peasy , lemon squeezy .
i &apos;m not saying that .
i hate to be that guy ,
but i &apos;m not signing this form
until professor hickey says &quot; easy peasy , lemon squeezy . &quot;
damn it , annie . don &apos;t do this .
whatever you &apos;ve got in your butt ,
can we get it out later ?
when , after he signs it ? after it &apos;s all too late ?
annie ?
you petty old man .
when we started this ,
i thought you &apos;d get a taste of the system and spit it out ,
not open a bottling plant .
you &apos;re just like all the people that ...
what ? the people that put you here ?
the people in the big machine that made you fail ?
you went from being a cop
to teaching criminology because of the system , right ?
unfortunately for greendale ,
you have to prove it by getting nothing done .
well , here &apos;s a bulletin for you :
&quot; annie edison doesn &apos;t get nothing done . &quot;
and where should i put that bulletin , edison ,
on a sham piece of cork controlled by a parking guy
that lights his cigars on student ride shares ?
my god , annie .
what kind of labyrinth have you created ?
certainly not the magic kind with puppets and macho rock stars .
you whored yourself out , kid .
you wanted that board so bad
that you made every board on campus worthless ,
and in doing so made the school just a shade dirtier .
i thought better of you , young lady .
oh , man . this got sorkin @-@ y .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t think anything in particular of you ,
and now i see why !
okay , i didn &apos;t follow most of that ,
but it feels like i ought to do this .
oh , hey , annie .
um ... what do you think ?
&quot; fat dog for midterms &quot; ?
yeah !
pretty cool .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s an expression .
&quot; fat dog for midterm . &quot;
like , don &apos;t sweat it , fat dog it .
hang out , relax , like a fat dog .
you can look it up on wikipedia .
there &apos;s an entry in there .
yep .
i never ... uh ... okay .
i just ... i feel like i &apos;m missing ...
you know , annie , um ...
sometimes it feels like you don &apos;t take us seriously .
yeah , i guess we bring it on ourselves ,
but it &apos;s still pretty frustrating .
annie , is this a race thing ?
race !
no ! god , no !
you guys !
i accept that it &apos;s an expression ,
but i don &apos;t see the connection to ...
you &apos;re overthinking , annie . it &apos;s decorating .
just pick an idea and bear down on it .
really poor choice of words , ben ... too soon .
but you guys are right .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve had a really hard day .
i need to just ...
fat dog this concept .
fat dog !
fat dog it , baby !
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry , abed ,
but to the spoiler goes the victory .
but i really liked her .
she probably likes you too , but she also likes cash .
i &apos;m devastated .
now i feel bad . but ...
you learned a lesson ,
and i gave a differently abled person a job .
oh , no , now i really feel bad . wait , no . come back !
let &apos;s be fat dogs about this .
hello . what happened to you ?
nothing . you never called .
i &apos;m sorry .
that was the year of the gas leak ,
but i won &apos;t use that as an excuse .
i can be inconsiderate and a lot of other things .
me too .
i guess i could &apos;ve put in some effort .
would you like to go to lunch sometime ?
no , i &apos;d like to go to dinner . now .
i can do that .
i started this coat check without permission anyway .
excuse me , excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
excuse me !
all right , all right ! enough !
let &apos;s go .
thanks .
thanks .
let &apos;s do it again !
