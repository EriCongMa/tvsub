And now all I feel is worried
about everything, including my marriage.
So you can't go on the tour.
But I want to go to idyllwild, if I can get in.
I'm withdrawing my suit for custody.
We can adopt you right away.
We kissed. And now we're like...
More than friends?
Wyatt, please don't tell me
you're acting like this because we broke up.
What the hell do you care?
You should be with your family, Ana.
So should your child.
I think Ana wants to keep the baby.
But I think the only reason she isn't is because of you.
Have you thought about keeping the baby?
I think you should.
Are you okay?
Oh, I think the baby is coming.
One recorded fatality.
Requesting medical back up.
Officer Adams Foster, I'm right near there,
I'm on my way.
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
Just a bad dream.
Yeah?
Go back to sleep.
I miss Jesus.
I miss him too.
You think it's too early to call him?
No.
He might think it's too early,
But I don't.
Hi, love. How are you?
How's flintwood treating you?
Let me talk to him.
Hold on.
Okay, hold on, hold on. Mama wants to say hi.
Really, woman?
Hey, bubba. So how's the first week been?
Mama's talking to your brother.
Hey, Jesus,
Where are those headphones that you borrowed before you left?
Well, you're gonna have to mail them back.
Are you serious? You get a padded envelope
and then you just write our address on it.
You do know our address, right?
And then you stamp it and then you just drop it in the mail.
God, I seriously wonder how you even function sometimes.
Mariana, be nice.
What? He took my good headphones.
I think you'll survive.
Morning.
Hey, are you excited about the first day?
Uh, yeah, if I ever get there.
I just looked online and there's a freaking traffic jam on the 5.
I wish I didn't have to commute.
Well, we wish you had told us you wanted to go
before the dorms got full. Can't have everything.
Brandon, did you get the oil checked
in the car, like we asked you to yesterday?
Yes, it's fine.
Okay, drive safe.
Promise.
We're so proud of you,
playing piano again.
Playing piano at the best music school in the country.
Okay, okay, I gotta go, or I'm gonna be late.
Okay, drive safe.
Yes, you said that.
We can't live in fear, okay?
Oh, first day of summer school.
Who's excited?
I am.
Okay, look, I have to go.
I have to get to Ana's.
She's not great, but she's getting better.
Look, I really have to go, Jesus.
I keep forgetting to tell you
that your independent study at the drop-in center
has been approved by the teacher board.
Oh, good.
So just think,
you get that done, you pass history
and you will be all caught up
and you can graduate on time, with your class.
It's almost like I'm a normal teenager.
Normal is overrated.
You know what I mean.
Yes, so now you just have to decide...
What to write my paper on, I know.
Hey, look, Callie wants to talk to you.
Talk to him.
Hey, dude. How's it going?
Okay, I have to get to Victor and Elena's.
I love you guys.
Love you too.
Awesome. Yeah.
You think we made a mistake, letting her play nursemaid and all?
I don't think we really had a choice.
Mariana let me in. You ready?
Yeah. We're gonna go
talk to the man who owns the truck.
Okay, well, didn't the detectives do that already?
Yeah, but we just...
Stef, can I talk to you for a second?
How's that going?
Oh, yeah?
Do you really think you should be investigating this?
I mean, you're awfully close to it, you know?
Do you not want to catch this guy, honey.
You know, this person that pulled a hit-and-run
on our kids? They could have died.
Of course I want him caught, honey,
But that's not what I'm talking about.
Do you not understand
why people run from the scene of an accident?
It's because they're high or they're drunk
or they are wanted for another crime already.
This could happen to someone else,
Another family. Is that okay with you?
No, of course it's not okay.
Okay, well, it's been three weeks since this has happened
and we've got nothing.
The case is gonna be closed if something doesn't break soon.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mike.
Yeah.
Nice.
不要喝咖啡了 喝点茶
Yeah, sure.
You have to come back for my adoption.
I don't know. A few weeks. Maybe, like, a month.
Promise?
Okay. All right, bye.
That is, without a doubt,
the longest conversation we've ever had.
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm meeting Connor before class.
Oh, hey, have you and Connor decided
what you're gonna do at school?
Are you gonna tell people or...
Um, I don't know.
We haven't really talked about it.
Well, don't you think you should, bub-- talk about it?
You know, whatever you decide, we've got your back, right?
I don't know. What do you think?
I mean, I already told my dad.
And he's, like, the scariest person for me, so...
I don't think we should.
Really?
Why not?
It's just
it's nobody's business, you know?
Brother man, brother man, you got some change?
Got a nice jacket.
Excuse me, miss, you got some change?
You got any change?
No.
Okay, princess, thanks.
I'm sorry to bother you. You go on back to your privileged life.
You don't know me, okay? You don't know anything about me.
Oh, you want to bet?
Yeah.
Hey, get out of here. You, leave that girl alone.
Don't you talk to me like--
I'll get up on you.
I ain't doing nothing, man. This is a free country.
I don't even know why we have weather people in San Diego.
Maybe you could become one of those,
when you're better.
I mean, how hard could it be?
I'll get her.
Hi, girl. Hungry?
Do you want to try breastfeeding her?
Oh, no, there's no point, not with the brace.
I can't get her in the right position.
I pumped earlier. It's in the fridge.
Okay.
You're okay to stay today?
Hi, sweet girl.
Sure you don't want to go see that boyfriend of yours?
Didn't you say he was leaving soon?
Oh, yeah.
He's going on tour with his band.
But it's fine.
And your moms, they're okay with this,
with you spending all your time here?
Oh, yeah. They're totally fine.
And they're not mad?
About what?
That I kept Isabella.
No.
Not at all.
They're happy for you, I promise.
There you go, beautiful.
Good morning.
Hey, so I've got a few projects I could use your help with.
We need to repaint the chairs from outside,
the metal ones. Would you mind?
Yeah.
Okay, great.
I picked up some spray paint on my way in.
We just gotta make sure we lock up the storage cabinet before we go home.
Lock it up? Why?
Kids steal it. They huff with it,
or sell it to gangs.
Looks like I left it in my car. I'll be right back.
Have you got computers in here?
The center is for foster kids.
I am a foster kid.
Okay.
Well, what's your name?
A.J.
Okay, A.J.,
well, the computers are over here.
Is there the registration?
Yeah.
I'm Brandon.
Ekaterina.
Ekater...
Just call me Kat.
Okay.
So what are you...?
Piano performance.
Oh, yeah? Me too.
Name and discipline?
Brandon Foster, piano.
Sorry.
You said Brandon Foster?
Yes.
Oh, wait. Here you are.
But you're not a pianist. You're here as a composer.
Oh, you're a composer too, huh?
I'm Tony.
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
I'm definitely, like, a pianist.
Maybe there's someone I could...
Miss Sanderson, hi. Miss Sanderson.
Oh, Teri, please. Hi, Brandon.
Excuse me, I think there's been a mix-up.
They've got me listed as a composer and I'm a pianist.
Oh, did you not read your acceptance letter?
I'm pretty sure it was clear.
I may have seen the word "Congratulations"
and started running around the house.
To be honest, I didn't think your technique was
where it needed to be for the performance track.
But I did hear something in that piece you wrote,
something really special.
This is a wonderful program.
I hope you'll give it a chance.
I couldn't have noticed that you didn't metion
that the truck had been stolen till the day after the accident.
Why was that exactly?
I already told the cops all this.
Well, you didn't tell these cops.
I used to park it behind the garage
'cause it didn't have the tags
or the registration or...
Right.
Yeah, but the key was in the vehicle when it crashed.
I used to leave the keys up behind the visor.
I never expected anybody to steal a piece of junk like that.
I didn't even know it was gone till my son said something.
Oh, you have a son?
Oh, I don't recall seeing that mentioned
in the reports. Does he live here?
Oh, no.
He stays with some buddies over on cliff.
That's why I didn't say anything about him.
Well, if you could give us any kind of contact information
you have for him, we'd really appreciate it.
What's his name?
Thought you might be hungry.
Thank you.
So you work here?
Yeah, just part of my privileged life,
along with seven foster homes and juvie, you know.
I'm sorry.
What's that?
Oh, it's stupid.
I don't think it is. I like it.
Let me see.
Who is that?
It's... it's dumb.
It's this guy that me and my brother made up
when we got put into the system and sent to different homes.
He was like our own private superhero, you know?
Yeah, me and my brother could have used someone like that.
We'd...
We'd put the symbol in the windows of our bedrooms,
and that meant we were supposed to meet at Belmont Park.
Like the bat signal?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where is your brother now?
Okay, well, if you need anything, just let me know.
What?
You're so good at that, Callie.
You're so good
with the kids who come in here,
getting them to open up. It's pretty amazing.
Now I really hope
that when this independent study of yours is over,
that you'll keep working here.
You've got a real gift.
Who is that?
Uh, it's me actually.
I wrote it for my audition.
Oh, really?
It's lovely.
You think so?
'cause I, you know... I... I thought I was coming here as a pianist
and they put me in the composing track.
So I don't know what I want to do now.
Really?
That's not a demotion, you know.
Composers are the real rock stars around here.
I mean, think about it.
Nobody remembers the guy who played Mozart
in front of the king,
but everybody knows Mozart.
So the stage will be set up here,
the refreshments here, where we can keep a good eye on them.
And over here will be the
sort of hangout area. Does that sound good?
Perfect. Great work.
And day one of summer school?
Off without a hitch, as far as I can tell.
It's great that we were able to hire those extra teachers.
Thank you, Kilfer Grant.
Speaking of the Kilfer Grant,
one of the benefits that comes with it is a trip for two
to D.C. for their national conference.
And it's coming up, like, early july, I think.
I hear it's incredible. The most amazing
progressive thinkers in the business are all there.
So can you come?
Okay.
When are things gonna stop being weird between us?
I don't even know
what that little kiss was about.
I'm straight.
I was married.
It was nothing. Right?
Yes, absolutely.
Okay, good.
So can we just go back to how things were?
Yes.
And you'll think about the trip?
I'm telling you, we'll have a great time.
I promise.
So, as you know,
composers are paired with a musician for their magnum opus--
the piece that you'll be working on together all summer long.
The big news is, this year,
the piece deemed best by the faculty
will be performed with the Los Angeles philharmonic
at Disney Hall.
Oh my god, I hope I get Kat.
She's, hands down, the best one here.
Okay, so here we go.
Mischa, you're working with Andre.
Tony, you'll be with Jin.
And, Brandon, you'll be working with...
wait, no. Yes.
Right, you'll be working with Kat.
Yes, kat.
I'm sorry,
I'm one of the most accomplished musicians here.
There's no way you're pairing me with him. He's brand new.
I'm s... I... I thought
you liked my piece. You said it was lovely.
Yeah, I was being nice. Sure, it's lovely,
for a six-year-old. You're not ready for this.
I've been coming to this
camp every summer for the last five years.
And I'm certainly not gonna lose my chance of playing disney hall
because I got partnered with some amateur.
Brandon, please forgive Kat.
She's very passionate about her work.
And I'm sorry, Kat, but
these partnerships aren't up for discussion.
I, for one, am very excited
about what you and Brandon come up with together.
But...
End of conversation.
Kieran, you'll be working with Reese.
Christian and Kay, and Timothy...
Okay, so your dad's coming to pick you up, right?
Do you want me to wait?
No, I'm good.
Okay, I'll call you.
Hey, what are you guys...?
Daria signed us up to decorate for the party tomorrow.
Can you just tell me one thing?
Why? Why would you break up with me?
I don't get it.
You know what? Just forget it, okay?
Why don't you just tell her?
Tell her what?
That you're into Jude. It's completely obvious.
I... I just...
I can't.
Hey. Come in.
Is that a baby book?
Is there something you want to tell me?
No, it's for Isabella.
Figured.
I mean, it would be kind of hard for you to be, you know...
Because we haven't, you know...
So are you avoiding me?
I mean, is that why you're spending all your time with the baby?
No.
Not really.
I mean, I have to do something all summer too, right?
And you're gonna be gone.
And Ana really needs the help, so...
And that's why I've barely seen you at all in the last week?
You're coming to the party tomorrow at school, right?
Yeah, if I can.
Mariana, it's the start of the tour.
Look, I'll be there as
soon as Elena gets home from the bakery, okay?
Okay.
What am I gonna do without these lips for three whole weeks?
I have no idea.
Don't forget I'm only here till noon today.
Oh, yeah. That's right. Why is that again?
Well, I decided that I'm doing
everything in my power this summer
to act like a normal teenager,
so I'm going to the stupid anchor beach end-of-the-year party thing.
Oh, yeah? Where are they having it?
On the beach, like, right in front of the school.
Wow, nice.
We never had any parties like that where I went.
They were like, "School's over. Get out of here."
Yeah, I know. I still can't believe I go to school--
Callie, everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
Hey. Hey, A.J., wait up.
Look, you can't sleep in there, okay?
But if you ran away from your foster home,
or if you need anything, I can help you, okay?
I won't get you in trouble, I promise.
Hey, sorry I'm so late. The bus never came.
I ended up having to steal Jude's bike.
Elena, you can get going! I'm here!
She left already.
I went to the doctor yesterday
and he told me I could take off my brace.
Said I need to take it easy,
but I can start doing normal things again,
for a few hours.
Well, do you need me to take her?
She probably needs to be changed.
Nope, just changed her.
Well, you should probably lift her head a little bit.
Her neck is...
Do you need any help?
Okay, well.
Be careful. I don't want you to hurt yourself.
You know what? I'm fine.
I've got this. Thank you.
Sorry.
Listen, I really appreciate you coming all this time,
but I think I need to spend some time alone with Bella, okay?
Okay.
Don't you have a school party today?
Go.
You know, go see that boyfriend before he leaves.
Give him a reason to miss you.
It's my dad's truck, okay?
I don't know what you think I got to do with it.
Why would I steal it? I got my own car.
And a suspended driver's license.
Maybe you just didn't feel like driving your own car that day.
Look, what do you want me to say? I didn't take the truck.
I haven't driven that thing in, I don't know, a few years.
Okay.
You don't mind hanging out for a few minutes?
Thank you.
You see that cut above his eye?
Looks to be about three weeks old to me, and totally consistent
with someone who might have hit their head on a steering wheel.
I checked his prints.
And?
They don't match the ones on the steering wheel.
You're kidding.
There's no way it could be him.
Okay.
Also they're sending the cars to the junkyard,
so if you need anything out of the Volvo,
this is your last chance.
I quit my coding class,
and I gave up my whole summer for her and the baby,
and now it's like she doesn't even want me around.
I'd be willing to bet that's not entirely true.
Well, you would lose that bet.
And stupid Mat is leaving.
Probably gonna forget
all about me and hook up with all those groupies.
You think someone's little sister has groupies?
He is not gonna forget about you.
Well, I'm gonna make sure of that.
I'm gonna have sex with him.
Wait, you're gonna lose your virginity?
Are you sure you're ready for that?
Shouldn't you be at Idyllwild?
Yeah, I didn't go today.
Couldn't miss the party, right?
I'm not really sure it's for me.
What? Really?
They put me in as...
Wait, Brandon, sorry. I'll be right back.
Sorry I crashed your party.
How did you even know I was here?
You and that guy were talking about it this morning.
I didn't know where else to go, so...
What happened?
I was looking for a place to sleep tonight, you know,
someplace safe, and a couple guys jumped me.
You...
You said you could help me.
Yeah. Yes, I will.
But I can't really do that
unless I know exactly what's going on.
I ran away from my foster family.
They was pretty cool and all, but I ran away
'cause I was supposed to meet up with my brother.
He aged out a couple of years ago,
so he's been on his own.
But we were supposed to take off and get out of town.
We had this whole plan, but when I was supposed to meet him,
he never showed up.
Okay, what if we called your foster parents?
They always told me, "you run one time,
That's it. We're done."
Okay, so if you can't go back,
we can get you emergency placement.
But where are you gonna sleep tonight?
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.
Okay.
Ok, wait, wait. So you two are gay for each other?
Yeah. So what? You got something to say about it?
No, man. It's all good.
I just heard and I thought--
You thought what?
Nothing, man. It's cool.
Then get out of my face.
I knew it wasn't me.
Shut up, Daria.
I thought we weren't gonna say anything.
Don't be mad at Connor.
It wasn't him. It was me.
What?
Well, I thought I was helping.
I thought you were the one who didn't want to come out,
so I figured nobody was gonna care.
I'm sorry.
It's not like anyone cares if you're gay.
I'm not gay, okay?
Wait, Jude. Jude.
Do you like the new stuff...
The new songs, I mean?
I do like the new stuff.
But I like other stuff too.
Oh, yeah?
And I was thinking
maybe we should do some other stuff tonight.
I mean, you're leaving soon and...
On the beach?
Why not? It's romantic.
It's kind of public.
Not up here.
It's your last night.
Yeah, I know,
but, Mariana, I don't want to do it.
I mean, I want to do it,
but not like this.
It's our first time, and...
We gotta get on the road.
We've got a midnight show in L.A..
I'm sorry.
I should probably get back, help load up the van.
Okay. I think I'm just gonna...
Okay, well,
I'll see you in a few weeks.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.
Okay.
Nice set.
I mean, the new guy you got
could use a little finesse.
It's kind of like watching a bear play keyboard, but--
We can't all be classical pianists, you know.
Right. No kidding.
Turns out, I'm not one either.
They made me a composer at Idyllwild.
I'm not even there to play.
Is that, Is that a bad thing?
I mean, it's not what I wanted.
Okay, sure,
but you're a great composer, Brandon.
You love writing songs.
Why are you acting like this is
some kind of epic fail or something?
'Cause the kids there are totally out of my league.
Is this what happens
when everything just comes naturally to you...
you just give up the minute something gets hard?
Besides, I'm sure you're better than you think.
You guys aren't even playing my songs.
Out of respect, Brandon. They aren't ours to play.
Well, I think you should,
play them, I mean.
If I'm gonna be a composer,
I'd better get used to other people playing my songs,
even bear paws over there.
What are you doing here?
Well, you know how to throw a party, huh?
Well, I was lonely.
Stefanie Marie Adams Foster,
you haven't had a night alone in that house
for the last 10 years.
I don't for one second buy that you got lonely.
What is it?
I'm a mess.
I'm trying to hold it together.
I'm trying to, I'm trying to find out
who the hell did this and...
They told, they said someone was dead.
They said there were reported fatalities.
And when I walked up and I saw the Volvo,
it was crushed like a beer can.
I thought...
I thought we lost them.
I thought my babies were gone.
And I thought I'd never be okay, ever again.
I just wanted to see you. I just wanted to see you.
My love.
My sweet, sweet love.
It's all gonna be okay.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I go to school here, remember?
Why aren't you back at the...
Not really in the mood.
Yeah, me neither. Do you want a beer?
Oops, I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
It's good for the kids to see that you're a human being.
Not some education reform monster?
Yes, exactly.
Speaking of education reform,
I...
I can't go to the conference.
Really? Oh, no.
Are you sure?
I am.
I, I have just
too much going on at home right now
for me to even consider planning a trip away. So...
I hope you understand.
Of course.
Of course I do.
You'd better leave the lights off.
Right. Smart.
Please don't, like, mess with anything.
I won't, I promise.
Thank you.
I should, I should thank you.
It probably sounds dumb,
But I have to write
this paper for my independent study
And I had no idea what to do.
But now I think I'm gonna do it
on what happens to kids when they're separated in the system,
Like you and your brother.
Glad I could help.
Okay, well, I'll be back first thing in the morning
to open up, so...
'night.
'night.
So you don't miss her?
Your mom?
I do sometimes, but...
Out of sight, out of mind, you know?
Okay, how do you do that?
How do you get your hair to fall like that?
It's softer than mine.
What do you do?
Do you use some special conditioner or something?
No, it just comes out of my head like this.
It's just so pretty.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I look it all over for you.
You know, you could have made it a little easier on me, all right?
I am on crutches.
So I don't...
I don't get it.
What do you mean, you're not gay?
Do you not like me?
No, of course I like you.
Do you not like me like that?
No, I do. I just...
My whole life I've always been labeled as something...
"The new kid," or "the foster kid,"
or "the kid with the dead mom." And I'm sick of it.
I mean, why can't I just be Jude?
I just want to be Jude for a while.
Does that mean you don't want to be my boyfriend?
No.
Okay.
Okay, good. 'cause I thought...
No, I promise.
Another bad dream?
No, just thinking.
Everything okay?
Absolutely.
You know, I was doing a little thinking myself.
I know you're gonna say no,
But I think that we should
plan a little trip, just you and me.
We could really use a getaway.
I think it's a terrific idea.
Really?
Well, wherever shall we go?
The Greek isles?
Capri?
I think Catalina is a little more our budget.
I like Catalina.
I do too, as long as you're there.
Are you sure we can afford it?
We'll make sure it's a priority.
Deal?
Yeah.
What? What are you looking at?
Oh, I think our bathroom is leaking again.
I thought the plumber took care of that.
He did.
Be careful.
Just hold on.
What...
Oh my god!
So much for getting away.
It is kind of shaped like Catalina.
So?
Did you, you know?
Mariana, come on, I have to go.
Can you just tell me?
Did you have sex last night or not?
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Okay, I want to hear all about it,
but I have to get to the center.
But I will talk to you tonight, okay?
What are you doing here? I thought you quit.
I'm not going anywhere, except for Disney Hall.
Oh, and you might want to start working on your quadruple trills.
The new piece I'm working on has got a bunch of 'em.
See you in class.
Oh, and for the record,
I'm sure you're used to pitching your fits
and getting what you want.
But I'm the oldest of five kids.
I've seen every kind of tantrum ever thrown.
I don't scare easy.
A.J.
A.J.
Hey, what are you doing here so early?
What happened to the spray paint?
Callie, what's wrong?
I did something really dumb.
I... I let someone
sleep here last night.
Damn it, Callie.
Why?
Why would you do that?
It's such a bad judgment call.
You know, I don't even know what to say.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah,
I'm sure you are.
I need this, Rafael, to graduate.
You should have thought of that before you did it.
You're fired, Callie.
Go home.
