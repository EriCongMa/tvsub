hey , jane .
oh , it &apos;s okay , baby .
wake up , baby .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
body temp is low .
he &apos;s been sitting here for a while .
that &apos;s today &apos;s paper .
what , was he reading the stock pages ,
he slit his own throat ?
there &apos;s something very odd about the edges of the wound .
well , yeah , the whole thing &apos;s odd .
i mean , there &apos;s no blood . there &apos;s no sign of struggle .
what ? death by a sharp nap ?
and the darkening of the nasojugal fold
indicates fatigue and vitamin deficiencies .
really ?
you .
you have dark circles under your eyes .
are you not sleeping again ?
thank you . you look nice , too .
morning , partner .
what do you got ?
james stern .
james stern ? why -- why -- why do i know that name ?
james stern ?
you know , i do , too . i think he was a missing person ?
i &apos;ll run him .
okay .
you having nightmares again ?
yeah , i dreamed i showed up to work in my underwear .
anxiety .
you think ?
yes , i have this reoccurring dream
that i have this biochemistry final ,
and i haven &apos;t studied .
really ? stop .
it &apos;s terrifying .
i can &apos;t take any more .
you &apos;re right .
james stern and his wife , emily , vanished two years ago .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
there was a history of domestic violence ,
and he was the number @-@ one suspect in her disappearance .
theory was he murdered her , hid her body , and fled .
that &apos;s right .
well , it looks like karma finally caught up to him .
sanskrit word .
you know , the cycle of cause and effect .
i think it originated in the shramana tradition .
do you have to do that ?
do what ?
that -- that word thing you do .
etymology ?
you can &apos;t stop , can you ?
not really .
hey , janie ?
yeah ?
you busy later ?
what , you mean after my relaxing day in the park ?
no . what do you got ?
i need to talk to you about mom and dad .
okay , yeah . sure , frankie .
i &apos;ll see you later .
maura , i &apos;ll see you at the autopsy .
i think mom is saving up to leave dad .
because she &apos;s selling anti @-@ aging lychee potion ?
come on .
she &apos;s got a job . have you ever seen her work ?
frankie , come on . she works all the time .
out of the home ?
janie , she got her hair highlighted .
this is serious .
she &apos;s a person . she &apos;s allowed to have her life .
without dad ?
god , i hope not , but that &apos;s up to her .
i mean , come on .
why don &apos;t you focus on your own life for a while ?
maybe it &apos;s time you learn how to cook .
hey , i can cook .
burnt toast and boiled water doesn &apos;t count .
i do more than toast and boiled water .
can i get you guys anything else ?
oh , so many things .
i would love a long vacation , for starters .
how &apos; bout you ?
new car , maybe ?
how did you guess ?
uh , american . mustang would be good .
i love that .
i grew up in detroit ,
and my dad worked an assembly line .
really ? well , our dad &apos;s a plumber .
good figure .
um ... i &apos;m -- i &apos;m frankie .
uh , this is my sister , janie .
i &apos;m lola .
nice to meet you , lola .
yes , i would love some more coffee .
thank you .
what ?
hey , doc .
guy &apos;s not exactly husband of the year .
beat the crap out of her .
put her in the hospital a couple times .
cold heart .
no kidding .
no , his -- his actual heart . it &apos;s frozen .
so is his right lung .
what does that mean ?
he wasn &apos;t killed recently . he was in cold storage .
so he &apos;s been in the freezer .
or possibly a meat locker .
i &apos;ve stored bodies for months .
unidentified bodies in 10 degrees
without a sign of decomposition .
however , you still get freezer burn and discoloration ,
like his toes .
how long has he been dead ?
well , how long has he been missing ?
two years .
it &apos;s possible .
oh , god .
doc , what &apos;s this ?
adhesive residue .
from what ?
duct tape . his wrists were taped together .
blanched indentations --
his mouth was also taped .
did the killer use a scalpel ?
i have to find jane .
the body was frozen within hours of the murder ,
left undisturbed for two years ,
then thawed enough to be able to move his limbs ,
to redress him in a suit , and pose him on that park bench .
it &apos;s hoyt .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s doing this from behind bars .
he killed james stern and emily .
if -- if -- if they &apos;ve been missing two years ,
he killed them , what ?
what , six months before he came after me the second time ?
and then somebody stored the body for him
and then just , you know ...
dumped it right in front of my face .
i haven &apos;t had enough time
to confirm that this is hoyt &apos;s work .
it &apos;s him . it &apos;s him , maura .
i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything because , you know ,
personally , i thought somebody was screwing with me .
this was left in front of my building last night .
a flare ?
oh , jane .
i &apos;m gonna call frost . okay ?
we &apos;re gonna get patrol officers out here ,
and you are gonna get some sleep .
yeah , well , not until the cavalry gets here , okay ?
i &apos;ll stay .
what are you gonna do --
hit him over his head with your birkin bag ?
w-- come on .
give me that .
no , it &apos;s loaded .
i &apos;ll stay up .
it &apos;s loaded . no .
magazine capacity -- 15 .
trigger pull -- 2.5 kilograms .
line of sight -- 153 millimeters .
right--
have you ever shot one ?
um ...
... no .
no . no .
but i &apos;m a fast learner .
okay .
it &apos;s empty .
okay .
point it .
um , wrap your left hand like this .
okay , now , push and pull .
loosen up . there you go .
push and pull with the same amount of force .
okay ?
okay .
good ?
yeah .
you look good .
okay .
okay .
you &apos;re laughing at me .
so ... okay .
okay . it &apos;s loaded .
okay .
i &apos;m only doing this because i &apos;m tired .
okay . point it that way .
good .
all right , now , don &apos;t shoot my neighbors
&apos;cause i &apos;d hate to have to lock you up .
jane ?
yeah ?
do i look bad @-@ ass ?
yeah , you look like a bad @-@ ass .
okay , good .
the sterns disappeared from their apartment in charlestown .
you checked every jane doe in the last two years ?
maybe we found emily stern and we didn &apos;t know it .
no . no , there &apos;s nothing .
her body is still out there .
if we could just find it ,
there could be some kind of a clue .
it &apos;s me . put your gun down , frost .
shh . jane &apos;s finally sleeping .
what , are you having a private little strategy meeting here ?
did you think i wouldn &apos;t find out about hoyt ?
whoa , don &apos;t come on in here , crack of dawn , yelling at me .
i was gonna call you .
oh , like hell you were !
inside voices !
hoyt &apos;s my case .
jane was my partner .
she was your partner !
shh !
who the hell do you think you are ? !
i &apos;m her partner now !
oh , yeah ? !
shut up !
her life is in danger again
from a deranged , serial @-@ killer sociopath
who &apos;s -- who &apos;s calling the shots from inside of a prison ,
and the two of you are comparing the size of your pe--
hey , hey ! whoa !
doc , hey .
okay .
shake on it .
what , you heard me .
shake !
that &apos;s better .
now we can all go back to work .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s very distracting to work in a wrinkled dress .
so go home and change .
no , no , i @-@ i &apos;m not leaving you .
but i have some bad news .
oh , and the day started off so promising .
the crime lab didn &apos;t find anything on the flare --
no dna , no prints .
well , i &apos;m not surprised .
i mean , why would hoyt make it easy on us ?
so much more fun to terrify the snot out of me .
jane ?
what are you doing here ?
looking for you .
you &apos;re back because hoyt &apos;s back .
i &apos;m back to make sure you &apos;re okay .
can i , uh ...
... buy you a cup of coffee ?
uh , uh , yeah .
yeah .
so , how you doing ? you okay ?
no .
but , you know , that &apos;s what hoyt wants .
well , we have the entire boston bureau working this case .
i appreciate the fbi &apos;s help .
you know , he &apos;s got someone working with him again
on the outside .
well , he is in solitary ,
but all it takes is an hour on the prison yard
to pass something or get something .
been listening to his calls ,
tracking communication ,
but so far , nothing .
you &apos;re not gonna find anything .
he &apos;s smart enough to get rid of it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i should ask you how you &apos;ve been .
good .
busy .
two missions in afghanistan .
wow .
it &apos;s good to see you .
wish it wasn &apos;t because of hoyt .
well , it sucks
that all we have in common is a serial killer .
so far .
you have really lousy timing .
thanks .
you look ...
god , you look great .
gee , thanks .
my beauty regimen is quite simple .
i just stay up all night ...
keep hoyt from slitting my throat .
it &apos;s working for you .
nice .
it &apos;s maura .
you want to come to the autopsy ?
that sounds lovely .
can that be our first date ?
yeah , that &apos;s actually an offer i &apos;ve never had before .
well , we never did have dinner .
yeah , i don &apos;t usually eat at autopsies ,
so , you know , maybe after .
i &apos;m gonna hold you to that .
come on . this will be romantic .
hoyt didn &apos;t know his victims ,
but there &apos;s something very personal
about the way he chooses to kill .
transecting a carotid artery
means that a healthy male like this
could take up to six minutes to bleed out .
in front of his wife , emily .
it &apos;s the ultimate way to control .
kill somebody you love in front of you .
and he -- he always went after couples , until me .
you were probably his biggest challenge .
that &apos;s why he deviated .
he wants to create the most extreme level of fear
that a human being can feel .
yeah , and he &apos;s darn good at doing it , too , isn &apos;t he ?
i hate that son of a bitch .
i really wish you would &apos;ve killed him .
wish i had .
hoyt thinks he &apos;s in control .
uh , isn &apos;t he ?
no .
we show him that we &apos;re in control ,
we take what little control he thinks he has away .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to that bastard .
no , you &apos;re not .
what &quot; no &quot; ?
what , now you &apos;re gonna tell me how to run my cases ?
i am .
in my office , detective .
come on . i know charles hoyt better than anybody .
i know his psyche . i know his m.o.
you are not the lead investigator on this .
you sit on your hands . you hear me ?
i caught him , okay ? twice , i caught him .
that &apos;s the problem .
we &apos;re about to go to trial
for four cases of first @-@ degree murder .
that son of a bitch killed nine people that we know of .
he stabbed your old partner ,
and he tried to kill you twice already !
yeah , which is exactly why i &apos;m staying on the case !
don &apos;t interrupt me !
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not .
hoyt made you a victim .
you &apos;re not a cop right now , and you better face that .
here we are again , jane .
going on a little field trip , hoyt .
i smell lavender and fear .
hello , mr. hoyt .
dr. isles .
you must be very proud of yourself .
that &apos;s a play i didn &apos;t see .
yeah . that was the idea .
and agent dean .
what brings you here ?
the same thing that brings me ?
jane .
mr. hoyt ...
i usually ask people to address me as &quot; doctor . &quot;
i nearly completed medical school .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re so precise
when you sever the carotid arteries of your victims .
well , i &apos;ve always been quite deft with a scalpel .
where is emily stern &apos;s body ?
hold him down in that chair .
are you gonna show me your technique ?
50 / 50 cotton @-@ polyester @-@ blend fabric
shows every wrinkle after a lot of use .
i thought i saw something .
i can &apos;t .
cavanaugh ordered me to keep you out of it .
come on ! this is torture not being able to help , vince .
i won &apos;t do anything . i promise , okay ? please .
it was my fault . i should &apos;ve been there .
you didn &apos;t know , and i shouldn &apos;t have gone alone .
you went alone because i made it hard to ask .
it &apos;s on me .
don &apos;t you dare say that , all right ?
you saved my life .
so , why aren &apos;t we partners anymore ?
because you saw me like that .
so what ? ! it didn &apos;t change anything !
yes , it does .
how could you possibly think that i have your back ?
how could you go into a dangerous situation with me
as your partner after seeing me like this --
this -- this broken ? it &apos;s ...
now , you ...
you listen to me .
he didn &apos;t break you .
no one can break jane rizzoli unless you let &apos; em .
it &apos;s a choice .
i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s for your research .
you assume correctly .
facial action coding system .
do you think you &apos;re gonna dissect my facial expressions ?
ah , yes .
where is emily stern ?
oh , not far .
you know , she cried when i slit her husband &apos;s throat .
but why now ?
why have whomever is working for you
pull james stern &apos;s body out of cold storage now ?
what &apos;s this ?
anger .
and this ?
empathy .
something you don &apos;t feel .
i can mimic ... any emotion , doctor .
pretty good , huh ?
will you tell me where emily stern &apos;s body is ?
no .
but it &apos;s not far .
will you tell me if you plan to hurt jane ?
oh , i do .
i plan to kill her .
psychically kill her ...
and -- and keep her alive until ...
i get out of here and finish her with my hands .
i want to feel her blood covering my hands .
i do .
you &apos;ll never get out of here .
oh , yes , i will .
but don &apos;t worry , doctor .
i &apos;m not gonna kill you .
no .
rape you !
maybe .
but kill you ? no .
you &apos;re clearly trying to frighten me .
i am .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
i know .
because you &apos;re like me .
why &apos;d cavanaugh agree to let us move hoyt here ?
convinced him it was safer for jane
if we moved hoyt into our lockdown .
federal prison &apos;s too porous .
can &apos;t even keep out dope and weapons .
hell , hoyt was able to get a picture of jane .
jane &apos;s gonna want to talk to hoyt .
i can &apos;t stop her .
and neither can you .
don &apos;t you even think about talking to cavanaugh .
why &apos;d she request a new one ?
you mean why are you her partner now and not me ?
i wish i knew .
what happened down there ?
i &apos;m not gonna move you . you &apos;re all right .
it hurts ! it hurts ! it hurts !
i &apos;m sorry , man .
i had no idea .
i try not to think about it .
oh , yes , i will .
but don &apos;t worry , doctor .
i won &apos;t kill you .
rape you !
this is the face of violence , anger .
who knew ?
what &apos;s interesting is that his primitive brain still telegraphs
the appropriate emotions to his facial muscles ,
which is why this threw me .
will you tell me if you plan to hurt jane ?
oh , i do .
i plan to kill her .
psychically kill her
and keep her alive until
i get out of here and i can finish her with my hands .
see , if he was fabricating this ,
i &apos;d expect to see asymmetry in his face .
which means what ?
he &apos;s telling the truth .
he &apos;s not planning to harm you right now .
oh , no , well , why would i think that ?
with the stalker photos
and the dead guy pulled out of the freezer after two years ?
we know this because his facial expression isn &apos;t crooked ?
jane ...
she &apos;s trying to help .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m being a jerk .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
because you &apos;re like me .
hey , um , can you go ask frost and korsak
if they &apos;ve got anything yet ?
sure .
thanks .
you okay ?
come on , maura , talk to me .
he &apos;s a freak . okay ? he gets to everybody .
i did a ...
i did a lot of research into his -- his background ,
his childhood .
maybe he &apos;s not wrong .
what are you talking about ?
maybe i am a little bit like him .
you are nothing like him .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know , jane .
i ... i was a weird kid .
were you killing small animals ?
no , but i dissected a lot of frogs .
no , that &apos;s different .
i just -- i started to think about ...
things that i never --
i never really thought about before .
here it comes .
there are bodies buried in your basement .
i spent a lot of time alone .
you know , i was -- i was adopted ,
and my -- my father was a professor ,
and my mother , she -- she came from a wealthy family .
i was an only child .
i just realized something when i was reading about hoyt
that i ... it just never occurred to me before .
there was a lot of benign neglect .
it &apos;s not that they didn &apos;t love me .
it &apos;s just that i didn &apos;t ask for much .
i don &apos;t think i really knew how .
and the less that i would ask for ,
the less time that they had for me .
they were just very ...
very involved in their ... in their own lives
and into each other and ...
they sent me to boarding school when i was 10 .
i actually think that i sent away for the brochure myself ,
which ...
they were delighted .
oh , i just ...
i was really lost .
come here .
no matter what happened to you ,
you are nothing like that monster .
okay ?
yeah , you were a little antisocial maybe ,
a little goofy .
but ...
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not the same thing .
okay ?
man , we &apos;re a pair .
thank you .
hey , jane ?
we got two units assigned to your apartment at all times .
friends of mine have volunteered .
okay . tell them i said thanks .
sure .
maura , what is frankie &apos;s face doing ?
movement of the outer orbicularis oculi pars lateralis .
he &apos;s happy .
what ?
i &apos;m being hunted by a serial killer ,
and my little brother &apos;s occipital spatula is orbiting .
i &apos;m sorry , jane .
oh , don &apos;t be sorry .
frankie &apos;s got a girlfriend .
we just met ! come on .
look , there it is !
his occipital spatula -- look , again !
well , you &apos;d be happy , too ,
if you found someone who could cook .
she made me dinner last night .
32 % of divorces are the result
of inequality in domestic chores .
oh . maura , come on . they just met .
hey , what if i came over and made you dinner tomorrow night ?
uh , no , thank you . you can &apos;t cook .
what if i brought lola ?
that &apos;s fast .
oh , come on , jane . i think you should let him .
yeah , let me .
let me do something nice for you . come on .
you &apos;re all hovering . okay , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . no .
actually , that &apos;s a common reaction to fear
as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex activates .
a lot of people find neurobiology fascinating .
are they all neurobiologists ?
okay , fine .
come make grilled @-@ cheese sandwiches
with your new girlfriend .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
yet .
all right . all right .
bye . i love you .
i love you .
look , maura , his gluteus maximus is beaming !
oh , enough with that !
what &apos;d you get ?
look . she &apos;s cute .
mm @-@ hmm .
my mother &apos;s gonna hate her .
it &apos;s definitely mold spores .
all right . well , that &apos;s something .
all it tells me is that
the photo paper was stored in a moist , dark space .
like a basement .
can you isolate what kind of mold it is ,
where it might be from ?
looks like ... stachybotrys chartarum .
it &apos;s a toxigenic mold .
is it rare in boston ?
well , it &apos;s not common .
requires a moist environment -- maybe a --
a flood @-@ damaged building ?
flood damage ?
can i use this ?
of course .
there was a class @-@ action lawsuit in dorchester --
five families all living in flood @-@ damaged houses .
they all sued the city when their kids got sick
from that same mold you just found .
see this neighborhood ?
all five families lived right there .
you said five ,
but there are six single @-@ family buildings .
the sixth house is vacant .
or occupied by the same person who took jane &apos;s picture
and disposed of james stern &apos;s body .
what do you want to bet
this is where james stern spent the last two years ?
must be a hell of a utility bill .
gives a whole new meaning to &quot; darkroom . &quot;
hey , korsak ...
&quot; to jane . &quot;
&quot; from charles hoyt . &quot;
please .
please help me .
i can &apos;t take any more .
this is recent .
this is the same paper that was on james stern &apos;s lap .
please .
emily stern is alive .
where is she ?
where &apos;s emily ?
jane .
not far .
y @-@ you seem very frustrated .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here , are you , on this case ?
might jeopardize your ability
to convict me of all those murders .
oh , you &apos;re gonna die in prison . that &apos;s enough for me .
oh .
well , can i go back to my quaint , little cell , then ?
yeah . just as soon as we find your friend .
and until then ,
we &apos;re gonna keep you here so you two can &apos;t communicate .
it &apos;s too late , jane .
shut up .
i &apos;d show you my hands .
we match .
i should &apos;ve killed you .
but you didn &apos;t .
now , isn &apos;t that interesting ?
why didn &apos;t you , jane ? why not ?
it &apos;s not because you didn &apos;t want to sink to my level .
nah . that &apos;s not it .
i &apos;ve been wondering the same thing .
why didn &apos;t i kill you ?
i know why .
all those women that you tortured and killed .
why ? w @-@ what made you go after them ?
bad luck ?
was that with me , too ? huh ? was it my bad luck ? !
is that why you came after me ? !
jane .
no , i @-@ i want to know !
i want to know .
you get to a point where you &apos;re not afraid anymore .
i &apos;m not afraid of you anymore .
i want to know ! why did you come after me ? !
i love you when you &apos;re angry .
i &apos;m gonna love you when you &apos;re dead .
why you ?
every good boxer fights a worthy opponent ,
or the -- the win is meaningless .
and you , jane ...
are the only worthy opponent that i have ever had .
get this animal back to his cage .
please help me .
i remember this research from columbia university .
using a series of algorithms ,
you can do corneal imaging .
see , the cornea is a like a mirrored bowl .
well , the resolution isn &apos;t great .
jane &apos;s right . you are one impressive chick .
it &apos;s not much .
yes , it is .
it &apos;s a basement in the back bay .
how did you know that ?
emily &apos;s looking at a hollow sidewalk .
i can &apos;t believe i know something you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s a vault ceiling . see the bricks ?
there &apos;s a sidewalk built directly on top of it .
when boston used coal ,
carts dumped it right from the street
through openings in the sidewalk .
so , emily stern is in a coal cellar .
yeah , and the only ones left are in the back bay .
help !
please ! i &apos;m down here !
can you hear me ? i &apos;m here !
help me , please !
help me !
help ! please , i &apos;m down here !
that son of a bitch .
can you hear me ? i &apos;m -- i &apos;m down here .
lola .
frankie brought her up . he -- he said it was okay .
yeah .
yeah , yeah , no -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s fine .
are you okay ? i was making you dinner , and --
i forgot , and it &apos;s --
it &apos;s been a long , bad day .
do you want me to go ?
n @-@ no . you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna -- i &apos;m gonna leave work at work .
you should go .
okay , just , uh -- just patrol outside , all right ?
okay .
um ...
where &apos;s frankie ?
he went to grab some beers .
oh , fantastic .
what are you making ?
i think it needs a little more salt .
let me see .
oh , that &apos;s delicious !
i really like to cook .
you know , it doesn &apos;t work out with you and frankie ,
you can still come here and cook anytime .
i &apos;m gonna go change .
okay . uh , dinner will be ready soon .
okay . thank you . okay .
frankie .
sit down .
where &apos;s jane ?
went home .
frankie &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s cooking dinner .
what &apos;s up ?
i want to show you this .
look at this .
isn &apos;t this strange ?
looks like cheek and chin work .
had her nose done .
and the only thing you can &apos;t change
is the space between your eyes .
she had plastic surgery .
put these on .
do it .
he killed your husband , didn &apos;t he , emily ?
it &apos;s not the kind of relationship
someone like you could understand .
i want you two to be able to say goodbye .
why would a kidnap victim living in the basement like a p.o.w.
get her face worked on ?
she ... didn &apos;t want to be recognized ?
frost , can you scan this ?
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
getting it .
okay , got it .
all right . now let &apos;s compare these three .
it &apos;s the same woman .
oh , my god . jane .
she thinks that she &apos;s in control .
she is .
no . we have to make her believe that she &apos;s not .
shut up , both of you .
he doesn &apos;t love you .
he did ...
enough to get him here .
i mean hoyt .
he loves me .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
he wants you dead .
that &apos;s not what he told you to do , is it , emily ?
he told you not to kill me , didn &apos;t he ?
emily &apos;s dead .
and you will be , too .
hoyt wants me alive .
and he wants that because he wants me all to himself .
don &apos;t you get it ?
hoyt doesn &apos;t love you .
he used you to get to me .
you &apos;re gonna watch your brother die now .
emily , wait ! stop !
frankie ! frankie ! stop !
shoot her !
you okay ?
