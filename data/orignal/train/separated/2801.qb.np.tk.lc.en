these are my old work pants .
sergio valente .
power saw kind of got away from me there .
the one with frank jr .

you &apos;re sweet to wait with me .
actually , gunther sent me . you &apos;re not allowed to have cups out here .
does anyone else think david copperfield &apos;s cute ?
no . but he told me he thinks you &apos;re a fox .
all right . janice likes him .
in fact , she likes him so much , she put him on her &quot; freebie &quot; list .
her what ?
we have a deal where we each pick five celebrities we could sleep with ...
... and the other one can &apos;t get mad .
the heart of every healthy relationship :
honesty , respect and sex with celebrities .
so who &apos;s on your list ?
ikim basinger ...
... cindy crawford , halle berry ...
... yasmine bleeth ...
... and jessica rabbit .
you do realize that she is a cartoon , and way out of your league ?
i know . i just wonder if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head .
annie esposito would never have dumped me had we had a list like this .
and also , of course , if her sister was famous .
who would yours be ?
first , i need a boyfriend . then i can have a list .
it &apos;s just a game , mon .

... daniel day @-@ lewis , sting and parker stevenson .
spiderman ?
hardy boy .
peter parker .

this is everybody .
this is ross .
how are you ?
chandler , joey

oh , yeah . we &apos;re gonna connect and bond and everything .
i thought we could go down to times square and pick up some ninja stars .
my friend , larry , he wants me to take a picture of a hooker .
we really don &apos;t take advantage of living in the city .
oh , sorry . did i get you ?
no , you didn &apos;t &quot; get &quot; me !
it &apos;s an electric drill !
you &quot; get &quot; me , you kill me !
calm down ! do you want this unit or not ?

where you heading in those pants ? 1982 ?
i saw down at the hardware store , they got those designer tiles on sale ...
... if you wanna redo your bathroom floor .
what &apos;s wrong with my bathroom floor ?
nothing . it &apos;s just old and dingy , that &apos;s all .
i highly doubt that .
if you move your hamper ...
... you see how the tile used to be .
i can &apos;t live like this ! what are we gonna do ?
relax . here , hold this .
this old stuff comes right up . i &apos;ll show you .
a little more than i wanted to see .
look at that ! every inch of this is glued down !
it &apos;d take forever to pry this up . you should just leave it .
i can &apos;t leave it ! you gouged a hole in my dingy floor !
there . there you go .
yeah , that &apos;s nice .
we can put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon !
give me a new floor !
l can &apos;t . chandler will kill me if l don &apos;t finish the unit .
l &apos;ll pay you double what he &apos;s paying you .
he &apos;s not paying me anything .
triple .
what ? i know what i wanted to ask you . can you roll your tongue ?
because i can and my mom couldn &apos;t .
and i figured that was something i got from our dad .
well , wait , you mean like this ?
yeah , you can do it too . yeah .
you &apos;re not doing it .
oh , right . okay . yeah , my mom could and i can &apos;t .
we don &apos;t have that .

all right . who you got it narrowed down to ?
elizabeth hurley .
very attractive .
forgiving .
susan sarandon .
you know what ? she &apos;s too political .
she &apos;d probably make you donate four cans of food first .
and lsabella rossellini .
very hot . very sexy .
but she &apos;s too international . she &apos;s never gonna be around .
so ?
so you gotta play the odds .
pick somebody who &apos;s gonna be in the country all the time .
yeah . because that &apos;s why you won &apos;t get lsabella rossellini . geography .
okay . so by &quot; melting &quot; you meant melting .
so is it , like , art ?
yeah , you can melt art .
hey , can i use your phone ?
sure . you want to call your mom ?

just in case .
oh , excellent !
what kind of karate is that ?
no kind .
he just makes it up .
how &apos;s it going with you guys ?
so far it kind of blows .
i don &apos;t know , i just thought he &apos;d feel more like a brother .
like you and ross . close and connected and ....
we &apos;re close now . you wouldn &apos;t believe the years ...
... of noogies , and wedgies , and flying wedgies , and atomic wedgies and ....
that &apos;s when the waistband goes over your head .
we drove each other crazy playing the shadow game .

i mean ...
... i don &apos;t know .
whatever . it &apos;s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyway .
oh , wait .
no , you &apos;re right . no , it was perfect .
i can &apos;t believe i screwed it up so bad .
you thought it was perfect ?
well , no , maybe it wasn &apos;t perfect ...
... but you know , it was pretty cool , you know ?
because we had all those great talks , you know ?
which ones in particular were great for you ?
well , you know , about the tongue thing , you know ?
and how i told you about my likes and my dislikes .
how i like to melt stuff , and how i dislike stuff that doesn &apos;t melt .
right . okay .
i feel like i can really talk to you because you &apos;re my sister , you know ?
yeah . i guess i do .
and then i go feel your friend up and make you mad at me .
well , i wasn &apos;t hopping mad , you know ?
you hopped a little bit .
yeah , i &apos;m really sorry . you know , i &apos;m really ....
okay .
well , this is my favorite part of the weekend . right now . this .

we found ninja stars . i almost get my arm broken by a hooker
she &apos;s not a hooker .
when i tell my friends about her , she will be .
phoebe , what &apos;s that ?
frank jr. gave me this before he left.a present .
lt used to belong to our dad.his garage @-@ door opener .
until frank melted it .
cool !
sound the bell , gather up all the men you can find .
we got ourselves an entertainment unit raising .
no , seriously , can you help us ?
on 3 !
1,2
why don &apos;t we just go on 2 ?
why 2 ?
because it &apos;s faster .
i could &apos;ve counted to 3 four times without all the &quot; 2 &quot; talk .
all right , but in the future
heavy thing ! not getting lighter !
1,2
so we are going with two ?
a good job , joe .
wow .
it &apos;s big .
so big it actually makes our doors look smaller .
maybe my ruler &apos;s wrong .
maybe all the rulers are wrong .
it &apos;s not that bad . so it blocks a little of your door , a little of mine .
i got a better idea .
how about it blocks none of my door , and a lot of your door ?
listen , before i forget , that side is still wet .
arm hair stuck !
let me just see if i &apos;ve got this right .
so this is a half @-@ caf , double @-@ tall , easy hazelnut ...
... nonfat , no foam , with whip , extra @-@ hot latte , right ?
okay . great .
you freak .
isabella rossellini
thank you .
a coffee to go , please .
isabella rossellini !
are you serious ? oh , my god !
damn ! i cannot believe i took her off my list !
why ? because otherwise you &apos;d go for it ?
yeah , maybe .
you lie .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;d go up to her ?
it took you 10 years to finally admit you liked me .
yeah ? well , missy , you better be glad that list is laminated .
you know what , honey ? you go ahead . we &apos;ll call her an alternate .
hold my cruller .
are you really gonna let him do this ?
he &apos;s about to go hit on lsabella rossellini .

i was wondering if i could maybe buy you a cup of coffee .
or reimburse you for that one .
aren &apos;t you with that girl over there ?
well , yeah , kind of .
but that &apos;s okay . we have an understanding .
