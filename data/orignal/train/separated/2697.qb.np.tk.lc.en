ton , will you get that ?
hello .
tony , it &apos;s me .
don &apos; t hang up .
you know who could answer this phone ?
please . you &apos;re so conceited . do you think i want to call you ?
you &apos;re drinking and dialing . i can smell the stoli .
yell to your sister , not to me . my poor cousin ...
... has not had her prosthetic leg .
what do you want me to do ?
tony , please .
i miss you so much . can &apos;t you come over here ?
don &apos;t you ever call here again .
didn &apos;t you see my favorite patient ?
tomorrow .
how &apos;s that going ?
let &apos;s not , richard .
i wish you hadn &apos;t taken him back .
i took you back .
i see the synergy . treat him ,
we start seeing each other .
richard , richard .
no , seriously .
if you want to know , he had a breakthrough last week .
what ? through somebody &apos;s jaw ?
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m wasting my time .
better i boycott with the italian american foundation ...
... and save the world from what is it this week ? gangster ?
the idea abc would think of producing that stereotypical goombah fest .
richard , we are an advertisement for the american experiment . we did great .
i &apos;m fed up with people assuming i &apos;m a thug because my name ends in a vowel .
undershirts , yelling . hollywood gives sociopaths ...
... the tragic grandeur of al pacino .
he &apos;s an expert at this . the guy &apos;s conning you .
condescend to me , richard . it gets me so hot .
tell me about this breakthrough . you said he &apos;s alexithymic .
nothing will get through .
not if it threatens that straw house he &apos;s built inside his head .
it concerns me you don &apos;t see this . pink @-@ slip this guy . he &apos;s dangerous .
i &apos;ll pink @-@ slip you if you don &apos;t do the chicken .
is that new ?
looks good .
did you bring your log ?
my log ?
remember ? you were to keep a record .
i asked you to write feelings ...
... of anxiety or memories of past anxiety attacks .
my parents and the pork store . i know .
that was ...
it was interesting .
have you thought at all about that ?
how do people find the time ?
to get well ?
look , my mother &apos;s dead . i haven &apos;t had a panic attack since .
you &apos;ve gone without them before . the conflicts that cause them ...
... and your depression are buried deep inside you .
are you happy ?
am i happy ?
that &apos;s not even ...
look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t bring the list .
i &apos;ll bring it next week .
will you ever think about bringing your wife into this ?
in here ? carmela ?
you &apos;re the one who wanted to take a proactive approach .
that &apos;s not in the future .
let &apos;s talk frankly . you demanded more of me . fine .
but you &apos;re not trying .
i know .
the past .
but shit happens in my daily life that needs attention now .
i got some genuine concerns , you know .
about my son . he shies away from anything that requires effort ...
... and i think he picks that up from me .
he &apos;s in football now . carmela &apos;s as guilty about this as i am .
she indulges him .
richard was right .
i &apos;ve been charmed by a sociopath . why didn &apos;t i listen ?
why do you think ?
why did i reject richard in the first place ?
if you think about my life , it &apos;s so textbook .
marry a man 10 years my senior .
of course richard &apos;s gonna be protective and patriarchal .
then i reject him for being just that .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with wanting to be safe .
i know richard &apos;s right . i should get tony soprano ...
shit .
i always thought it was that other guy . little augie aprile .
i can &apos;t believe i revealed his name .
why did you ?
does richard know who he is ?
i think he saw it in my day @-@ timer . that &apos;s why he &apos;s been so adamant .
because soprano is very high up .
if he was some button man you wouldn &apos;t treat him ?
please , with the terminology .
you know psychotherapy is limited in the treatment of anxiety disorder .
you &apos;ve medicated soprano and helped him gain insight he &apos;s able to absorb .
it &apos;s time to send him on to a behaviorist .
janice !
janice .
i was cleaning up .
when did you change the locks ?
the minute that ukrainian dye @-@ job was out the door .
don &apos;t mess with the russians , janice .
she can have her leg when she returns ma &apos;s record collection .
you would &apos;ve done the same thing .
i &apos;m getting calls from her cousin .
miss carburetor works of 1987 ?
don &apos;t fuck with me on this . give back the leg .
tony , those records are yours too . it &apos;s sad that you don &apos;t care .
those old albums ... they &apos;re a window into ma &apos;s soul .
in fact , i &apos;m making a documentary .
world war ii generation &apos;s music , exemplified by ma .
who are you kidding ? you &apos;re gonna sell them on the internet !
i have work to do .
cleaning the cellar .
good luck finding gold . you &apos;d make money working a real job .
like the minute i &apos;m out you won &apos;t have contractors tearing apart the walls .
oh , janice .

you got a girlfriend ?
you know who &apos;s turning into a little mink , though ? meadow soprano .
look at him perk up .
i &apos;ve known her since we were kids .
speaking of them ...

i wanted to fly to south beach . mom wouldn &apos;t pay .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m won &apos;t tell her .
look , kid ...
i &apos;m trying real hard here .
i know it &apos;s tough on you .
i &apos;m the guy that &apos;s dating your mom .
dating ?
don &apos;t get fucking filthy about it .
anyway this ...
this was a good idea she had , us going out to dinner .
not that one conversation solves anybody &apos;s problems .
i &apos;m only here so i don &apos;t have to hear her bitching and crying .
the gym , huh ?
mind if i make a stop first ?
my brother is out . he said you knew .
i get the bad @-@ tempered one .
bashir said that this payment would be late ...
... because we had truck problems .
three of them needed new hydraulics .
nobody talked to me .
he said you approved .
you &apos;re collecting on my routes . you gotta pay me .
only because you say they are .
you wanna question new jersey business practice that goes back 70 years ?
what is this , ralphie ?
i ought to stick a shish kebab up your ass .
why do you provoke me ?
this young buck .

ginny . it &apos;s tony soprano .
what &apos;s wrong with me ? i &apos;m a mess here with the moving . i &apos;ll get john .
john ! john , get down here ! you got company !

the guinea welcome wagon .
this is for you .
carmela &apos;s bringing something nice to the housewarming for ginny .
this is the great room . i don &apos;t see what &apos;s so great .
it &apos;s mediocre . we got a living room right over there .
i didn &apos;t know you were moving .
ginny wanted to be near her sisters , you know and the schools out here .
we were with carmine . you never mentioned this place .
it &apos;s not his favorite subject .
it &apos;s what , half an hour , 40 minutes over the bridge ?
why didn &apos;t you say you were moving ?
why ?
i gotta find out second hand ?
you care ? you working in a tollbooth ?
besides , i already got the condo in point pleasant .
you should have told me .
i &apos;m telling you now .
this is a place to live . i got no intention of sticking my beak in .
i mean , there &apos;s our family and then there &apos;s the soprano family .
don &apos;t i get to see the rest of this ?
you can help me unstick this rain bird .
i &apos;m a stranger in a strange land out here .
look at this pair .
how many neapolitans to screw in a light bulb ?
there &apos;s only candles in naples . the cardinal controls that racket .
that &apos;s a good one .
use it on your paesans .
we don &apos;t have those bulb jokes . they don &apos;t translate .
tony , i go get a cappuccino .
two thousand of that is mine .
sand monkey on 17 is holding out on us .
so you put his brother in an ambulance ?
he said a bad word .
why would you take jackie &apos;s kid on something like that ?
he &apos;s got to know how it works . kid &apos;s got a chip .
23 and still living at home ?
so he can keep an eye on the prick that &apos;s banging his mom .
no matter how nice i am , he still hates me .
i got a daughter that age . it &apos;s all a mystery .
amen .
being a parent , that &apos;s the hardest job .
it &apos;s harder than this other shit .
like my first marriage and my kid ...
i got news you &apos;re not gonna like .
i &apos;m putting him in as captain .
what ?
no .
fucking gigi , are you shitting me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
this shit with the arab ? i went too far . i &apos;ll take care of it .
this isn &apos;t the first .
at least tell the truth . you want your own there to spy on the aprile crew .
yeah . but i shouldn &apos;t have to .
you got bad tendencies . i sympathize because i do too .
you partnering with joe brooklyn on shit at the port .
a bum decision .
the bottom line speaks . i &apos;m earning my ass .
it &apos;s my decision .
jesus christ , ton . i eat dinner at your house .
this is business .
see ? turned it off .
i &apos;ve been thinking about your course of therapy .
you &apos;re the doctor .
you &apos;re ready to move on to behavior modification therapy .
what &apos;s that mean ? talk to somebody else ?
is this because of what happened last time ?
look , i &apos;m sorry . but like you said , it &apos;s hard to think about that stuff .
it took how long to even remember ?
i realize that .
you know , you &apos;re unbelievable . i ask you to get serious in here .
when it gets hard , you pawn me off on somebody else .
i &apos;m just introducing the idea . something for you to think about .
i &apos;m going to bring in things for you about behavior modification therapy .
yes , he was here earlier today .
yes , we talked about behavior mod , but ...
maybe you could .
listen , i told you i would discharge him ...
... and i will , in my own good time .
i &apos;m going into the garage . i &apos;m gonna lose you . see you later .
shut up . don &apos;t turn around .
i said , shut up . i got a knife . i &apos;ll cut you , bitch .

i thought that i broke my leg ...
... but it &apos;s just really badly sprained .
jesus . oh , god .
bastard .
did they tell you they caught him ?
thank god .
we nabbed somebody with the description not far from the scene .
he &apos;s denying it , but he had her palm pilot .
says he found it .
this is detective piersol . she &apos;s been great .
there &apos;s no way to describe this .
of course .
the son of a bitch . who is he ?
jesus rossi .
rossi ?
lives in elizabeth . 28 , no priors .
that &apos;s an italian name .
am i missing something ?
the girl said he was a puerto rican , that &apos;s all .
i just wanna take a shower , okay ?
we &apos;ll be done here soon .
all right .
mom !
jason .
jesus , mom .
what did these lousy fuckers do ?
i &apos;ll be all right .
i &apos;m gonna kill these fuckers .
jason .
fuck it , dad !
you know the world is a sewer ! nothing but a sewer !
it &apos;s animals out there running wild ! they &apos;re winning !
the police caught the man that did it .
i want five minutes with that asshole !
she doesn &apos;t need to hear it .
why don &apos;t you go outside and settle down ? i &apos;ll be right out .
hello ?
may i speak to anthony soprano ?
he &apos;s not available now . who &apos;s calling ?
this is jennifer melfi . is this mrs. soprano ?
yes , it is . how are you ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling , to cancel his appointment .
he &apos;ll be disappointed . nothing serious .
a car accident , but i &apos;m fine .
i hope they had insurance . you weren &apos;t hurt , i hope ?
my knee got the worst of it . but i &apos;ll be up and about in a couple of days .
i &apos;ll tell him . you stay off of it .
who ate the cake ?
thank you , i will .
thank you for giving him the message .
that &apos;s gotta be some marriage .
hello , kate ? this is jennifer melfi .
i know the phone upsets you , but i need to cancel our appointment .
tell him what ?
that was your therapist .
why don &apos;t you just announce it on wfan ? go find some dust !
she was in a car accident . she has to cancel .
she all right ?
she was okay . she hurt her knee .
her knee ? really ? what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . she didn &apos;t say .
i hope she don &apos;t need stitches . stitches on the knee never heal right .
can leave a very bad scar .
any knee injury can be very serious .
you can get arthritis for the rest of your life .
ask joe namath .
no , thanks .
listen , last time ...
... she mentioned that maybe you would come into my therapy .
give your perspective on the panic attacks and kind of ...
... our home life . whatever .
sure .
but not now . she &apos;s sick .
they call yet ?
no , not yet .
i thought they &apos;d call by now .
they said they &apos;d call when they want us to come down .
look , i &apos;m gonna call them . where &apos;s that detective &apos;s card ?
they said they &apos;d call . i don &apos;t want to bother them .
i &apos;m not gonna let you just wait here . i &apos;m gonna call them .
hello . hi , detective piersol ?
i &apos;m on hold .
she is ? then maybe you can help me . this is dr. la penna .
i &apos;m calling for jennifer melfi .
the rape . right , detective piersol was gonna call ...
... when you were ready for us to come down .
what ? why not ?
what &apos;s going on ?
why ? that &apos;s ridiculous .
what happened ?
it isn &apos;t piersol . she &apos;s moved .
she never said anything .
you just let him go ? are you fucking crazy ?
yes , i do need to use this kind of language !
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re sorry .
richard .
fine , you do that .
you haven &apos;t heard the end of this . i &apos;m contacting my attorney . asshole !
what ?
chain of custody was mishandled ...
... so they let him go .
they let him go ?
somebody misplaced the evidence kit or something ...
i don &apos;t know what they did , those idiots !
is he just out until the trial ? i can identify him .
it &apos;s a legal thing . i think they just have to let him skip .
that &apos;s impossible . you misunderstood .
give me the phone .
i told you what he told me .
before or after you cursed at him ?
give me the phone . i &apos;ll call them . all right . i &apos;ll call .
detective lindheim , please . yes , i &apos;ll hold .
now it &apos;s not even the same cop .
hello . dick la penna again . i want to apologize for losing my temper .
could i please have the phone ?
just a second .
hello ? i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
i don &apos;t know what you people did , but i can identify him .
i don &apos;t know what to say . i &apos;m stunned .
they had to let him go ...
... because they fouled up the chain of custody .
what am i gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna have someone escort you to your car .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
that &apos;s what the counselor told me .
deserted garages are where attacks happen .
you think this is my fault . do you blame me for what happened ?
i told you to call security when it &apos;s late .
it wasn &apos;t late .
this isn &apos;t any good .
let me tell you something .
if i hadn &apos;t have been on the phone with you ...
... maybe i would &apos;ve seen that guy in the stairwell .
what ?
you and your hard @-@ on about my patient !
so it &apos;s my fault ?
you should &apos;ve seen your face ...
... when you heard that that shitbag that raped me had an italian name .
you &apos;re the one who told them he was puerto rican .
what difference does it make ?
are you so ashamed of your background ...
... that any misdeed by an italian somehow damages your self @-@ esteem ?
this is so misdirected .
the whole fucking world &apos;s about your self @-@ esteem .
or maybe you don &apos;t have enough .
jennifer , come on .
fuck you , richard .
jen !
how &apos;s ralphie ? with you over him ?
he busts balls .
he played like it was his idea for me to be aprile crew captain .
what is he gonna do ? tony cut off his cazzi .
very prudently . not that you ain &apos;t gonna hear more later .
most of the conversation was about johnny moving .
ginny told gabriella she needs a big house .
ginny sacrimoni ? what she needs is her own zip code .
jersey &apos;s a small state . she moves in , she could tip it over .
i like something to grab onto .
you grab onto her , your hands will disappear .
she &apos;s so fat , her blood is rag ?
when she goes camping ...
... bears hide their food .
when ginny hauls ass , she &apos;s gotta make two trips .
two guys could fuck her at the same time and never meet .
johnny !
fuck who ?
what ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
nothing . we &apos;re just talking about a girl .
is that all you do , is talk about cooze ?
when we &apos;re not planting potatoes . welcome . you wanna drink ?
i mean it . you don &apos;t keep up with events ?
what ?
it &apos;s all over 1010 wins .
it &apos;s right there in front of you . turn it up .
after years of planning and delays , there &apos;s good news for newark .
coming from the passaic river where assemblyman ronald zellman ...
... held a press conference to announce the release of $ 25 million ...
... in state and federal funds .
25 million .
the time has come to return newark and its waterfront to its past glory .
by the year 2003 , this long @-@ neglected stretch of riverfront ...
... will be alive with condominiums , film studios and public parks .
a self @-@ perpetuating revenue base .
the $ 100 million newark museum of science and trucking ...
... will serve to make this the attraction of the area and beyond .
this fucking busted valise , he &apos;s worth every cent of his cut .
fucking dry wall contracts alone .
thank you very much .
jen , can i come in ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just so frustrated .
we both are .
i just want to go find that bastard and kill him with my hands .
and i could and i would . but i can &apos;t .
they &apos;d put me in jail , that &apos;s how things are .
i know .
you said satriale &apos;s at 1 .
so now you know how it feels .
i know why i &apos;m here and i apologize . i won &apos;t let it happen again .
let &apos;s go .
i asked you to watch out for jackie , jr .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t let the kid get involved in this . &quot;
i hear about a joint , and jackie &apos;s a part of it .
he only drove . i said i was sorry . let me tell you , he was an asset .
he pissed on the car seats , but he handled himself very good .
you listening ? leave him out of it .
he begged me for a taste . he &apos;s the heir apparent .
i don &apos; t want him mixed up in this . i promised his old man .
but it &apos;s all right for me ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
what did you say ?
the life &apos;s good for me , but not for lord fuckpants ?
look , he &apos;s not suited to it . he &apos;s not like you . like us .
kids today , they &apos;re bored , they &apos;re spoiled .
i promised his old man .
what ? you promised him what ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was his best friend .
don &apos;t bust my balls .
i gotta go make a stop in nutley .
come here .
i love you .
you &apos;re a good boy .
lord fuckpants ? whose moniker is that ?
i &apos;m not sure it is a moniker .
hi . come on in .
jesus . what &apos;s the other guy look like ?
that must have been some accident . what happened ?
someone ran a stop sign on eisenhower parkway .
it was one of those things .
i know a woman with one leg .
terrible thing .
last time we met we talked about getting you into behavioral therapy .
i brought a couple of things for you to look at .
&quot; feel the fear and do it anyway . &quot; you gotta be fucking kidding me .
the title leaves something to be desired .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s just your ...
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m sorry . sorry .
you want me to ... ?
it startled me , that &apos;s all .
maybe you came back too soon .
it &apos;s better for me to be busy .
right .
i &apos;m okay . really .
and i appreciate your concern .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with the world .
a person is minding their own business ...
... and some fucking asshole comes out and smashes into them .
you can &apos;t control everything .
you can get pissed off .
and then what ? lose control ?
you direct your anger where it belongs .
you have panic attacks .
panic occurs when feelings of anger , revenge , whatever , overwhelm you .
that &apos;s where behavioral therapy comes in .
it can teach you to control those triggers .
how do you get people to do what you want ?
you tell your mother it &apos;s hers anytime she wants it .
how was your cousin &apos;s shower ?
it sounded like screaming .
i wondered whose z24 was in the driveway . you get a car ?
yeah .
where did i put the sleeves to that samovar ?
you want anything ? a coke ?
no , i &apos;m set , ton .
i heard ralph cifaretto got passed over .
you heard about what ? who ?
i &apos;m saying that was probably smart .
he &apos;s kind of a cool guy ...
that &apos;s none of your concern .
you were going to college . i hear shit from chris ?
you didn &apos;t talk to chris . shit .
that &apos;s right .
i promised your dad .
don &apos;t make this hard . i got a son to bust my balls .
i &apos;m home !
ma ?
hey , jackie . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m waiting for you .
what ? no hello ?
i need $ 200 to put in my student account .
we haven &apos;t talked for weeks .
i look forward to total independence , believe me .
african @-@ americans go to columbia . some are my friends .
my ass . on my couch , watching tv with his shoes off with you ?
meadow , when did you get here ?
see you . say hi to your mom .
come into the city , we &apos;ll do sushi .
i won &apos;t say anything .
you just remember what we talked about .
i &apos;ll have a chicken avocado wrap , no dressing . and a coke .
one number three , dressing on the side .
thanks .
excuse me . wait a minute .
let go of me ! let the fuck go of me !
we don &apos;t wanna continue . give us leg .
what leg ?
don &apos;t do this to me . don &apos;t push me to edge . repent !
motherfucker , do you know who my brother is ?
mother , what did you say ?
mother ...
those records were all i had of my mother . what could they mean to her ?
are you people really so callous ... ?
fuck you . you are callous .
oh , my god ! help me , please !
i felt such a sense of relief .
i felt safe for the first time .
empowered .
the vending machine ?
my guilt for putting myself in harm &apos;s way .
i read about that too , that honeymooner ...
... who rocked a vending machine and it fell on him and killed him .
the dog though , i don &apos;t know .
the forbidden part of your psyche , murderous rage .
yeah , but at first i thought he was after me .
the door said , &quot; danger . &quot;
actually , no , it said , &quot; high voltage . call njge before digging . &quot;
&quot; jersey gas and electric . &quot;
was richard anywhere in all this ?
no .
oh , my god . the dog .
what ?
a rottweiler , elliot .
big head . massive shoulders .
descendent of the dog used by the roman armies to guard their camps .
i didn &apos;t know that .
digging ?
who do i dig with ? and who &apos;s dangerous ?
who could i sic on that son of a bitch to tear him to shreds ?
let me tell you something .
no feeling has ever been so sweet as to see that pig beg ...
... and plead and scream for life .
because the justice system is fucked up , elliot .
richard &apos;s attorney is in this at $ 300 an hour .
meanwhile , that employee of the month cocksucker ...
... is back on the street , and who &apos;s gonna stop him ? you ?
jennifer ...
civilization ...
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not going to break the social compact .
but that &apos;s not saying there &apos;s not a certain satisfaction in knowing ...
... that i could have that asshole squashed like a bug .
if i wanted .
what happened ?
janice ?
i can &apos;t drive . and they broke three ribs .
what did i tell you ? i told you not to mess with those people .
i was supposed to be married at this point .
yeah ? so ?
the man i loved died .
this is all i fucking need . thanks , janice .
what ?
what do you mean ?
they slapped my sister around .
i have to get payback . it &apos;s always something .
every time i hear your voice , i know it &apos;s gonna cost me .
time . money . you never do anything to simplify my life .
i stole a woman &apos;s prosthetic leg . when did i get like this ?
you really wanna know ?
when richie died .
till that time , i was functioning at a very high level .
there &apos;s only one trajectory for me .
really ?
god .
you see what i mean ?
all this soul @-@ searching , it &apos;s always on my dime .
i &apos;ve hit bottom , tony .
but it &apos;s odd because i feel born again in the lord .
and i prayed to god and i asked him ...
... to forgive svetlana for what she &apos;s done .
we &apos;ve been here before . with vishnu and richard @-@ fucking @-@ alpert ...
... and the coyote spirit . you know what it always spells ?
trouble for the rest of us . so put your fucking clothes on .
seriously . i gotta get out of here .
i give myself up utterly and totally to god .
if this is the bottom .
if not ...
you can go now .
billing needs to see you . follow the blue line .
carmela .
gorgeous as ever .
my god , this house .
you got one .
move to jersey , but maybe take a little bit of a halfway step ?
fucking wife of mine .
gentlemen .
&quot; what we do in life echoes in eternity . &quot;
he &apos;s obsessed with gladiator .
come on , it &apos;s a great fucking film . &quot; strength and honor . &quot;
