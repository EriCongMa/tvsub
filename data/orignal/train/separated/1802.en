"LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH"
Surgeons don't compromise.
Derek Shepherd--
multiple hand fractures with a median nerve injury.
Arizona Robbins-- open femur fracture
with resultant above-knee amputation.
Lexie Grey-- deceased.
Mark Sloan-- deceased.
This doesn't include extreme...
We defy death. We exceed perfection.
We operate for 17 hours straight if we have to.
...wish for me to extend their deepest condolences.
How is--how is the investigation going?
Have they found what caused the crash?
The investigation could take years.
That's why we want to help you put this tragedy behind you.
I think you mean,
your clients would like to put it behind them.
So I am authorized at this time
to propose a onetime settlement.
Bayview Aeronautics takes your loss seriously.
Now the settlement agreement must be unanimous,
and it releases Bayview Aeronautics
from any and all other claims, known or unknown,
but... most important,
it will allow you to put this painful time behind you
and move on with your lives.
We aren't built to settle.
But that doesn't mean we won't.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a lot of money.
And they need an answer in three days.
Okay.
How have you been?
Okay.
You?
I'm fine.
Good.
So, uh...
you'll call me when you decide?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Should we settle?
Should we not settle?
I don't know.
We should go to sleep.
Do you want to keep the lights on or off tonight?
On, please.
Do you know what this money could mean for us,
for Sofia?
I mean, she won't have to take out loans for med school.
We'd be taken care of...
you and me and Sofia.
I think that's what Mark would want.
You know what I want... more than anything?
I want to know what you're thinking,
what you want.
Just...
Okay, well, the home health care nurse will be here soon.
Try to be nice.
Don't throw things at this one, okay?
Just...
Let her help you.
Okay. I'll see you tonight.
Hey, Alex...
why did an intern just give me a compliment
on the crown moldings in my empty house?
Are you still sleeping there?
Chicks like it better than the on-call room.
Okay, that's disgusting.
Now I have to have the place tented.
Give me back my key.
You don't even live there anymore.
What do you care?
Key. Please.
Hey, you guys.
Can you believe we're in the attendings' lounge?
April, what are you doing here?
Oh, uh, Hunt came and got me on the farm in Moline.
I was giving the pigs their breakfast,
and I turn around, and there's Dr. Hunt, offering me my job back.
He didn't tell you guys?
Did anyone else see Dr. Hunt in the barnyard?
When he appeared unto you, was he glowing at all?
April?
Hunt hired her back.
We think.
It might have been jesus.
I thought you went to Tulane.
Uh, yeah. No, I-I-I changed my mind.
Hey, you people are attendings.
You do not change clothes in front of everyone
like animals or interns,
because nobody wants to see all that.
Apparently Kepner does.
What?
N-no, I d--I don't. I-I wasn't e--I...
Gotta go.
Me too. Welcome back.
Glad you back.
I am back...
Too.
I'm a-also glad
to be back.
Okay.
Morning, Dr. Bailey.
I cannot get used to having them in the attendings' lounge.
Well, I'm still getting used to having you in here.
Dr. Yang--
Famous and infamous.
Come on in and take a load off.
You took a break.
I did.
Some R&R.
Yes.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Fantastic.
What'd you see?
I went to the Mall of America. I road the roller coaster.
I purchased Jeggings.
I'm ready to get back to work.
You went on the internet and searched "Mall of America."
I am gonna be a team player. I mean it.
I heard what you said, sir.
Then put on some scrubs, young lady.
Thank you.
I saw you have a laser revascularization--
You'll be working with Dr. Thomas for now.
I'll believe team player when I see it, Dr. Yang.
I got your text. What do we got?
16-year-old kid, fished her out of the sound,
Sailing accident.
You mind?
Sorry.
Why are you following me?
I'm your intern for the day.
Oh. Well, hello, intern. You have a name?
Jo Wilson.
Oh, nice. I like chicks with boys names.
Karev.
What? I do. It's hot.
Stop sleeping with your coworkers. It ruins them.
I slept with you.
And now I no longer sleep with men.
Roxie Meyers, 30,
here for excess skin removal after a 100-pound weight loss
two years ago.
117 pounds.
Frank.
I can't help it if I'm proud of you.
And we've set up a consult from general for the hernia repair?
I did, yeah.
Hey, I'm it.
I am--I'm your consult.
Okay. Hi.
Uh, Dr. Kepner is going to repair your hernia.
So I'll just need to go over some incision points.
Um, honey, could you...
They want me to take off my robe.
Roxie, this is a big operation.
I want to know everything that's gonna happen to you.
Frank, please.
This is my fiancee,
love of my life.
You guys do a good job, okay?
Of course.
I'll be right outside, babe.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Now I'm gonna start with some incisions here...
and here.
The man's a saint.
We've been together two years and we still haven't...
you know, had sex.
I mean, when we cuddle, wh-when he squeezes me here,
it makes me cringe.
I just want to feel... pretty.
You're already pretty.
You sound like Frank.
Do you have any questions for me before the surgery?
Just one. When?
I'm sorry?
I think she wants to know when she and Frank--
When can I jump his bones?
Your incisions will be healed in about two weeks.
So after that, you and Frank
can be as physical as you like.
Two weeks? Okay. Wow.
I just got butterflies.
Okay, Emery, we're gonna need to take a look at your leg.
You and you, start cutting off the splint
so we can see what we've got.
I can't feel my foot.
Can you tell us what happened?
Yeah, this massive wave came up
and the mast, like, crushed my leg,
and then--and then Pickle just rolled over.
Pickle?
My boat. God, I can't believe I lost her.
Why can't I feel my foot?
Okay, who else was on the boat with you?
No one. I-I'm doing a solo sail from Mexico to Alaska.
Oh, jeez.
Oh, my god.
Doppler. Doppler.
Is that...
Her tibia and fibula, I think.
What's wrong?
Everything's fine. Just try to stay calm, okay?
Do you know where your parents are?
I sailed here from Mexico by myself.
I don't need you to wait for my parents.
Tell me what's happening.
I'm not getting a pulse.
Okay, Emery, I am so sorry,
but we might not be able to save your foot, okay?
No!
Your injury's very severe.
It's mangled and there's no blood flow.
Give her 5 of morphine!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
She moved her toes with a nearly severed foot
so the tibial nerve's probably still intact, right?
So, Dr. Torres, you think you can actually save the foot?
Well, when we get in there and do some nerve testing,
we'll be able to assess the damage better.
I spoke to her parents. Their flight gets in late tonight.
Great. Do you want to scrub in?
Hell, yeah.
All right.
This might take a while.
I need you to stay behind
and monitor my pre- and post-ops.
But, um...
I had hoped--since I was the one that saw the toes move,
I'd hoped that I--
But you need me to monitor your pre- and post-ops.
Got it. Great.
You could've let her scrub in or stand in the back and observe.
Why?
Because she has joy.
I like joy, excitement, happiness.
People looking at me like I know things.
She practically squealed when I mentioned nerve testing.
There needs to be more squealing.
I can squeal if you want me to.
That sounds dirty and inappropriate.
Oh, which I hear is your specialty these days.
I brought a tater tot hot dish.
You didn't?
Rina also brought tater tot hot dish.
It's pop pop's favorite.
Oh, I know it is, love. That's why I brought it.
Okay, you know pop pop has an enlarged heart.
So he can't be having
a tater tot hot dish.
Not even a bite? Ohh.
It's his last meal.
No, you get a last meal before they kill you.
We're not planning on doing that.
Dr. Yang.
Oh, hi, Dr. Thomas.
Never show up in Mr. Patel's room during visiting hours.
Oh, now you tell me.
Are you still planning on doing
the ventricular reduction surgery?
Yes, I spoke to him about it this morning.
Wouldn't an l-vad be in order?
An l-vad is a band-aid.
Ventricular reduction is a repair.
You'll be hacking off working heart muscle.
So that what's left can work more efficiently.
This is an extremely high-risk procedure when there's a simple fix.
People die from this surgery.
Not when I do it, they don't.
How does such a tiny human make such a big mess?
Should we settle?
It's a lot of money.
We could stop work, travel for a while,
show Zola the world.
Zola wants to see the park
and the pond and the turtle that lives in the pond.
Okay, so we don't settle.
Not settling means what, years of litigation
and thousands of dollars looking for answers?
And it's not gonna bring Mark or Lexie back.
Traveling the world sounds better.
Yeah, it does.
Hey
What?
So you realize, Zola's sleeping...
and all we're doing is talking?
Oh, you're right.
I can do that--something about that right now.
Let me get that little. Ooh, what is this?
There's a block under my-- Okay.
Shh. Don't wake her up. Be quiet.
Okay. Shh.
Uh, we...
We should agree on the positioning
for the incisions for our surgery
so that I can have good visibility for the hernia.
Yeah. Um...
I'm gonna go in here and then here.
Great. Good. Okay.
That looks good.
Good.
So you staying here or a hotel?
What's going on?
Oh, yes.
Here un-until I find a place.
I didn't call you, April, because I didn't--
I'm revirginizing.
Um, it's... it's a thing,
revirginizing.
It involves a lot of prayer,
which I had time to do in Moline,
staring at the 'n sync posters on my wall,
which kind of makes me think of Jesus as Justin Timberlake,
but my pastor says that's totally fine,
you know, as long as I'm still talking to Him,
keeping the lines of communication open.
Okay, April, you--
It's my second chance, Jackson.
And I didn't think I'd get one,
but then dr. Hunt showed up in Moline
and offered my job back,
and that was my sign
that I get to recommit myself to god.
I-I can accept His forgiveness
and--and have a second chance.
A do-over, you know, without all the mistakes,
just slate wiped clean.
I am--
Revirginizing.
Yes.
Which is really your way of saying
that you want to pretend that you and I never happened.
No, that is not...
It's--it's--it's not that simple.
Okay. That'll do it. Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.
Dr. Yang.
How is the great surgeon from Seattle on this fine day?
Great.
You can't fool me.
I am a reader of faces, and your face tells me--
This is one of the finest Cardiothoracic centers in the country.
I came here to do innovative, cutting-edge surgeries with you
not ventricular reductions with Thomas
is what my face tells you.
Look, everybody has to take a shift.
Babysit the old man.
Put your time in, and I'll see to it...
that you join me in the O.R. very soon.
On something good?
Well, I'm consulting on a guy with Mitral Regurg.
Oh, are you doing a Mitral Annuloplasty?
Probably.
And I'll relocate the tip of the posterior papillary muscle.
Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
Cardio humor.
Oh, yes, sir.
I am laughing, just not externally.
Let me see a smile then.
No, let me see the great Dr. Yang
turn her frown upside down.
Better.
I hope you won't be offended if I tell you
that you have a very nice smile.
Look at this!
Kepner is doing an umbilical hernia.
Her first week back.
She failed her boards.
She was fired, twice.
The closest that girl has been to an O.R. in months
is what, the Moline large animal vet?
Her head is not in the game.
She has... other things on her mind,
things I don't even want to think about.
So... what, you're gonna pull her off the surgery,
do it yourself?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I'm getting her a babysitter.
Hey, Cristina.
April's back.
Uh, yeah, I heard.
Owen went to a pig farm?
Oh, so you're talking to Owen?
Yeah, about the settlement.
Hey, what's up, Yang?
I'm about to be accomplice to a murder.
I always knew you'd find your specialty.
What are you...
Actually, I know,
let's pretend this never happened.
What?
Oh, show me. Show me.
Dr. Bailey, all respect,
but I can handle a hernia repair on my own.
Well, you've been working with pigs.
Maybe she's worried you'll slaughter someone out of habit.
So have you thought about the settlement?
What do you want to do?
Oh... I don't know.
Whatever everybody else wants to do.
I'm a team player, Mer.
Apparently, so am I.
We were able to restore blood flow to your daughter's foot.
So it looks like we're gonna be able to save it.
It'll be a long, hard process, but she's tough.
She sure is.
Oh, you have no idea.
Mom, look.
Oh, that's a beautiful boat, but--
Yeah, they want to donate it
'cause they heard about the accident.
I think we need to wait and hear what Dr. Torres has to say.
No, if I get back out there within the next two weeks,
I can still make it before the weather gets really bad.
Oh, I could just amputate your foot,
and you could be up and out of here in a week.
Or I could get you close to full function back,
but it means a series of pretty big operations
over a few months,
and you have to stay off the foot completely.
Fine. Let's do it.
Actually, you guys have to give consent.
Well, is...
Just say you consent.
Yeah.
I brought you a coffee.
Oh, wow. Thanks.
You have a nice smile.
Thanks.
And, uh... just beautiful...
eyes.
You know, if you want to drab--
grab a drink later or...
I know this Mexican place--
Okay, okay, okay, you're flirting with me,
which is really sweet or would be really sweet
if you were into ladies,
but I'm guessing that you're not a lady lover,
'cause you also look terrified that I might say yes.
You're poking a bear,
a very horny bear.
And what would you do if the bear said yes?
And there you'd be,
trading sexual favors for...
I don't know what it is you want from me, so...
You're gonna have to tell me.
I was wondering if it would be possible
to scrub in on your next surgery.
Okay, "A," Never trade sex for scrubbing in
because that's just skanky.
Save it for actually getting to cut.
And "B," You're giving coffee to the wrong person.
Oh, Alex.
Your intern brought you coffee.
Oh, cool.
I was wondering if it would be possible
to scrub in on your next surgery.
That's not gonna happen.
But hey, grab me another coffee. That was great.
Go.
Shoot. This defect's too big.
I'm gonna need some mesh. Suction.
Here's an idea-- let's just pretend
that the patient never even had a hernia,
then you wouldn't have to do anything.
Would you stop? This is not a joke to me.
No, you said you're pretending that--
What are we talking about?
If you would just listen.
I'm not pretending it never happened.
What never happened?
It happened. I know it happened.
Could someone just please--
But now I am wiping the slate clean.
By acting like it never happened.
No!
What never happened?
Nothing!
I...
My...
God.
Oh, Derek.
You--you doing a consult?
No, actually, I have a question for you.
Do you remember the Donna Drake case?
About six years ago, mother of twin girls.
Remember it? I can't ever forget it.
I won't ever forget it.
How much did the hospital end up settling with the family?
Whoa. Wow. It was a lot.
Uh, I can check the exact amount,
but it was definitely the largest settlement that I can remember.
Because it was our fault that, uh, she died.
It's pretty standard.
The bigger the mistake, the bigger the payout.
Oh, they offering you a pretty big settlement?
Yeah.
Yeah, they are.
So you'll meet with everyone else tomorrow,
see what they want to do, and that's that, I guess.
I mean, um...
I guess I-I-I want to go with what everyone else decides.
Okay.
Oh, there is this woman with, like, the most
nasal voice you've ever heard of.
She does the code calls here.
They're unintelligible.
I mean, everyone understands 'em, but to me,
it's like a foreign language.
That's funny.
Oh, yeah. You got-- You got hear it.
Sure.
You know what? Oh, just wait. It'll happen any second.
Okay.
She was a virgin.
I know that.
You defiled a virgin.
Stop hitting my head. I sw--
I will go full crazy on you. All right?
I am a grown ass man. She's a grown woman.
Yeah, but she's--
She's what, April Kepner?
Believe me, she is grown.
I didn't manipulate her.
I didn't defile her or trick her.
I didn't take her virginity.
She... she gave it to me.
All right? This isn't about something I did to her.
This is something we did together,
and she can't handle that.
So she is praying...
to Justin Timberlake, apparently.
And I'm pissed. And... it's a mess.
So just stop hitting my head.
So Alex is a diseased man-whore again...
And April Kepner is no longer a virgin.
Wow. I missed a lot with that plane crash.
Yeah, you missed a whole lot.
The chief banged my mom.
What? The...
Owen banged--
Webber. Webber. Dr. Webber banged my mom.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, I know.
Well... if it makes you feel any better,
he banged my mom, too.
That makes me feel worse.
Just let her come down here for a little while.
Did you check the I's and O's on 31-50?
I did this morning.
She doesn't stop crapping and peeing
just because you want to watch a surgery.
Go and check them again.
What is your problem?
My problem is, I have 40 patients on my service.
The new peds attending is an idiot,
and I need help.
So until your wife comes back to the hospital,
I need my interns to actually work.
My wife is disabled.
My daughter's father is dead.
There's nothing we can do about that,
but this money will pay for Arizona's rehab.
It would take care of our little girl,
Mark's little girl.
This is a huge amount of money.
It's a life-changing amount of money.
All right, so you're saying we take it.
I'm just saying,
you don't walk away from a number like this, right?
Well, I'm still talking to Cristina,
but I think she'd want to take it, yeah.
Mer?
Yeah. I mean, I guess, yeah.
Derek, what do you think? It has to be unanimous.
What do you say?
I say, we have until tomorrow.
I googled you.
I know how to do it even though I'm old.
I know what googling is.
I googled you, and it said that you were in a plane crash.
Am I talking to myself?
I would rather talk about the medicine.
Okay.
Notice how I close without using felt pledgets. Hmm?
You impressed? I know you are.
You're just too prideful to admit it,
but that's okay.
It comes together impeccably.
I didn't think that was possible.
I mean, I've tried to suture myocardium before
without synthetic patches and couldn't get it to hold.
Yes, well, the trick is
to use a double layer of zero vicryl.
It's my signature.
I'm the only one in the country who can do it
because I've devoted my life to doing it.
I don't go home to family
and, uh, chitchat.
I go to bed
thinking about this technique.
So...
what is your signature move, hmm?
Oh, I-I don't--
Life is short, you know?
You've seen that yourself.
So you better get at it.
There it is.
Now if you had put in your beloved l-vad,
he would've died waiting for a heart transplant,
which would never happen.
This way, Bo Bo has a chance at life.
Pop Pop.
What? Speak up.
Uh, nothing, sir.
The settlement meeting is at 8:00 tomorrow night.
Are you gonna go?
You're going, so I don't have to.
See how that works?
I'm going to speak for Mark, who can't speak for himself.
See how that works?
You should be at that meeting.
You should speak for yourself. I-I wasn't there.
I--it's not a decision I should be making for you.
You weren't shy about making other decisions for me.
What's different now?
I mean, I think you're on a roll.
I can't do this.
Say it, 'cause it was perfect.
"It's not a decision that I should be making for you."
Say it.
Stop.
Say it again.
"It's not a decision that I should be making for you!
"As opposed to hacking off a limb--
That's the kind of decision I should make for you."
Fine. Don't go. I will make all the decisions.
Just so you know,
I'm gonna vote to take the settlement for Sofia,
because Mark would want her to have the money.
I think Mark would want you
to pick up your daughter when she's crying.
I guess he's gonna have to deal with disappointment,
just like the rest of us.
Mer, we chopped up this heart, and it was amazing.
I mean, you should see how this guy handles myocardium.
Are you sleeping with him?
What? No. He's like 100.
You know who did sleep together? April and Jackson.
No way. Kepner did it?
She did it.
Finally.
Except she's not doing it again.
What do you mean?
Clean slate. She's revirginizing.
Oh, please.
No, she's there, he's there.
All she has to do is hear his voice,
and she's not gonna be able to think straight.
All right, now keep in mind,
there's still a lot of swelling and bruising.
It's okay, Roxie.
It's more than okay. It's...
There's nothing to squeeze.
Hey, Rox, the cafeteria was out of lemonade,
so I got you--oh.
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry. I gotta... go. Excuse me.
Dr. Karev, I've rounded on your pre-ops, your post-ops.
I've run your labs,
and I'm updating your charts right now.
What about my consult on the J.R.A. kid?
You schedule that yet?
Um, no, I-I haven't had a chance to--
You kidding me?
Stop with the charting. Do it now.
Or don't.
No, I'm--I'm sorry. I'll schedule it.
God, I can't believe I'm crying in front of my boss.
I told myself that I wouldn't do this.
Look, I'm not supposed to be this person.
I don't fail.
I was valedictorian of my high school,
graduated cum laude from Princeton.
I was first in my class at Harvard.
How am I not getting this?
I've somehow become the loser intern.
I-I blew the appy with Dr. Grey.
You've been piling on the scut,
so clearly I pissed you off somehow.
You get scut because you're an intern.
That's what interns do. It's the best way to learn.
And... you haven't pissed me off.
I haven't?
No, I'm just...
Dr. Torres may have told me not to...
flirt with you.
Because it may be possible
that I dated a couple of other interns.
You mean Heather.
Yeah, her.
And Leah.
And Susan, Stacey, Tina, Irene.
Don't worry about the flirting,
I have absolutely no interest in you,
since you've already screwed every one of my friends.
I should go.
8:00 A.M. tomorrow, I'm doing a Nissen.
Don't be late.
Mrs. James,
I just checked on Emery. She's doing great.
And she promised to, uh, take it easy before her follow-up.
She's lying.
A sailing company donated a new boat, and she took it.
She's going back out there as soon as you let her out of here.
What?
She's always been like this, headstrong, independent--
Okay, if she goes out there before this is healed properly,
she'll lose that foot.
Maybe you could keep her here,
say that she has to stay here while she recuperates.
I can't keep her here without medical necessity.
If we stop her from sailing, she will hate us.
So let her.
Stop being scared of your own daughter.
She's 16. She named a boat "Pickle."
She's a little girl.
Be her parent.
She needs you to be the bad guy.
I could get in a lot of trouble for this.
The plane's aft broke away from the main cabin.
The tail was recovered in, uh, Zone One.
That's a keel beam.
It was recovered in Zone Two,
about half a mile away.
And that's the R-3 cabin door.
What happens to all this?
What happens if we settle?
I--I'm s-sorry I ran off like that. I just...
So I am not gonna pretend it didn't happen.
I can't do that.
I know. I, um, me either.
I c--I can't stop thinking about it.
The more I think about it, the more--
the more I try not to think about it,
I'm thinking about it, so--
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Do you want to get married?
Uh, what?
Because if you're serious about this whole revirginizing thing,
that means that the next guy that you sleep with
is probably gonna be your husband.
Right? That's what you want.
And I am not ready to be anybody's husband.
And I really don't think you're ready to be anybody's wife.
So let's remember that it happened,
make sure it doesn't happen again.
Unless we want it to,
unless we are...
ready.
I'm, um, I can't...
I can't be near you or I might...
Me too.
Okay, so we, um--
We stay away from each other...
for--for a while.
Okay.
Um, so I'm just gonna...
walk away now.
Bye.
Oh, God.
It is a horror movie inside this microwave,
a horror movie.
Oh, they are... entitled, ungrateful children,
and they should know better.
Not that I care.
I don't care. I'm done caring.
Okay, so what's really going on?
Tuck let go of my hand.
Uh, what?
Tuck-- he let go of my hand.
I took him to his first day of kindergarten,
and I was, you know, ready for the tears and the good-bye,
and how hard it was gonna be.
And he just let go of my hand.
He didn't even look back.
He walked in, saw a toy he liked,
and didn't look back.
I called his dad.
He was... busy.
He's getting married again,
which is very nice, I-I like her.
Whatever. He was busy.
So I called Ben,
and he was studying up to observe his first laparoscopic surgery.
He was so excited--
Everybody's moving on.
And I'm here, doing appys and choles,
'cause what a general surgery attending does,
appys and choles.
While everybody else is off conquering new things,
I'm stuck.
And I didn't care. You know, I mean, this was my choice.
I'm not even sure I noticed...
Until Tuck let go of your hand.
Till Tuck let go of my hand.
You know what happens when someone lets go of your hand?
What?
You get it back.
It's a good thing.
You know, interns let go,
and... Tuck let go,
and even Ben let go.
And they're all still there.
They all still love you.
But it means you get your hand back.
It means you have time--
Not to wash the dishes...
To do something with,
to get out there,
to find diseases to cure,
to take it to the next level.
Hell, it means invent the Bailey method.
But you gotta get out there, do something.
And don't look back.
Yeah, we're meeting in an hour about the settlement.
Have you decided?
No, I don't care.
So...do you want to think about it some more or...
No, no, I just...
Oh, settle or...or don't settle.
It...it doesn't matter.
You know, whatever the group wants to do is fine with me.
Okay.
I'll...I'll call you and I'll let you know.
No, no, don't. I mean, just send me a check.
Or, you know, I'll...I'll get the...the lawyers to call.
Okay.
We can't keep doing this.
I know.
I'm here now.
I know.
So...
Bye.
Bye.
Arizona, I've come to get you.
You're going to this meeting. It starts in 20 minutes.
Arizona?
Where are you?
Oh, my...are you okay?
Where's the nurse?
I d...I didn't like her. So I fired her.
Oh, great.
Great. That's just great.
Why are you...
I thought...
That I could get to the toilet on time by myself.
Apparently, I was wrong.
Did you fall? Are...are you okay?
Do I look okay?
I am sitting in a pool of my own urine.
I'm putting you in the shower.
No, just get out!
Hey!
Do not talk to me that way.
Please! Please get out!
Arizona.
Did you hear me? You did this!
I can't even pee by myself!
Yeah, and it's a problem because you now stink!
This bathroom stinks!
Get off of me!
I am not sharing my home with anybody who smells like this!
Get off of me! Get off of me!
Get off of me!
I have nowhere else to go!
This is my life now, too!
You know, I was, too.
In a plane crash.
In Vietnam.
Everyone on board the plane died
but me.
I never,
I never have told anybody about that around here.
You know, it's...
Would you like a smoke?
Oh, I don't smoke.
Me neither.
Not anymore.
I mean, these things could kill you, you know?
What?
Well, you know...
It seems like...
Everything kills you these days.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry.
So we've all agreed and we...
No. Wait.
We can't do this.
I saw the plane.
I went to the hangar and I saw the...
pieces of our plane
laid out on the floor like a jigsaw puzzle.
If we agree to settle, they do the investigation,
and we can't do anything with the results.
Bayview Aeronautics will take the results and act accordingly.
Oh, I'm sure you'll be very thorough.
Big companies are always very good about self-policing.
Mistakes happen, Derek. Accidents happen.
We make mistakes that can cost lives, too.
Yes, we do.
But when we do, we have M&Ms.
We pore over the files.
We make sure it never happens again.
And we try to make sure
future patients never have to go through that grief.
They don't have to sleep with the lights on every night
because the darkness is too much.
We just can't stand by and let this happen
to other people's...
Lexies and Marks.
We have to do something about it.
We have to make this right.
If I could interject for a moment...
Be quiet.
Your decision does have to be unanimous.
She said, be quiet.
Callie...
What are you thinking?
My advice at this time...
Shut up.
You're not one of us.
You don't know. You have no idea what we've been...
Derek's right. We shouldn't take the money.
We can't take it.
When we follow our hearts,
when we choose not to settle,
It's funny, isn't it?
A weight lifts...
The sun shines a little brighter...
And, for a brief moment at least...
