how did it go last night ?
well , i didn &apos;t see joshua.but i did punch a girl in the face .
what ? why ?
the whole night was horrible . it was pouring .
there was no rachel greene on the list . but there was a rachel greep .
so did you get to meet her ?
there is no rachel greep . but this girl overheard us .
and she said , &quot; i &apos;m rachel greep ! &quot; and he let her in .
so you hit her ?
no , she was already in.this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella
... so i clocked her .
all i wanted was a few hours ... outside of work to see joshua
... so he could go ahead and start falling in love with me .
pheebs .
honey , that &apos;s your name .
that &apos;s short for phoebe ? i thought that &apos;s what we called each other .
you &apos;re wearing pants !
that &apos;s right .
where are the guys ? i &apos;m ready to get drunk and see strippers .
it &apos;s 9 : 30 a.m.they got a breakfast buffet .
hello ! oh , hey , ross
let me talk to him !
oh , my god !
can &apos;t i just ?
it &apos;s my phone and she &apos;s shush
please !
what &apos;s he saying ?
he &apos;s with emily in vermont.what ? oh , my god !
who the hell is emily ? no .
when we first met her , she was soaking , her feet were wet ....
who wouldn &apos;t be miserable ?
i &apos;m telling you , once l got her into a dry pair of shoes ... she was a totally different person .
they &apos;re in vermont ? how did this happen ?
how &apos;d he end up in vermont with that witch ?
maybe she doesn &apos;t hit him all the time .
there &apos;s a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard !
i got to go ! there &apos;s a deer eating fruit from the orchard !
he had to go . there was a deer eating fruit from the orchard .
i don &apos;t get this . she was horrible !
i &apos;m going to go stand over there .
why do you care ? i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m just upset that i &apos;m getting nowhere with joshua .
you do not just meet someone and go flitting off to vermont !
when you first met barry , you flitted off to vail .
could you , just for once ... not remember every little thing ?
so you know , when &apos;s he getting back ? a couple of days .
i knew something like this would happen .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t go back a phase !
you &apos;re thinking about time . you can &apos;t go back in time .
why don &apos;t you do your phase two strip club thing with us ?
we can be guys !
no , you can &apos;t .
let us be guys ! maybe we want to be guys .
no , you don &apos;t . you &apos;d be all hairy and wouldn &apos;t live as long .
would you just stop being such a wuss
and get those off ? and come with us and watch naked girls dance !
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
joey tribbiani . i &apos;m here .
calm down , we got time . we &apos;re running late.all set .
look at that . charlton heston eating licorice .
yeah , he loves them . i &apos;ve never seen him with
what the hell is that ?
what smells so bad ? you .
i could see why you would think that . but
you know who it is ? you ?
no , no . it &apos;s heston .
what ?
he reeks like he went on a three @-@ day fishing trip , then ate licorice .
no way . he &apos;s the only one with a shower in his dressing room .
really ? a shower ?
which room might that be ? the one with &quot; heston &quot; on it .
interesting .
i got some ones . you want to put them in her panties ?
no , thanks , mom !
that.you have to put that out because i &apos;m pregnant .
maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club .
it &apos;s not my baby .
very good .
really good . i enjoyed it . very exotic .
i just checked our messages and joshua didn &apos;t call .
you &apos;d think he &apos;d be worried about me not showing up .
you know what makes it worse ? ross is all happy in vermont .
come on , look where you are !
another round of daiquiris.virgin for me .
don &apos;t let me leave without the name of that carpet guy .
cherry , you know , you ...
come on !
you know what ? i &apos;ll go home and call kathy .
if it &apos;ll help.that was a test .
in a few hours , i &apos;ll be drunk.i &apos;ll want to call her . you &apos;ll have to stop me .
then i &apos;ll be so drunk , i &apos;ll want to call janice .
you should ! how is she ?
i think somebody needs another lap dance .
who &apos;s in there ?
how you doing ? who in the hell are you ?
would you believe me if i said i was kirk douglas ?
put some pants on , kid , so i can kick your butt .
no , wait . you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m an actor .
joey tribbiani . i &apos;m doing a scene with you today .
and i stink !
you &apos;re in this picture ?
i &apos;m a cop who won &apos;t work with you because you &apos;re a loose cannon .
anyway , i &apos;m really sorry.but i stink .
joey , right ?
every actor , one time or another
every actor thinks he stinks .
even laurence olivier sometimes thought he stank .
bob redford won &apos;t even watch himself .
you don &apos;t understand .
listen to me .
i don &apos;t know one actor worth his salt ...
... who , one time in his career , didn &apos;t say , &quot; god , i stink ! &quot;
i just did a scene out there . first take , i stunk the place up .
the important thing , and you must remember ... no matter how badly you think you stink
... you must never , ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower !
do you understand me ? yes , sir . i &apos;m very sorry .
wait a minute ! take your pants .
sorry . i &apos;m really sorry .

he still hasn &apos;t called .
who , josh ? it &apos;s joshua .
he doesn &apos;t like &quot; josh &quot; ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to put my sweats back on .
you know what ? you were right .
we weren &apos;t great at being guys . you know why ?
because we &apos;re girls .
you know what girls are good at ?
stripping !
no , listening ! sit .
maybe it would really , really help if you would just talk .
yeah , come on . what &apos;s going on in there ?
and you know , if you want to cry , that &apos;s okay too .
i &apos;m going to have to ask you all to leave .
come on . chandle
forget it . we tried , but phase three is a lost cause .
those strippers were hot , and l couldn &apos;t picture myself with them .
they really were pretty , weren &apos;t they ?
i liked that fighter pilot one . -candy ?
she was so spunky !
i think if i were going to be with a woman ...
... it &apos;d be with someone like michelle.she was just so petite .
for me , it would have to be chantal .
she had the smoothest skin.i stuck that dollar in her g @-@ string
and grazed her thigh . phase three !
i just achieved phase three !
i am totally picturing you with all those women !
that &apos;s not phase three.well , i &apos;m there too !
are we all together in a group ? stop it , you &apos;re killing me !
i think i moved on to phase four ! what is that ?
i don &apos;t want a relationship ever ! i just want sex with strippers and my friends !
come on.let me see that smile .
i don &apos;t want to.please ?
i wanted to go to the strip club !
you &apos;ll have plenty of chances.there are thousands of women out there , just waiting to screw me over .
yeah , all right .
how was vermont ?
emily is ... incredible . there are no words to describe her .
the whole weekend was like a dream .
and you ! rach !
you were so right.what ?
what you said about us finally being in a place where we could really be happy for each other .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t quite there.the thought of you and that josh guy
joshua.joshua guy at that club , dancing , having a good time
and the thought of it kind of .... you know ? but now !
