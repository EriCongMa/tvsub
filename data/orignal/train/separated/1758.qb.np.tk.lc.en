i &apos;ve invented a science joke , would you like to hear it ?
sure .
how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
how many ?
who cares ? he stole the idea
and doesn &apos;t deserve his own joke .
is that really true ?
of course , that &apos;s how you know it &apos;s a good joke .
it not only entertains , it informs .
hey , sorry to interrupt .
uh , barry ,
uh , how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
did you know edison didn &apos;t actually invent the light bulb ?
what do you want , barry ?
just wanted to drop this off as a little thank you for amy .
what &apos;s this for ?
your idea really helped me out .
my light @-@ cone quantization paper &apos;s online already .
the response has been amazing .
well , that &apos;s fascinating .
i can &apos;t wait to read it .
oh , no , me as well .
uh , please e @-@ mail it to sheldon @ bazinga.biz.
why &quot; dot @-@ biz &quot; ?
because i just gave you the business .
and also bazinga.com was taken .
anyway , thanks again .
cooper , suck eggs .
since when do you help out barry kripke ?
well , i &apos;d been thinking about a cellular automata approach
to neuronal connectivity ,
and i thought it might have some interesting applications
to string theory-- it &apos;s not a big deal .
oh , really ?
when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end ,
why didn &apos;t you try to help me ?
i did-- you said the only math biologists know is
if you have three frogs and one hops away ,
that leaves two frogs .
that &apos;s pretty funny , that does sound like me .
but that doesn &apos;t mean
that you should be standing on street corners
handing out your math to whatever guy comes along .
sheldon , we &apos;re all scientists .
i helped out a fellow colleague .
you &apos;re being petty .
i &apos;m being petty ?
you know barry and i have a professional rivalry .
you heard him-- he told me to suck eggs .
if we were friends , he would have suggested
i suck something more pleasant .
why are you laughing ?
did you learn something ?
okay , ma .
say hi to aunt gladys .
yeah , i love you , too .
bye .
your mom having fun in florida ?
mmm , she loves it .
she finally found a place where everyone talks about
how sweaty they are .
anyway , she wants us to go to the house
and check in on stuart because he might be &quot; lonely . &quot;
she &apos;s just being nice .
well , i &apos;m her son , how come she doesn &apos;t send someone
to check on me if i &apos;m lonely ?
because you have a wife .
yeah , well , sometimes you work late .
i know you don &apos;t like stuart being in the house ,
but the store &apos;s about to reopen ,
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll get back on his feet .
that would be great .
i &apos;d love for things between me and mom to get back to normal .
well , normal &apos;s a strong word , but sure .
hey .
hello .
you okay ?
if i was okay , i would &apos;ve said &quot; hello &quot;
and not the much more ominous &quot; hello . &quot;
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m mad at amy .
did she leave pit stains in your favorite crop top , too ?
no .
she helped barry kripke make an advancement in string theory .
oh , that sounds like a good thing .
well , it would be , except that i left string theory
because i decided it was a dead end .
yeah , and then she went behind my back
to help someone else prove me wrong .
my rival , no less .
i &apos;m sorry you had to see that .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t have a camera .
why would she do this to me ?
well , i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t upset you on purpose .
besides , aren &apos;t you the one who says
there &apos;s nothing more important than the advancement of science ?
no , i said there &apos;s nothing more important
than me advancing science .
all right , well , if i &apos;m understanding this right ,
and all she did was help out another scientist ,
i &apos;m thinking you might have to let this one go .
ugh , &quot; let it go . &quot;
i have heard that my whole life .
every time something upsets me somebody says , &quot; let it go , &quot;
you know , like it &apos;s my fault ,
and it &apos;s not okay to feel the way i feel .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
i mean , why don &apos;t you talk to her ?
is that all you have ?
shopworn tidbits like &quot; talk to her &quot; and &quot; let it go &quot; ?
gee , penny , life &apos;s giving me lemons .
what should i do ?
well , you could shove them somewhere .
okay , now you &apos;re getting creative .
thanks again for your help .
no problem .
our pleasure .
the place really looks great .
yeah , you should have burned it down years ago .
i keep telling you i didn &apos;t burn it down .
we know , we know-- because burning something down
for the insurance money is a &quot; crime . &quot;
stuart , this place looks amazing .
thanks .
you really did a nice job .
and thank you for putting up with me
staying at your mom &apos;s through all this .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t have done it otherwise .
i appreciate that , and i &apos;m glad you were able to ...
is that my mother &apos;s furniture ?
yeah , she said i could use it .
doesn &apos;t it look great ?
not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs .
howie .
why don &apos;t you just clean out the whole room ?
take the string art clown i made her in third grade
and the ribbon i got in swim class
for putting my face in the water .
what is your problem ?
she said it was okay .
well , i &apos;m her son , and i say it &apos;s not okay .
some son-- looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art .
well , maybe i should &apos;ve gone to a fancy art school like you .
then i could run a failed comic shop
and mooch off some guy &apos;s mother .
why don &apos;t we leave so you can cool off ?
i think that &apos;s a good idea .
take him out of my store .
your store ? !
my mother gave you the money to reopen .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
why don &apos;t we go get the food for the party .
thank you .
smart-- looks like we &apos;re being helpful .
mmm , when really we &apos;re just exiting an uncomfortable situation .
kripke , you know , of all the people-- barry kripke .
i &apos;m so ... are you folding it like a crazy person
to get me to do it for you ? !
no .
oh , give me that .
just out of curiosity ,
if i were to let something go ,
how would i do that ?
i don &apos;t know-- just think about something else .
can i think about the spiny anteater ?
sure .
the spiny anteater ...
never went behind my back and worked with barry kripke .
that didn &apos;t help at all .
you know , some people try visualization .
how does that work ?
okay ,
imagine your problems are a pen .
okay .
now imagine you &apos;re holding that pen .
okay .
now open your hand and let it go .
but i just got this pen .
it &apos;s got my initials on it and everything .
look .
sheldon , this isn &apos;t that hard .
i may have a better way that you can teach me .
how ?
what if i told you that over the past few months
amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles
to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab ?
what ? she didn &apos;t give me any puzzles .
are you sure ?
boy , i just can &apos;t seem to get these scissors back together .
can you do it ?
darn it .
there &apos;s something in my eye ,
and i need to sort these coins by size .
can you help ?
penny ?
i really want to eat this banana ,
but it &apos;s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box .
son of a bitch !
okay , that &apos;s great .
now , let it go .
i can &apos;t believe you were testing me against a chimp !
well , excuse me , amy was testing you .
i was rooting for you .
good job on that banana box , by the way .
why would she even do this ?
she &apos;s been conducting an experiment on apes
where they &apos;re given various puzzles to solve .
i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles
and thought some humans wouldn &apos;t be able to solve them .
that &apos;s when amy said , &quot; want to make this interesting ? &quot;
&quot; make this interesting &quot; ?
you bet money on me ?
no , no .
we designed an experiment involving you .
see ? now , isn &apos;t that interesting ?
it &apos;s not interesting .
it &apos;s incredibly insulting .
okay , maybe this will help--
imagine you &apos;re holding a pen .
before you go too far , not a special pen
with your initials engraved on it--
that &apos;ll make the next part really hard .
that &apos;s it .
get out !
i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re mad at me .
you should be mad at amy .
like i was this afternoon .
hey , look at that-- i let it go .
get out !
penny ?
what ?
i think i left my pen in there .
i understand why you &apos;re upset ,
but he worked really hard to get the store ready .
and it &apos;s just furniture .
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s furniture .
it belongs in the house i grew up in--
next to that pile of tv guides
and in plain view of what , for a ten @-@ year @-@ old ,
was a quality piece of string art !
howie , if the store succeeds ,
stuart has a source of income ,
and he can move out of your mother &apos;s house .
seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price
to pay for that .
that is a good point .
but i didn &apos;t marry you for good points .
i married you to blindly support me
no matter how ridiculous i &apos;m being !
this is why i had to rewrite our wedding vows .
hi , we &apos;re here to pick up an order for comic center .
sure , let me go check on that .
dude , i @-@ i think that &apos;s nathan fillion .
oh yeah , look at that .
and he &apos;s picking the tomatoes out of his salad
just like i do .
i always did feel a connection with him .
oh , i have got an idea .
we &apos;re not selling his tomatoes on ebay .
no , if we got captain reynolds from firefly
to do a signing at stuart &apos;s store ,
that would be amazing .
that would be great .
so should we go talk to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , if he &apos;s not nice , it &apos;s gonna make it hard for me
to watch him in anything again .
what ? !
the @-@ the guy who plays jon snow was a jerk .
we still watch game of thrones .
he was a jerk because you rear @-@ ended him .
i was distracted .
it &apos;s weird seeing a member of the night &apos;s watch
with a kayak strapped to his car .
come on .
hi , excuse me , s @-@ s ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t mean to bother you ,
but we &apos;re just really big fans of firefly .
a @-@ and dr. horrible .
oh , uh , i think you made a mistake .
i &apos;m not an actor .
don &apos;t say that .
i mean , you &apos;re not dame judi dench ,
but you &apos;re pretty great .
oh , yeah , i get it-- you think i &apos;m nathan fillion ,
but i &apos;m not .
so if you don &apos;t mind , i would just love to eat my lunch .
come on .
sorry to bother you .
don &apos;t know why he &apos;s so grumpy .
i got mistaken for that guy in life of pi once ,
and i &apos;m still floating .
sheldon , it &apos;s me .
oh , hey .
d @-@ did you see that ?
i @-@ i figured out how to open the door all by myself .
maybe i &apos;ll fling some feces around my cage to celebrate .
what are you talking about ?
i know you &apos;ve been giving me secret puzzle tests .
sheldon , open the door .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m naked .
i just saw you .
hang on .
open the door now .
pull up your pants !
it &apos;s not a big deal .
i run tests like this on undergrads all the time .
if you fill out some paperwork at the university ,
i can get you $ 5 .
i don &apos;t want $ 5 .
i want my dignity .
so what are we talking , like , ten bucks ?
thank you .
thanks .
sorry again .
no problem .
a @-@ are you sure you &apos;re not him ?
uh , you can tell us .
we &apos;re scientists , not crazy fanboys .
all right , fine .
i &apos;m him .
and you &apos;re eating alone at a deli .
i don &apos;t buy it-- you &apos;re not him .
i just wanted to eat my lunch in peace .
but i really am him .
and thank you very much for being a fan .
if you want , uh , let &apos;s take a picture .
that would be great .
great .
yeah , thank you .
you bet .
wait , hang on .
if you &apos;re really nathan fillion ,
what &apos;s the line from firefly about your bonnet ?
&quot; i swear by my pretty floral bonnet , i will end you . &quot;
that &apos;s it , that &apos;s the line .
although ...
i knew the line-- doesn &apos;t make me nathan fillion .
do you want the picture or not ?
i want a picture with nathan fillion .
how about a picture with a guy who looks like nathan fillion
but a little more annoyed than nathan fillion usually is ?
what do you think ?
eh , it &apos;s good enough for facebook .
i can &apos;t believe they did that .
i know-- it &apos;s so insulting .
at one point , they had me figure out
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box .
wait , sheldon gave me a banana in a box .
he was testing me , too .
unbelievable .
and how could a chimp even solve that ?
that was impossible .
really ? you couldn &apos;t get it out ?
thank you .
wow , the store looks great .
so you guys were testing us both ?
what is the matter with you ?
eh , what &apos;s the matter with them is
they think they &apos;re so smart they don &apos;t care
if they hurt other people &apos;s feelings .
sounds like us .
that &apos;s not true .
i still don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re upset .
you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps .
well , except barnabas , but he was on adderall .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s making me crazy .
can you please just let it go ?
oh , i can help you with that .
imagine you &apos;re holding an ordinary pen .
while your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket .
hold that thought .
hello ?
how can i make this up to you ?
the answer &apos;s in this puzzle box .
let &apos;s see if you can open it .
you could have at least warned him about the furniture .
that &apos;s what i said when we moved it .
you helped him ? !
no , stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own .
hey , you okay ?
uh , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my mom died .
what ?
that was my aunt .
ma took a nap .
she never woke up .
oh , my god , howie .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what can we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
may i say something ?
not right now , sheldon .
but i think it would be comforting .
buddy ...
no , it &apos;s okay .
what ?
when i lost my own father ,
i didn &apos;t have any friends to help me through it .
you do .
i really thought he was gonna say , &quot; let it go . &quot;
okay , thanks , bernadette .
travel safe .
okay , bye .
they booked a flight .
they &apos;re heading to the airport now .
how &apos;s howard holding up ?
he &apos;s hanging in there .
how are you doing , stuart ?
still can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
i mean , that woman took me in .
if it wasn &apos;t for her , i @-@ i would have been homeless .
one of us would have taken you in .
yeah , i don &apos;t recall any offers .
but , you know , uh , i @-@ i &apos;m glad it worked out the way it did
because i got to know this wonderful person .
yeah .
mrs. wolowitz was pretty special .
when i first moved to america ,
howard was my only friend .
she made me feel so welcome in her home .
which says a lot , because , those first few years ,
she thought i was the gardener .
whenever i saw her ,
she &apos;d say i was too skinny and try and feed me .
she did that to me , too .
don &apos;t take this away from me .
i didn &apos;t care for her yelling .
but now that i &apos;m not going to hear it again ,
i &apos;m sad .
if you want , i can yell at you later .
it won &apos;t be as good .
let &apos;s have a toast .
to mrs. wolowitz .
a loving mother ...
... to all of us .
we &apos;ll miss you .
