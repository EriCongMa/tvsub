第二十四季第一集
爷就是来抢的
this is kent brockman
at the 1st annual springfield grand prix ,
which , like all our town showcase events ,
is not only poorly planned , it &apos;s horribly executed .
the making of the empire state building ,
part one : the basement .
wait for the gap ...
wait for the gap .
homer , we can buy scotch tape tomorrow .
there &apos;s the gap !
gap &apos;s too small !
a peloton ?
apparently , today is also the final stage
of the tour de springfield bike race .
hey , that &apos;s some fancy riding .
种族主义舞会在街上举办
truthfully , today , there were no losers and no winners
since both finish lines were tangled up in this unholy mess .
i hear tapping from inside .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
well , uh , let &apos;s , uh , all start tapping our toes
to the sounds of scab calloway
and his non @-@ union band .
uh , keep it down in there .
so , is this a &quot; date &quot; date
or just a meaningless friend thing ?
meaningless friend thing .
true love super date !
well , if you two ever get serious and have a baby ,
it &apos;ll look something like this .
don &apos;t listen to uncle bart.
lisa and i will raise you in a house of love .
we &apos;re not having a baby .
jimmy !
oh , brother .
let &apos;s dance .
geek leak !
hey , bart , at least i &apos;ve got a date .
dance with me , please .
i need to zing my sister .
okay , but you have to do your homework .
just kidding .
i &apos;ve given up on that .
just move your girdle , yertle .
hey , lisa , your dance partner
just made the cover dorks illustrated magazine .
i know that &apos;s a zing , but still ...
the cover !
now , you listen to me , bart.
milhouse may not be the perfect date .
please let there be a &quot; but &quot; coming , please !
but ...
landed it !
at least i &apos;m with someone who tries a little too hard
because he really likes me .
hey , plenty of babes have docked in porta de barto .
yeah , for about a week .
but as soon as they get to know the real you ,
they departo de barto .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re alone tonight .
oh my god , is that true ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid lisa &apos;s right , son .
if the late , great
nora ephron taught us anything , it &apos;s ...
oh ! what &apos;s my other inflatable doll doing here ?
what ? what ?
i ain &apos;t here with no one .
oh , man , lisa &apos;s right .
none of these relationships lasted very long .
three days .
one recess .
half a field trip .
why did i have to get so needy at the planetarium ?
boy , if anyone needs me ,
i &apos;ll be taking a popcorn bath .
it &apos;s a thing i read about in a men &apos;s health magazine
in a dream .
dad , can i ask you a question ?
how did you ever get a woman like mom to stay with you ?
look in the mirror , unplanned miracle .
is that the only reason ?
well , i also keep things interesting .
all right , who took the microwave ?
you see ?
hey , what are you looking at ?
my ex @-@ girlfriends .
aw , boy , i feel for you .
nobody likes to be rejected
and it never gets easier , until you can drink .
because then you can express your unfiltered feelings
by drunk dialing .
observe .
hey , it &apos;s me again .
he &apos;s there , isn &apos;t he ?
well , i hope this doesn &apos;t sound weird ,
but i &apos;m inside your closet .
um , that &apos;s awesome , but i think i &apos;ll visit my ex @-@ girlfriends
and prove they still like me .
it &apos;s me .
i was thinking about you .
it &apos;s your birthday in like , three , four months ?
would it be weird if i threw you a party ?
eat my shorts !
drop dead .
eat fist , jerk .
you &apos;ve got a lot of nerve showing up here ...
and not giving me a kiss .
inappropriate !
i miss you .
stalker !
save me .
mary spuckler ,
you &apos;re my last chance .
she &apos;s pretty cute for cletus &apos;s daughter .
yeah , she liked to drink milk
as a kid instead of white paint .
is you one of my kids ?
no , sir .
prove it .
a , b , c ...
all right . all right .
you convinced me , einstein .
what you want ?
is mary here ?
i &apos;m afraid mary done run off .
we knows not where .
dadgummit .
do you think she still likes me ?
um , hey , brandine !
does mary still like this boy ?
i don &apos;t know what that girl likes anymore .
she ran away after we engaged her
to old man wellbottom .
and i was gonna be a good husband , too !
if &apos;n i ever get out of this well .
all right . all right now .
that &apos;s enough out of you .
but i just--
oh , i can &apos;t believe she ran away .
and this isn &apos;t helping .
i better switch to the hard stuff .
hey , dubya .
i know where my sister run off to .
new york city .
new york ?
that &apos;s where sesame street is .
do you ever wonder what happens to oscar on garbage day ?
yup , new york .
the big something .
this here &apos;s her address .
good luck !
i don &apos;t know if we should be up here , bart simpson .
and why is that ?
&apos;cause the floor ain &apos;t finished .
daddy just covers things with hay and says they &apos;re done .
mom , can we go to new york
to find this girl i used to know ?
bart , that &apos;s sweet ,
but we &apos;d need airplane money , hotel money ...
and $ 500 for yankee tickets ,
which turn out to be bogus .
well , don &apos;t buy &apos; em .
but they &apos;re playing the purple sox .
come on , dad , you love new york .
now , that your two least favorite buildings
have been obliterated : old penn station and shea stadium .
lousy , outdated relics !
boy , do you remember what happened
the last time we went to new york ?
keep your meat hooks off my sister marge or my goons
will do a soft show on your solar plexus .
you &apos;re dead , j.j. get yourself buried .
tough cookie , huh , well , watch me take a bite out of ya .
i &apos;m about to go out shooting and you just said who .
that &apos;s some lip you got on you .
how &apos;d you like me to stretch it like a rubber band
and snap you into last week ?
you &apos;re selling milk , j.j. , and i got a sour stomach .
homer , that sounds like the sweet smell of success .
it didn &apos;t feel like success .
why , ladies ? why ? !
son , you can dial down the crazy .
your mother and i talked about it ,
and we found a way to get to new york .
it &apos;s all set , boy .
to save money , we &apos;re swapping houses .
but don &apos;t the people wreck your house when they stay in it ?
i didn &apos;t say i swapped our house .
yeah , how ya doing ?
we &apos;re staying here for two weeks .
lord , you &apos;re testing me , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah , keep talking to your friend up there .
we &apos;ll be doing it on your bed .
new york style .
look at this place .
things have certainly changed
since our ancestor fievel came here .
fievel was a mouse in a movie .
yes , and now look at us .
only in america .
khlav kalash ! get your khlav kalash !
oh , geez , not this guy with his stupid little pushcart .
50,000 square feet , huh ? all khlav kalash !
used to be bookstore .
books .
come on , let &apos;s go find mary .
this is the address her brother gave me .
can &apos;t dad take bart while we seek out culture ?
you do that .
you know you &apos;re missing your clothes ?
i thought this was just a dream .
oh , man !
all right , i &apos;ll spring for a cab .
much better .
here we are .
anything you leave in a cab you &apos;ll never see again .
oh , uh , oh , thank god you woke up .
oh , i guess my search for true love is doomed .
you &apos;ve learned a very valuable life lesson , boy .
which is that love doesn &apos;t exist ,
except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage .
after that , it &apos;s just hanging out with someone who kind of
hates you but you can &apos;t get it together to leave .
i &apos;ll get us some ice cream .
what &apos;s the matter , darling ?
thanks for asking , duchess .
i &apos;m sitting here waiting for a girl that &apos;s never gonna show up .
what makes you so sure ?
girls don &apos;t like me .
i don &apos;t really like them yet either , but i think i &apos;m gonna .
there &apos;s a storm a @-@ brewing down there .
well , there &apos;s a girl a @-@ standin &apos; right here .
it &apos;s me , mary .
wow , what are you doing for money ?
well , it &apos;s not very steady and i &apos;m kind of ashamed .
i &apos;m a featured player on saturday night live .
mary spuckler !
aw , i &apos;m lying .
my whole life here is a bunch of lies .
i &apos;m just a writer with a performing option .
let &apos;s talk about something else .
something nice .
故事还在继续 阿巴乐队的曲子有的是
so , this is basically what we can afford .
okay , second balcony , partially obstructed view ,
no bathroom privileges and you must stipulate that ,
in emergencies , you can change a spotlight shell .
well , at least i &apos;ll be able to say i went to a broadway show .
you &apos;re not allowed to say that .
oh , forget it .
so , bart simpson , did you really come
all the way here just to see me ?
yeah .
plus , i thought i might get
to see an air conditioner fall on someone &apos;s head .
but i guess that never really ...
ow ! what was that ? ! is that your father ?
bart , i want to see you again ,
but i don &apos;t want a grownup taking me back .
meet me at the high line tomorrow .
keep my secret !
you little !
where &apos;s that ice cream ? !
just once , i &apos;d like your father
to be on a jumbotron for something good .
damn you and your fluted neck !
so , what did you do with your dad ?
we &apos;re safe because you have to climb steps to get up here .
can &apos;t move ?
no .
i thought there was no crime in new york anymore .
giuliani !
gimme some news of springfield .
they let sideshow bob out of prison again .
huh , didn &apos;t know they still ran those trains .
how &apos;s your momma and your sister ?
trying to find high culture at low prices .
no , lisa !
if you click that turnstile , it &apos;ll blow our budget !
well , without them around ,
you and i can walk through the city holding hands ,
just like the menfolk do .
i could listen to your twang all day .
would you care to hear it in song ?
&apos;cause i wrote one &apos; bout you .
can i do a rap in the middle of it ?
or you could just listen .
sir , may i borrow your guitar ?
sure , sure . it &apos;s the case that make money .
* a boy i knew turned up again *
* kind of liked him way back when *
* chased him round the livestock bend ... *
* rolling on my skateboard , *
* pimping like a drug lord ... *
* well i &apos;m on the cusp of womanhood *
* and i like a boy *
* that ain &apos;t no good at nothin &apos; *
* &apos; cept making me smile *

i &apos;ve come to take you back , mary .
daddy ?
sorry , honey , your mother misses you
but she just can &apos;t say it .
that &apos;s cause the donkey busted her jaw .
she &apos;ll be fine .
your mother too .
all right , broadway &apos;s too expensive ,
the museums are over @-@ curated ,
but shakespeare in the park is tonight
and the tickets are free .
get your cuckold &apos;s horns , neck ruffles , yorik skulls !
i &apos;ll take a cuckold &apos;s horn !
it works !
ladies and gentlemen , i have an announcement .
lad @-@ ies and gen @-@ tle @-@ men , i have an an @-@ nounce @-@ ment--
that &apos;s not iambic pentameter !
i &apos;m afraid that tonight &apos;s show has been cancelled .
huh ? why ? wherefore ?
the baldwin brothers , who were , uh , playing the monague family
and the sheen / estevez clan ,
our capulets , have quit the production .
you guys suck at acting and you ate all the potato salad .
no , you suck at acting and it &apos;s first come , first serve !
i made that potato salad !
well , uh , idiot , it says zaybar &apos;s on the package !
he works at zaybar &apos;s .
we all work at zaybar &apos;s .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you came to see romeo and juliet ,
not feuding families .
uh , the long , slow line to leave the theatre forms on the left .
aw , and we have to walk by a drum circle !
faster , man ! more annoying !
not so fast !
we came for shakespeare and we &apos;re gonna see shakespeare .
anyone who wants to be in this ,
grab a doublet and meet me backstage !
is there , mayhaps , a bit of business for me ?
i was thinking amateurs only .
well , my only professional job was playing
a nefarious hot dog in an ad for taco bueno .
you fresh @-@ made tacos will never
defeat pre @-@ boiled hot dogs !
please , i owe yale drama school $ 200,000 .
they keep calling my mother .
fine ! you &apos;re in .
i must warn you , i have crippling stage fright .
oh , for the love of god !
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo .
our search for culture is thus concluded ,
for the bard of avon is well suited
to a crowd with every cell phone muted .
geez , i can &apos;t stop talking like this .
hey , don &apos;t ever stop !
because , tonight , we made it in new york .
those the people who took over the theatre ?
pepper spray and power wash--
the new york hug and kiss .
nbc网络
now , mary , you listen to me .
i &apos;m one @-@ third your father and you &apos;re gonna come back .
if y &apos;all will excuse me ,
i gotta freshen up for the ride home .
enjoy your fancy @-@ schmancy in @-@ house for the last time .
um , i &apos;ve got to go .
go where ?
uh , well , since we &apos;re here ,
i &apos;m gonna go try to get al roker &apos;s autograph .
here you go , little fan .
killer storm on the way .
um , i gonna go try to sell this .
i &apos;ll buy it back .
goodbye , bart , and don &apos;t worry ,
there &apos;ll be other mary spucklers ,
including my sisters mary zeke
and mary not quite right .
bart , if any girl tries to fix you ,
let &apos; em ,
because you got a couple of big problems .
but mostly , you &apos;re great !
boy , you tell me where mary &apos;s gone !
i can &apos;t .
boy , you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man .
i can &apos;t because mary &apos;s the girl
that proves that girls can like me .
and she wouldn &apos;t like me anymore if i gave her up .
so i won &apos;t , even if you torture me
like you do the english language .
well , if that ain &apos;t aren &apos;t the isn &apos;t .
i guess i just gotta let mary find her own way .
come on , let &apos;s head on back to springfield .
uh , one on @-@ getter for the clickity clack , please .
you miss her , don &apos;t you , son ?
you want a picture of her for your wallet ?
oh , she &apos;s somewhere in b @-@ 3 .
thanks , man .
aw , look at that .
my little guy &apos;s finally realizing
how complicated grownup feelings can be .
well , at least it didn &apos;t end as bad as romeo and juliet .
no kidding .
i saw your reviews .
吟游诗人之死
i specifically said , no critics !
this is outrageous !
ooh , but they like .
i hope you enjoyed the show tonight .
and if you &apos;re worried about when the air conditioner
fell on my head , rest assured it was a stunt man ,
and his family is being well taken care of .
but we &apos;re here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag .
the best submission will be animated and appear on the show .
do we screw them on the credit ?
no ! for details , log on to thesimpsons.com.
