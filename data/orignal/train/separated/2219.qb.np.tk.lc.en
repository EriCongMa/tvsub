you &apos;re still going to justin &apos;s thing tonight , right ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll probably get there around 11 : 00 .
depends on how much wine mr. and mrs. hiller drink
at dinner tonight .
can &apos;t believe you get paid 15 bucks an hour
to sit on your ass all night .
well , occasionally the baby cries ,
and i have to go check on her .
but , yeah , i , uh , pretty much just watch netflix .
whatever .
so let me ask you something ,
does this outfit look too trashy for tonight ?
well , on , like , a scale of from taylor to miley ,
you &apos;re , um ...
you &apos;re at a kardashian level of trashiness right now .
which one ?
does it matter ?
i &apos;m gonna change .
text me when you &apos;re done .
okay .
lates .
thanks .
thank you .
keep the change .
oh , that was fun .
oh , yeah .
night &apos;s not over .
ooh , save it for the bedroom , cowboy .
or ...
or what ?
well , we still have the sitter for a half hour .
thought we &apos;d give the hammock in the backyard a try .
oh , please .
i am not taking you to the emergency room
for a sex @-@ related injury .
all right .
open the door .
addison ?
mr. and mrs. hiller .
don &apos;t be alarmed , i &apos;m with sts security .
i was dispatched to check on an alarm incident .
why are you holding my baby ?
she was crying .
no one else was home .
i don &apos;t understand , if the alarm went off ,
why didn &apos;t anybody call us ?
‭ oh , my god !
please don &apos;t do this .
please .
for thousands of years ,
man has taken to the sea ,
building vessels to conquer the mighty ocean .
now , after nearly a year of planning ,
months of robust pre @-@ sale ,
finally time for my inaugural voyage
of my latest and greatest enterprise :
kamekona inter @-@ island booze cruise .
congratulations , big guy .
we knew you could do it .
well , not to be a killjoy ,
but as ship medic ,
i do have to advise that
consuming alcohol could severely impair
our ability to operate this vessel safely .
well , as the first mate @-@ slash @-@ dj @-@ slash bartender ,
i got one thing to say to that :
overruled .
boom .
i &apos;d like to throw out a special thank you
to my bruddah from another mudda ,
steve mcgarrett ,
for generously offering his services
as nautical consultant for this test run .
pro bono , i might add .
yeah , we , uh , we firmly established that i won &apos;t be getting paid ,
so why don &apos;t we christen this lady ,
and get her out on the water ?
i &apos;ll drink to that .
although i do have to admit i am perplexed
by the name that kamekona has chosen for her .
i didn &apos;t pick it , doc .
this boat is from a hpd property forfeiture auction .
re @-@ painting wasn &apos;t in the budget .
not after he blew it all on this .
yeah , that &apos;s impressive .
cuz is a straight @-@ up wizard
when it comes to branding .
all right , all right , let &apos;s make this official .
mcgarrett , want to do the honors ?
really ?
what , you couldn &apos;t spring for a bigger bottle ?
it &apos;s a ceremonial gesture .
ceremonial , okay .
to the sea , to the sailors of old ,
and to the ss thong magnet .
mazel tov .
mcgarrett .
oh , no .
chin , what do you got ?
joel and susan hiller .
housekeeper arrived this morning
and found them tied up on the floor .
their infant daughter , however , was left untouched in her crib .
i thought this was a kidnapping .
if the parents are accounted for and so is the kid ,
who &apos;s the victim ?
addison wells . 22 years old ,
originally from minnesota .
she &apos;s currently a senior at oahu state .
she started babysitting for the hillers six months ago .
parents are getting on a flight to hawaii .
minneapolis pd is up on the phones ,
but so far no ransom call .
well , i think if they wanted a ransom ,
they would &apos;ve taken the kid .
i agree , the hillers have deep pockets .
but the kidnapper was interested in addison , not a payday .
okay , putting motive aside for a minute ,
why did he abduct her from here ?
that &apos;s a good point .
seems risky .
well , addison lived on campus
and the access to the dorms is tightly controlled .
so grabbing her here may have been his best opportunity .
right , it also means he was stalking her long enough
to know her schedule , right ?
yeah .
csu ran diagnostics on the hiller security system .
the alarm was disabled from a remote location
just prior to the abduction .
kidnapper must have hacked it .
that takes considerable skill .
well , skills he &apos;s got .
he hacked the entire house .
everything connected with the home &apos;s network ,
from the thermostat ,
to the baby monitor , the security cameras ,
even that laptop that belongs to the vic .
all right , get this computer to jerry .
let &apos;s sit the hillers down with an hpd sketch artist .
if our perp went to this much trouble to abduct addison ,
i hate to think what he &apos;s gonna do to her .
were you two close ?
yeah , i &apos;d say so .
was she seeing anybody maybe ?
does she have a boyfriend ?
no , there was this guy she met online ,
but that didn &apos;t pan out .
why ? what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
they never actually met face to face .
they e @-@ mailed back and forth for , like , a month ,
and then it just suddenly ended .
how come ? did she say ?
no , i asked .
she clearly didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
but i think the guy really creeped her out .
do you recall if she ever mentioned this guy &apos;s name ?
jeremy .
meet jeremy f.
his online dating profile showed up on addison &apos;s browser history .
i also found a trove of deleted e @-@ mails between the two of them
going back over a month .
just scanning through them ,
i &apos;d say their correspondence could best be described as ,
well , &quot; intimate . &quot;
yeah , one problem .
this photo doesn &apos;t look anything like the composite sketch
we got on our perp .
there &apos;s a pretty good reason for that .
knowing that many people often misrepresent themselves
on the internet ,
i did a reverse image search ,
and the photos were stolen from this guy .
he is a collegiate rugby player
from melbourne , australia .
his favorite movie is the shawshank redemption ,
and his social media profile is set to public ,
which means that anyone in the world
can download these images .
okay , so jeremy f took this guy &apos;s photos
to catfish our victim .
exactly .
and once addison realized this ,
she sent him a strongly worded e @-@ mail ,
threatened to call the cops
if he ever tried to contact her again ,
and that &apos;s where the correspondence ended .
and i &apos;ll just bet this creeper
couldn &apos;t take no for an answer .
so he started stalking this poor woman
until he could find the perfect opportunity to grab her .
okay , jerry , we &apos;re gonna need to trace these e @-@ mails .
i hear you , but our kidnapper is no amateur .
he was smart enough to send the e @-@ mails
through a secure socket tunneling protocol .
csu &apos;s working to break the encryption ,
but it &apos;s gonna take time .
jerry , that &apos;s time we don &apos;t have .
come on , i mean , this girl &apos;s life is at stake .
well , unless you know of some computer genius
who can do the work of an entire crime lab in half the time ,
we &apos;re out of luck .
actually , i know just the guy .
here &apos;s your sunrise cocktail , sir .
thank you .
oh , please , god ,
if you exist , prove it to me right here and now .
thank you .
hi , excuse me , um ,
is that you on the cover of that magazine ?
oh , boy , that &apos;s so embarrassing .
my publicist insisted that i do it .
my name &apos;s adam .
my friends call me toast .
mia .
i should probably know who you are .
not unless you &apos;re a gamer .
yeah , i created one of the fastest grossing
mobile games of all time .
we hit ten million downloads in the first month .
oh , wow , that &apos;s incredible .
that &apos;s what tim cook said .
but enough about me ,
what is it that you do ?
um , i &apos;m a model .
i was just in lanai doing a swimwear shoot .
swimwear , very cool .
so , what brings you to los angeles today , toast ?
waffles .
what ?
well , not just waffles , fried chicken too .
have you ever been to roscoe &apos;s in hollywood ?
uh , yeah , sure . it &apos;s great .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d travel 3,000 miles for it .
yeah , well ,
clearly you &apos;re not as dedicated to excellent waffles as i am .
but if you &apos;re free later , i &apos;d love to take you to breakfast .
you do know we land at 5 : 00 , right ?
i don &apos;t do time zones .
i do , however ,
very much enjoy a good breakfast ,
hence the name .
you &apos;re funny .
and you &apos;re mind @-@ blowingly attractive .
you &apos;re gonna just pretend like you didn &apos;t see us or what ?
jersey . mcgruff .
what a coincidence .
you guys going to la ?
no .
no , and neither are you .
impeccable timing as always , fellas .
thanks to you , i am not having chicken and waffles
with a bona fide ten .
hold on , hold on .
stop . you ?
you created poopie penguin ?
yeah .
unbelievable .
what &apos;s poopie penguin ?
that &apos;s right .
what &apos;s poopie penguin ?
what &apos;s poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock ?
poopie penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone
where you &apos;re a penguin , and you &apos;re flying around in the air ,
and you poop on people &apos;s heads for points .
penguins don &apos;t fly .
no .
they do in my universe .
let me explain something to you ,
my kids , charlie and grace , they play this game non @-@ stop .
must have spent $ 100 on it just last month .
yeah , that &apos;s the beauty of in @-@ app purchases .
yeah , i don &apos;t think there is anything beautiful about it .
i think that it is a scam .
you &apos;re ripping off children is what you &apos;re doing .
i mean , you give them the app for free ,
and then they got to pay if they want to keep playing
for the power @-@ ups and the boosts or whatever you call it .
you &apos;re like a drug dealer pushing dope .
first taste is free . then they &apos;re hooked for life .
don &apos;t hate the player , hate the game .
i hate the game . i do very much .
would you please stop and let him focus ?
he needs to focus . this is important .
i &apos;m just curious ,
how do you think of something like that anyway ?
ah , simple .
a , poop is funny .
i &apos;ll give you that .
b , it &apos;s relatable , everybody poops .
and c , it &apos;s easy to monetize .
i mean , biology tells us that in order to poop ,
you have to eat , and i control the food supply .
all right with the biology , okay ?
you sell 99 cent virtual penguin food , all right ?
get over yourself .
winner , winner ,
chicken @-@ waffle dinner .
you got a location ?
i do .
it looks like those catfish e @-@ mails were sent
from an office building downtown .
toast , talk to me .
keep going about ten more yards , and then head right .
signal &apos;s tracing to a terminal in the far corner .
can i help you ?
you got a beautiful family , mr. mintz .
i imagine they &apos;re not gonna be too pleased
when they find out that their old man
is an online predator .
please , you have to understand ,
i &apos;m not a bad person .
okay .
look , addison wells found out who you really were ,
and then all of a sudden she @-@ she ends up missing .
h @-@ how do you explain that ?
now , look , i admit that i misrepresented myself to addison ,
but i had nothing to do with her disappearance .
it was all just a fantasy .
i never planned on acting on it .
chin showed mintz &apos;s photo to the hillers .
they don &apos;t seem to think he &apos;s our guy .
i &apos;m not surprised . look at this .
mintz was perving on at least a dozen other women ,
and he was actually at this terminal
chatting one of them up last night .
he logged off around 11 : 00 p.m.
okay . there &apos;s no way
he could &apos;ve been in kahala at the time of the abduction .
i am begging you .
i won &apos;t tell anybody .
please . let me go .
i don &apos;t want to die here .
please .
please let me go .
toast just did a sweep of addison &apos;s laptop .
found something the crime lab missed .
spyware .
and she had it bad .
i &apos;m not talking about the kind that slows your computer down ,
and gives you pop @-@ up ads for boner pills .
i &apos;m talking about cherry bomb .
what &apos;s &quot; cherry bomb ? &quot;
it &apos;s like microsoft office for black hat hackers .
it &apos;s a suite of malware that includes key loggers ,
root kits , and fingerprint evasions
real scary stuff .
the thing is , we found
the executable file that infected addison &apos;s system .
it was installed over five months ago .
so the spyware landed on her computer
before she was catfished by mintz ,
which means that it had to be her kidnapper who infected her .
we find out who &apos;s behind the hack , we found our guy .
okay , guys ,
i don &apos;t know who attacked addison &apos;s computer ,
but i might know someone who does .
dude , what are you doing ?
just keeping it real .
i don &apos;t want the old crew thinking i sold out .
why do you think we parked two blocks away ?
i can &apos;t believe this .
we &apos;re sending scooby and shaggy in to work this lead .
password .
joshua .
nice .
joshua was the backdoor password that matthew broderick used
to access the cheyenne mountain nuclear complex
in the 1983 sci @-@ fi classic war games .
that &apos;s right .
your nerd credentials are in order , you may enter .
so , which one of these lovable rogues is our han solo ?
10 o &apos;clock .
in the bean bag chair .
he goes by null legend .
he authored cherry bomb .
well , look at this .
captain bird turd is slumming it with the code jockeys again .
what , did you blow through your millions already ?
nope .
i was hoping you could help my boy here .
see , someone &apos;s been using cherry bomb to creep on his sister .
sorry to hear ,
but i just give people the tools to hack ,
it &apos;s up to them to do so responsibly .
besides , my customers pay top dollar to stay anon .
except they &apos;re not so anonymous to you .
we both know that you keep records of all your buyers ,
so that way , if the heat does come down ,
you &apos;ve got someone to roll on .
let me be clear , okay ?
it &apos;s not that i can &apos;t help you , it &apos;s that i don &apos;t want to .
and i think you know why .
this is going great .
about as well as i expected .
okay , all right .
okay , it &apos;s obvious you two have some history ,
but can we just take a step back and focus on my problem ?
hold that thought , jerry .
patrick here was about to tell us how i stole his idea .
first of all ,
very uncool using my real name ,
and second , you did steal my idea .
here we go .
okay , remember ?
we were blasting a j in the zippie &apos;s parking lot
and a bird dropped a deuce right on my shoulder ,
and then we started talking
about how that would make a cool video game .
yeah , but in your version the player was just an average dude
who was trying to avoid getting pooped on .
it was my idea to make the player the pooper ,
not the poopee .
plus , when i brought it up to you a couple days later ,
you said , quote ,
&quot; that &apos;s the dumbest idea ever , &quot; enquote .
in my defense ,
i was sober when i said that .
okay , look , null legend , or patrick ,
whatever your name is ...
it &apos;s patrick .
patrick .
the customer you &apos;re protecting ,
the guy in this picture , he kidnapped a girl .
dude , your sister was kidnapped ?
no that was just a clever ruse .
i &apos;m actually with five @-@ 0 .
and all i got to do is say the word ,
and the cavalry will storm this place ,
seize every computer in here , and arrest your entire crew .
how many customers are gonna want to do business with you then ?
i can &apos;t believe you narc &apos;d me out .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still running linux
on a 32 @-@ bit samurai stack .
get out of the dark ages , dude .
also , get us that name .
yeah .
let &apos;s get hpd and csu down here ,
tear this place apart .
okay , so this place is leased to a guy named jacob holm .
neighbors have not seen him for at least a couple days .
well , it probably means addison was never here , right ?
okay , so this is what we know about jacob holm .
he worked in i.t. at a local law firm .
that was , until he was fired for downloading confidential files
off the company &apos;s server .
yeah , holm &apos;s bosses agreed to drop the charges
if he just returned the stolen data ,
but instead he turned around and leaked
hundreds of e @-@ mails to the press
proving that the law firm was wrapped up in all kinds of dirt .
they were destroying evidence , covering up fraud ,
even threatened witnesses .
when the story broke , the press branded holm a &quot; hacktivist . &quot;
he ended up serving 18 months of a five year sentence ,
and , uh , he was released last july .
where &apos;d you find all this stuff ?
folder in his nightstand .
ah , so he &apos;s proud of it . he thinks he &apos;s a hero ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i mean , holm &apos;s one prior arrest
was for a crime that was ideologically motivated .
all right , how does a guy go from hacking a law firm
to kidnapping a college kid ?
ahoy , captain !
ahoy .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t mean to be a backseat sailor ,
but just want to make sure everything &apos;s all right with the ship .
all good , bruddah . why you asking ?
well , it &apos;s just that , according to my calculations ,
it appears that we &apos;ve travelled approximately ten feet
in the last 40 minutes .
what ? how is that possible ?
it appears that our vessel is currently becalmed .
i would put the wind speed at a one on the beaufort scale .
english .
there is no wind ,
hence the boat isn &apos;t moving .
flippa !
flippa !
what gives , brah ?
you &apos;re supposed to be my gps .
sorry , cuz , i got seasick .
i see why our navigation system &apos;s on the fritz .
well , leaving your first mate in charge of the liquor
may not have been the most prudent move .
don &apos;t sweat it , doc .
i got an auxiliary engine just for this situation .
i assume you checked that the battery was charged
before we set sail .
this thing has a battery ?
mayday . mayday .
this is the ss thong magnet
needing emergency assistance .
and i &apos;m afraid the radio is powered by the battery as well .
and we lost cell service a few hours ago .
why are you so calm about this ?
well , i project outward confidence
as a way of coping with stress .
inside , i &apos;m terrified .
we &apos;re gonna die out here .
nobody &apos;s dying on my watch .
all we got to do is send a distress signal up .
coast guard will come and tow us to shore .
you got to be kidding me , brah .
must be a safety-- give it here .
sure , let the drunk guy handle the firearm .
great idea .
everyone chill , i got this .
well , there &apos;s no missing that .
i heard you got something .
yeah , addison wasn &apos;t the only person that holm was spying on .
looks like he put spyware onto over 1,000 machines .
he was targeting other victims .
exactly , and it looks like he may have selected one .
he &apos;s got a folder with this guy &apos;s name on it , jason putnam .
whoa , that &apos;s a lot of data .
over a terabyte .
e @-@ mails , financials , recorded phone calls ,
he even has video and screen caps
from a bunch of hijacked camera feeds .
who is jason putnam ?
my name is jason putnam ,
and i have something to confess .
over the past year ,
while working as a private financial advisor ,
i embezzled over $ 800,000 .
mostly from elderly clients
whom i believed were less likely to detect the fraud .
jason putnam posted this video to his profile three days ago
and it immediately went viral .
uh @-@ huh , so this guy &apos;s robbing old folks for their live savings .
i imagine the internet was not too kind .
it was brutal .
he was publically eviscerated .
but since then , no one has seen or heard from him .
his family contacted hpd
&apos;cause they were concerned about his mental state .
he &apos;s currently classified
as an &quot; endangered missing adult . &quot;
okay , but clearly putnam didn &apos;t go missing on his own .
i mean , holm kidnapped him and forced this confession .
guys , check this out .
found these on holm &apos;s server .
they &apos;re camera feeds and they &apos;re live .
all right , can we trace where they &apos;re coming from ?
yeah , sure , but there &apos;s 17 of them ,
and they &apos;re coming from all over the island .
from what i can tell , it &apos;s mostly abandoned buildings
and vacant homes .
well , obviously he was staking these places out .
maybe it &apos;s where he was planning on taking his victims .
that &apos;s what i was afraid of . check this out .
that &apos;s a body .
what is it ?
this is the fallout to his confession .
what do you think , he was making putnam watch it ?
that &apos;s exactly what i think .
and then he left him locked up in here
with only one way out .
thought we had lost you there , cuz .
get off me .
what happened ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
we were just floating out there on that life raft .
and i spotted land .
that &apos;s right .
you were so excited , you jumped up and lost your balance .
by the time we got you back in the raft ,
you had swallowed so much water , that you passed out .
doc had to do mouth to mouth to get you breathing again .
glad to see you back on your feet , captain .
where the hell are we ?
now , that is a good question .
my best bet is we &apos;re on one of the uninhabited islands
of the hawaiian chain .
most likely lehua .
lehua ?
now , all we have to do is survive until we get discovered .
fortunately , i had a have a head start on building the fire .
i did it while you were unconscious .
at least we &apos;ll be warm while we starve to death .
oh , nonsense .
i also collected some crickets and caterpillars
for our dining pleasure .
they &apos;re an excellent source of protein .
i grabbed what i could ...
before our ship burnt up .
if we ration it ,
could last us a few days .
talk to me , what do we have ?
mochi balls .
love those .
and a bottle of ouzo .
who &apos;s up for some sing @-@ a @-@ longs ?
that sounds delightful .
sorry , cuz .
if i die first ,
i want you to eat me .
nobody &apos;s gonna eat you .
so what are you saying , i &apos;m not good enough for you ?
why wouldn &apos;t you eat me ?
you are not a zombie ,
you &apos;re just eating me ...
it &apos;s not considered zombie @-@ ish ...
guys , over here !
check it out ,
doctor , regular macgyver .
actually , it &apos;s basic physics .
the lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn .
now all we need to do is stoke the flame .
i &apos;ll do you one better , brah .
it &apos;s always nice to have flammable material .
and alcohol .
all right , thanks , dude .
all right , so hpd checked all the locations
that holm was surveilling , no sign of addison .
okay , so this guy , he abducts addison for a specific reason ,
but it &apos;s not &apos; cause she &apos;s young and pretty .
no .
it &apos;s because she &apos;s got something that she &apos;s hiding
and this guy wants to expose her .
exactly , that &apos;s what he does , he prowls the internet
looking for victims who have dark secrets
and then he forces them to confess &apos; cause ...
what , he &apos;s a vigilante with a god complex .
no , this guy &apos;s face is all over the news .
okay , and that is why
he didn &apos;t take her to any of those spots , right ?
i mean , he &apos;s smart , he knows we &apos;d be on &apos; em .
he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s also a psychopath .
i &apos;m not looking forward to seeing what this guy does
now that his back &apos;s against the wall .
please .
i don &apos;t want to die .
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s a murderer .
视频直播即将开始
this link was just posted
to addison &apos;s profile page .
it &apos;s a web stream . it &apos;s about to go live .
toast ?
i &apos;m on it .
my name is addison wells .
as most of you know , i was kidnapped last night .
but what you don &apos;t know is the reason why .
for years now , i &apos;ve been keeping a secret .
toast , talk to me .
he &apos;s got the feed on a five @-@ second relay .
it &apos;s being bounced off proxy servers all over the world .
can you trace it ?
i could if i had a few hours .
we don &apos;t have a few hours .
if we don &apos;t find this guy by the end of this feed ,
this girl is as good as dead .
yeah , enough with the pressure , man .
and i haven &apos;t even smoked my morning bowl yet .
the truth is
i haven &apos;t been honest about who i am
and the mistakes that i have made .
and now i &apos;m going to confess .
we &apos;re running out of time .
five years ago in pl ...
what the hell just happened ?
she just got played off by fatso the keyboard cat .
somebody deliberately knocked that feed offline .
and that someone was me .
toast , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting you your location
the only way i know how .
holm can &apos;t reestablish a connection
without exposing his location . it &apos;s genius .
and what if he just decides to kill this girl ?
what then ?
then i guess i &apos;ll look pretty dumb .
this doesn &apos;t change anything .
when that light goes back on ,
you say exactly what i told you to .
it worked . he took the bait .
not so fast .
i still have to zero in on his location .
how long ?
17 seconds , give or take .
this is my confession .
five years ago in plymouth , minnesota ...
... i was driving my car late at night ...
when i struck a pedestrian ,
killing him instantly .
in my statement , i told the police
that the victim stepped into traffic
and that i didn &apos;t have enough time to brake ,
but that was a lie .
the truth is ...
i wasn &apos;t even looking at the road when it happened .
i was on my phone , reading a text .
because of my own carelessness ,
an innocent man died .
there hasn &apos;t been a day that &apos;s gone by
that i haven &apos;t thought about it .
i &apos;m so sorry .
got him .
i wanted to tell his family .
i even wrote the e @-@ mail that i was gonna send .
but you never did , did you ?
sorry .
and now the world will see you for what you really are :
a coward and a liar .
3236 .
you &apos;re letting me go ?
no .
even if i did ,
there would be nothing left to go back to , would there ?
but ...
... i will show you some mercy .
this is officer kalakua
requesting hpd and swat support .
the address is 5625 hoala street in waimalu .
we got blood .
you all right ? are you hurt ?
i &apos;ve got you . it &apos;s all over now .
wonderful !
thanks .
dang , cuz .
you got to perform a gig at the shrimp truck .
pro bono ?
at least until you win your first grammy .
well , since we &apos;re on the topic of regrets--
you not pursuing your music-- i &apos;ll share mine .
years ago i had the opportunity
to participate in doctors without borders .
it was a six month stint in mozambique ,
but i decided not to take it .
why not ?
well , you know , dealing with living , breathing patients
isn &apos;t exactly my strong suit .
that &apos;s why i took up a career in forensic pathology .
apparently , some people consider me awkward and off @-@ putting .
no , that &apos;s crazy .
no way , doc , not you .
thank you .
and yourself , any regrets ?
please .
i &apos;m a two @-@ time felon .
i own four businesses now .
i got no regrets .
actually , cuz ,
business number four is currently resting
at the bottom of the pacific .
it &apos;s a small setback .
when the insurance cash kick in ,
we &apos;ll be back in action .
thong magnet two ?
featuring the music stylings
of shawn &quot; flippa &quot; tupuola .
well , i think we should call it a night .
call me up at 6 a.m. the sun is gonna be blazing .
good night , doc .
good night , flippa .
good night , kamekona .
good night , doc .
good night , little cuz .
good night , big cuz .
good night , stars .
good night , moon .
what was that ?
it &apos;s a signal .
somebody found us .
we &apos;re saved .
actually , i believe those are fireworks .
fireworks ?
look , cheryl , natives .
aloha .
&quot; uninhabited &quot; you said .
there &apos;s a resort on this island ?
apparently so .
and judging from where those fireworks are coming from ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s less than 100 yards away .
oops .
gross .
oh , no , not again .
okay , how am i supposed to poop on the skateboard kids
when they &apos;re moving so fast ?
this-- it &apos;s impossible .
well , you got to fill up on the meatball sub .
larger bowel capacity ,
bigger blast radius .
awesome . awesome .
gross .
ew , penguin poop .
hey , again , i &apos;m sorry about this morning .
i didn &apos;t mean to cramp your style , but , uh , you know ,
it was worth it , right ?
yeah , no problem .
now we all get to go have chicken and waffles .
i just feel bad that
they didn &apos;t have room for everyone in first class .
oh , don &apos;t worry about those guys-- they &apos;re fine .
i got pooped on again .
what the hell .
