&quot; go it alone ? &quot;
surgery is a solo act .
are you sure you don &apos;t want help with that ?
i got it .
come on . come on .
we step up to the table with a scalpel in our hand ,
and we go it alone .
you written your speech yet ?
uh , no . not yet . mer and i are going out for drinks tonight ,
and she &apos;s gonna help me .
the isolation can start to define you .
because even though you &apos;re surrounded by a team ...
so ...
vodka is writing your harper avery acceptance speech ?
tequila .
what it really comes down to is your training ,
your choices , your wits ...
your hands , your stitch .
i &apos;m coming .
to joe &apos;s ? you &apos;re working .
no , to boston . tomorrow .
we can make a -- a night of it , you know ,
champagne ,
room service .
i &apos;m flying out in the morning ,
i &apos;m going to the ceremony ,
and then flying back on the red @-@ eye .
i &apos;ll be gone less than 24 hours .
cristina , this is the biggest day of your life .
did you get a haircut ?
you &apos;re changing the subject .
yep .
it comes down to just you .
it &apos;s been two full weeks of the night shift , alex .
how long can you keep doing this ?
well , i haven &apos;t dropped yet .
well , when you gonna tell robbins ?
when do i have a chance ?
i &apos;m doing surgery 24 hours a day
with a dozen 20 @-@ minute naps in between .
you &apos;re like a double agent . it &apos;s actually pretty sexy .
hey , robbins .
uh , back away , karev . she &apos;s off duty .
oh . i was gonna say you look nice , but whatever .
aww , thank you . it &apos;s date night .
yeah , listen , we &apos;ve been on opposite schedules for weeks ,
so if we don &apos;t take the time to sit down and eat a meal together
and remember why we chose to be married
we will kill each other .
no sweat .
i &apos;ve got everything handled .
enjoy your night .
thank you .
thank you so much . you &apos;re amazing .
she has no idea how amazing i am .
well , i hear we have a dog bite over here .
this is jill and her parents , kyle and nicole .
hi . i &apos;m dr. avery .
she says , &quot; it &apos;s nice to meet you . &quot;
now , your dog bit you , huh ? that doesn &apos;t seem very nice .
jill is deaf , too .
okay .
well , luckily , it &apos;s not too deep .
and since it &apos;s her face , i can go ahead and stitch it right up .
nothing to worry about .
he says , &quot; don &apos;t worry . &quot;
that &apos;s good . right here , okay ?
we are not getting rid of the dog .
she was pulling his tail .
he growled to let her know he didn &apos;t like it .
i know she can &apos;t hear .
excuse me . kyle , have you and nicole considered
a cochlear implant for jill at all ?
uh , yeah , we &apos;ve talked about it . we &apos;re not interested .
she &apos;s the perfect candidate .
she &apos;s the right age , she &apos;s healthy ,
and now is the time where she would get the most benefit .
yes , i told him &quot; no . &quot; it &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
we feel very strongly about that .
okay .
see ? now you made her yell .
he didn &apos;t say anything about her being diseased .
you &apos;re overreacting .
oh , n @-@ no , no . i @-@ i apologize . i &apos;m sorry .
we understand and completely respect your decision .
let &apos;s just get your little girl all stitched up , okay ?
this is a common complication of gastric bypass .
the connections
that your previous surgeon created widened ,
so your stomach pouch and intestines have stretched out .
so , basically ,
it &apos;s as if i &apos;d never had the surgery done at all .
well , dr. grey and i are confident we were able to
restore the anatomy of the gastric @-@ bypass procedure
back to the way it was prior to stretching out .
is anyone here with you ?
no . i had my wife drop me off .
she was there the first time ,
so i told her she could sit this one out .
i can handle a couple of nights in the hospital on my own .
well , you won &apos;t be alone .
there will be someone here to monitor you throughout the night .
now , you just get some rest , okay ?
given his co @-@ morbidities ,
he &apos;s a high risk for post @-@ op complications ,
which means one of us
is gonna have to stay here with him tonight .
this is where you offer to do it .
i kind of have plans .
ah , the all @-@ nighter , grey .
it &apos;s the experience that tests you the most ,
teaches you the most .
and when you look back on your career ,
you remember it most fondly .
i know that because i did one last monday night .
that means you &apos;re well @-@ rested . perfect .
good night .
kathleen .
would you find dr. shepherd
and ask him to pick up the children at daycare ?
i thought we &apos;d take the lead on gene receptors .
we do gene receptors .
sir ?
gene receptors are our bread and butter .
you tell claesson that if he --
even when i understand him , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand him .
you pushed nova jenkins &apos; hippocampectomy again ?
yeah , i had to .
uh , i got to take these calls on gdansk time .
you referred three cases to the cleveland clinic last week .
this is not okay , derek . uh , people come here for you .
you still work here .
you &apos;re the one who talked me
into this project in the first place .
webber tells me that you canceled your lecture .
that &apos;s the fourth time you canceled
on the residents this month .
i know that something has to give .
but not surgery , and it can &apos;t be teaching either .
i &apos;ll handle it .
i &apos;ve got it handled .
hello ? dr. shepherd ?
yeah . hold on a second .
the lectures will happen
and just put nova jenkins &apos; surgery
back on the boards for tonight ,
and i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll handle it .
okay .
dr. shepherd ?
dr. shepherd ? dr. grey wanted me to ...
remind you to pick up the kids at daycare tonight .
yes , got it . got it handled .
excuse me , dr. shepherd ? are you there ?
yeah , hi . sorry .
hello ? dr. shepherd ?
braden &apos;s bone @-@ marrow extraction went very well ,
um , but he &apos;s gonna be in some pain for a while .
hey , you did great , braden . we &apos;re almost there .
mm . cool .
can you explain it to us one more time ?
because it still sounds like you &apos;re gonna give our son h.i.v.
n @-@ no . um , it &apos;s gene therapy .
you know , braden lacks the a.d.a. enzyme .
without it , he has no immunity .
so in order to get it into him ,
i &apos;m going to deliver it on a fast @-@ replicating virus .
the h.i.v. virus .
yes , which will disseminate the enzyme
until it grows on its own .
you want to inject him with h.i.v. ?
no , not per se .
for the past two weeks ,
i &apos;ve been working to genetically disable an h.i.v. virus .
okay , the h.i.v. is ... like a hat , okay ?
the virus is what matters .
i &apos;ve taken off the h.i.v. hat ,
and i &apos;m gonna make it wear an enzyme hat .
i ... i know . it ... it sounds counterintuitive and scary .
but i think this is his best shot .
we ... we trust you .
okay .
hey , we &apos;re gonna go , champ .
you gonna be okay ?
he &apos;s probably gonna sleep for the rest of the night .
well , sweet dreams , bradie @-@ bug .
hey , dream about replicating genes .
or ... bunnies .
thank you .
hey . why aren &apos;t you dressed ?
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t go .
i have to babysit my bypass patient .
come on , tomorrow everything changes .
i won &apos;t have time to talk to you .
i &apos;ll be too busy being better than you .
good thing it &apos;s not gonna go to your head .
oh , the speech .
thank people and be funny because people love funny .
there &apos;s nothing funny about babies with hlhs .
you &apos;re no help to me .
alex , tonight is your lucky night
because i will go drinking with you .
can &apos;t . working .
kepner .
yeah ?
never mind .
okay .
hey , i just wanted to check in before i go .
kids , dr. yang &apos;s here . say hello .
hi .
i &apos;m sorry .
john bought them these tablets ,
and it &apos;s destroying their brains .
i &apos;m always the bad guy .
it was a joke , john .
oh , i &apos;m j ... i &apos;m just gonna be gone for 24 hours ,
so you can call dr. hunt
if you have any questions or problems , okay ?
enjoy it .
okay .
what ?
what did i say now ?
nothing , john .
don &apos;t &quot; nothing . &quot; what ?
nothing .
you get to go every day .
to work .
still , you get a break .
and then i &apos;m here every night , sabine , after i work ,
then check on the house , run our errands , do the laundry .
i come here to play with the kids so you can get a break .
you play with the kids ? really ?
you hand the tablets , and then you watch sports .
we &apos;re basically living in a hospital .
i can &apos;t exactly go out and toss a ball around in the backyard .
mom , dad .
i have to go . okay . you can go , sabine .
you can go anytime i &apos;m here ,
but you don &apos;t dare because you &apos;re the only decent parent .
i never said that .
you never say anything ! you jab at me !
you guys , you &apos;re giving me a headache .
and then you back away and act like nothing happened .
john , cut it out !
okay , you guys need to just bring it ...
no . damn it , john . just go . if you ... if you want to , go !
we can &apos;t go anywhere !
okay , sabine , sit down .
john , you need to leave .
where am i supposed to ...
i don &apos;t care , but you need to go right now .
but that &apos;s not fair . karaoke &apos;s my thing .
now , you can &apos;t go without me .
wait . this is a karaoke bar ?
it &apos;s a regular bar that happens to have karaoke .
how is that different ?
it &apos;s totally different ,
and that &apos;s something i know
because karaoke &apos;s kind of my thing .
if it makes you feel any better ,
i &apos;m also gonna be missing out .
i &apos;m just coming off a 32 @-@ hour run .
all i really want is a hot bath and a soft pillow .
gramps ,
how about a glass of warm milk , too ?
see ? you mock . but actually , that sounds fantastic .
okay , everybody , get out of your streets and into your scrubs .
i &apos;m gonna teach you everything there is to know
about a hippocampectomy .
but you canceled that lecture .
yes , i did , and i did you a disservice .
not only is it a rare procedure ,
it &apos;s one of the most delicate and elegant
a neurosurgeon can perform ,
which you will see later tonight when you scrub in with me .
tonight ?
unless you have something else better to do
than to cure a young girl of her debilitating seizures ,
dr. warren .
no .
hey , miranda .
hey , come look at my virus .
oh , i can &apos;t . i ... i thought i was going home .
but shepherd &apos;s got us pulling an all @-@ nighter .
oh . but ...
what are you doing ?
watching my virus chill .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s crazy .
i just removed stem cells from braden &apos;s bone marrow
and injected them into this disabled virus .
i just pulled a 32 @-@ hour shift .
you see , i ... i should be sleeping , but i &apos;m working .
and you are here and have no work .
you should go home ...
and sleep ... for me .
i &apos;m just gonna watch .
go to sleep !
&quot; boundaries are only there to be pushed .
&quot; i am grateful for the opportunity to have pushed .
i &apos;m also grateful for the recognition . &quot;
how &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s kind of braggy .
well , it &apos;s supposed to be braggy .
i &apos;m winning an award . my turn ?
yes , i have very steady hands .
braggy .
what are you still doing here ?
oh , hey ...
well , a bunch of stuff happened .
ivy , your head okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s just a headache . it &apos;s getting better .
john and sabine had a complete meltdown .
i kicked him out , and she &apos;s downstairs getting coffee .
i am trying to distract the kids .
my drinking buddy is stuck at the hospital ,
and i still have to write my speech .
so will you help me ?
hey , frankie . i can &apos;t sleep .
want to play hide @-@ and @-@ seek ?
can i ?
15 minutes .
you paged me to listen to your speech ?
maybe .
oh , come on . you can &apos;t be that busy .
there he is . you ought to be ashamed .
chelsea , don &apos;t yell at him .
he &apos;s doing his best .
no . nova , you &apos;re sweet .
but you &apos;re push over , and you won &apos;t say this , so i will .
she &apos;s sick , and you keep jerking her around ,
scheduling her surgery , then canceling it ,
scheduling and canceling .
she hasn &apos;t eaten in two days
and has had three seizures in the last six hours .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s been so difficult ,
but we are going to do the surgery .
when
tonight .
the o.r. is available at 1 : 30,
so , technically , it &apos;s the morning .
really ?
really .
finally ?
well , there you go .
see what a little backbone will get you ?
1 : 30 a.m. that &apos;s still hours away .
well , don &apos;t worry , dr. warren .
i just got a page from the e.r.
we &apos;ll have plenty to do before then .
come along .
aww , poor gramps .
i &apos;m fine .
what happened ?
his blood pressure is dropping ,
and his heart rate is in the 130s .
n.g. tube lavage is clear .
he &apos;s got a g.i. bleed ,
either from the remnant or the j @-@ j staple line .
activate the massive @-@ transfusion protocol .
call the o.r. and let them know we &apos;re coming .
get me a second @-@ year resident .
i &apos;m gonna need extra hands in there .
none of the second years are available .
they &apos;re all with dr. shepherd .
dr. shepherd isn &apos;t even in the hospital .
he is . he has surgery scheduled .
then where the hell are my kids ? !
and it &apos;s not like i &apos;m insensitive to deaf culture or anything .
i just don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t get how , as parents ,
you don &apos;t want your kid to experience hearing ,
if they could .
why , you disagree ?
they &apos;re her parents , jackson , not us .
yeah , well , if that was our kid ,
she &apos;d be fitted for an implant three years ago .
really ?
yeah .
just like that ?
what if i ... felt differently about it ?
do you ?
yeah .
o @-@ okay .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t dismiss how i feel .
my opinion matters .
i am one half of this relationship .
it &apos;s my kid , too ,
and it &apos;s not getting a cochlear implant .
all r--
it &apos;s important that we immerse them
in the deaf community ,
who consider deafness , by the way ,
to be a blessing and not a disability ,
instead of just opting for an elective surgery .
i &apos;m sorry . a @-@ a blessing ?
what -- what happened ?
ivy spiked a fever ,
and she &apos;s experiencing some shortness of breath .
mom , is everything okay ?
not -- not now , honey .
can i keep playing ?
uh , yeah . sure , sure . just stay close .
i &apos;m going to book an o.r.
and do a biopsy right away .
you should call jon and get him back here .
why ? what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i think ivy is rejecting her heart .
this remnant is completely distended .
try his cell again .
all right , i &apos;m performing a gastrotomy
to remove the intraluminal blood .
keep transfusing until i get the bleeding controlled .
suction . lap pad .
more suction .
hi , you &apos;ve reached dr. shepherd .
please leave a message , and i will return your call .
derek , the daycare is closed ,
the babysitters have not heard from you ,
and no one is answering at home .
where are our children , derek ?
now , a ring fracture almost always causes the dural to tear .
you need to take care not to make it worse .
murphy , get in here and help her retract .
you need to see where you &apos;re going as you extract .
dr. shepherd , this man flatlined five minutes ago .
yeah , that &apos;s true ,
but this a great opportunity to learn on an actual brain .
it does seem a little strange .
if by &quot; strange , &quot; you mean &quot; awesome . &quot;
dr. shepherd .
yes ?
dr. grey &apos;s in o.r. 3
and needs to speak to you right away .
right . okay , where &apos;s my phone ?
where did i put my lab coat ?
30 seconds .
just ... 30 seconds .
oh , wow , you just spit up all over my pretty dress ,
didn &apos;t you , bailey ?
okay , i canceled the reservation .
shepherd owes us big time .
he said he owes us , right ?
yes . something about taking sofia for the weekend
so we could have a getaway , and i &apos;m holding him to it .
um , callie , can you hold him ? &apos; cause it &apos;s -- it &apos;s dribbling .
yeah . oh , here .
hi ! look at that .
bailey . yes , hi .
hello . yes , hi .
look at that .
oh , my gosh .
you forget what it &apos;s like to have one this small .
how did we do it before ?
oh , well , we had mark . god , i miss mark .
yeah , i miss him , too . and three &apos;s a lot .
makes me think we should stop after i have this next one .
what do you mean after you have the next one ?
oh , well , i meant &quot; we . &quot;
i was just saying &quot; i &quot; &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna , you know , have it .
oh . you &apos;re gonna have the next one ?
i didn &apos;t know that we decided that .
i didn &apos;t know there was anything to decide .
amazing .
fantastic .
disgusting !
edwards .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. shepherd .
yeah , don &apos;t apologize to me .
apologize to mr. quaid .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. quaid .
it &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s gross -- super @-@ gross .
hey , doc .
figure out how you &apos;re gonna
get these bastards out of my noggin ?
yes . it will be a , uh , very careful , very precise ...
yank .
oh , me ! me , me , me !
do i have to do that thing
where i acknowledge the losers ?
&apos;cause i have like five minutes .
i don &apos;t want to waste it on people i don &apos;t even know .
mm , it is a courtesy .
you &apos;re nervous .
you know , i know you think that i &apos;m too busy ,
but i can make it work , if you don &apos;t want to be alone .
but i do .
wait , you think you &apos;re gonna lose ?
let me go alone .
i &apos;ll update the family .
come on . don &apos;t be such a weenie .
i &apos;m not being a weenie .
you &apos;re kind of being a weenie .
murphy , the shears have only hit areas
of non @-@ eloquent brain function .
the risk of further damage is minimal .
so go ahead . pull it out .
wait .
okay , vessels intact . go ahead .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , she &apos;s not going anywhere .
dr. shepherd , permission to step in .
mm @-@ hmm .
thank you .
okay .
well , that was a little much .
way to go , lady hulk .
get ready for a big bleeder and a crash @-@ dive craniotomy .
in your face !
not you , dr. shepherd .
um , irrigation .
nova jenkins is prepped and ready for surgery .
okay , great . i &apos;ve got a little more to do with mr. quaid here .
but , guys , go eat and hydrate .
i &apos;ll see you in the o.r. in about eight minutes . hustle .
derek .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
where the hell are my kids ?
don &apos;t do that !
don &apos;t walk away from me when i &apos;m in the middle of a sentence .
can we just go to bed , please ?
i can &apos;t sleep now , not when you &apos;re willfully ignoring
my wishes , my beliefs--
about what ? our fictitious child ?
it &apos;s irrelevant .
you know how slim the chances are of our kid being deaf ?
that is not the point !
what is the point ?
you-- you think they &apos;re stupid .
you think that they are being bad parents
because they want to raise their kid differently than you would .
come on . i never said that .
you are judging them !
you think they &apos;re ridiculous .
why are we arguing about this ?
because it means you think i &apos;m ridiculous , too !
wait a second . what ?
replace &quot; cochlear implant &quot; with the word &quot; christening ... &quot;
... &quot; bible study ... &quot;
&quot; prayer . &quot;
now tell me this has nothing to do with us .
come on . pick up , pick up , pick up .
jon , where are you ?
they just took ivy up to the o.r.
they think that she &apos;s rejecting her heart .
i can &apos;t find frankie . she disappeared .
you just have to get back here .
call me as soon as you get this .
what do you mean you can &apos;t find frankie ?
oh , do you know where she is ?
what ?
watch out .
well , she usually hides somewhere over here .
gotcha .
bam ! gotcha , frankie !
wake up .
wake up . frankie , wake up !
wait , hold on , braden . back up .
left , left , left . hold it .
back up . back up .
right . right , right .
hold it . back up . ba-- back up .
oh . oh , crap .
frankie !
do you know where she is ?
no , crappy camera couldn &apos;t zoom in on a room number .
she &apos;s in a linen storage .
well , which one ?
i don &apos;t know .
that one .
pulse is faint .
let &apos;s get her on a bed and on a monitor .
ivy &apos;s biopsy sample &apos;s on its way to path .
frankie &apos;s in heart failure .
karev and i ran an ekg .
it &apos;s not her pacemaker .
she needs an lvad .
crap . these kids are like surgical dominos .
okay , let &apos;s get her ready .
karev &apos;s prepping her in o.r. 4 .
what time &apos;s your flight ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
three hours ?
for three hours , derek ,
i had no idea where our children were .
i had my hand inside a guy &apos;s stomach ,
and all i could think was--
i told you i had it handled .
you told me you had them .
i thought i did .
i had a surgery . i had to teach .
hunt and webber accused me of dropping the ball .
you dropped this ball .
if you put our kids somewhere , derek , you have to tell me .
let &apos;s just step back for a second
and take a look that the kids are fine , okay ?
i just forgot to make a phone call , okay ?
now i &apos;ve got a surgery to get to .
no , they &apos;re fine .
zola &apos;s asleep and bailey was out like a light .
no , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know why derek didn &apos;t tell you .
yeah .
no , not a problem . anytime .
okay . bye .
i never would have just assumed
you didn &apos;t want to carry our child .
you said , &quot; i can &apos;t take another loss . it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
i took that as a &quot; no . &quot;
and i was afraid that if i asked you again ,
it would make you too sad .
okay , that was a year ago ,
and there was a lot going on , and maybe i changed my mind .
have you ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
arizona , if it would make you happy , it would make me happy .
yeah , hmm . y @-@ yeah .
but do you think i should ?
now , with this approach ,
we go straight down the barrel to the hippocampus .
questions ?
stop . okay , hold it . here . let &apos;s just slow down .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do-- i &apos;m gonna have each one of you
take a turn next to me at the microscope .
whoever is at the microscope will ask one question .
ross , you go first .
where &apos;s gramps ?
who cares ?
more microscope time for us .
good point .
okay , i think you &apos;re blowing this out of proportion .
am i ? because this is who i am .
at my core , this ... this defines me .
and i know that . i love you still .
oh , well , thank you .
thank you so much for loving me anyway--
despite my beliefs , despite my faith ,
which i happen to hold above everything else .
you &apos;re twisting my words . it &apos;s not--
and you &apos;re ignoring mine !
you don &apos;t accept who i am or what i believe .
you tolerate it . you judge it .
you judge my faith because you don &apos;t have any .
i have faith .
i have faith in medicine . i have faith in helping people .
that &apos;s not faith !
faith is believing in what you can &apos;t see .
will you just admit it , jackson ?
you think what i believe is ridiculous .
yes , because it is ! yes .
your god is like our hypothetical deaf child , april .
it &apos;s not real .
look , all right , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m s @-@ sorry .
it &apos;s n-- it doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t respect you .
it &apos;s just ...
god , i just feel --
i just feel sorry for you .
you don &apos;t know how to believe in something
you can &apos;t touch or feel , and that ...
is so sad .
so you pity me .
i ... i-- i do .
i really do .
we should go to sleep .
looks like frankie &apos;s lvad has good flow .
i agree . passing the cannulas .
got it . thioproline .
start protamine , please .
alex , you &apos;re still here ?
night shift . you &apos;re still here ?
yes , we &apos;re all still here , obviously .
did you finish your speech ?
nah , i -- i &apos;m just gonna wing it .
it &apos;s weird . they &apos;ve made their decision .
your name is typed on a piece of paper in an envelope . i know .
i always figured i &apos;d read about you winning the harper avery .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be operating with you
the night before you won it .
when is the last time we all pulled an all @-@ nighter together ?
third year ?
oh , god . look at us now . you &apos;ve got two kids .
i mean , you &apos;re about to win a harper avery .
and alex ...
oh , sad .
oh , shut up . i got my own stuff .
what stuff ?
oh , lying . sadder .
a private practice is interested in me ,
and i think i &apos;m gonna take it .
a private practice ? is this the butthole guy ?
i &apos;ve been moonlighting over there , taking some shifts ,
just to see if i get along with his partner .
don &apos;t tell robbins .
oh .
and i &apos;m killing it .
and i &apos;m killing it here at night .
i &apos;m killing it 24 hours a day , and i can &apos;t tell anyone .
private practice ?
why in the world would you want that ?
because my fellowship is ending , and it &apos;s a crapload of money .
and didn &apos;t come from a rich family like you ,
and i &apos;m probably not gonna win

surgeons are trained to go it alone ,
to be solo artists ,
to be mavericks -- both in and out of the o.r.
but the truth is , we are never alone .
what ?

we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us .
surgery
is the boldest and most fearless of the healing arts .
we stand side @-@ by @-@ side
with the colleagues who have supported us , prepared us ...

who have destroyed the obstacles ,
altered the direction ,
and invented the future
of how we are to live and heal and thrive .
the surgeons in this room are redefining medicine
for generations to come .
... for the moment that every surgeon lives for ...
and so i am very pleased to announce this year &apos;s winner .
... when it all comes down to your training , your choices ,
your wits , your hands , your stitch ...
the harper avery award goes to ...
... when it all comes down to you .
