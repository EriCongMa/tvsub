Baby did a bad, bad thing?
Baby did a bad, bad thing
It was e-mailed to campus inboxes.
Do you know who sent it?
My guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
I'm not saying anything bad.
No, of course not.
I just think it was this video
that provoked the fight at the interfaith rally.
And you want us to defend...?
Jimal Mifsud.
Scholarship student in Science.
His family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
Do you know his family?
No,
I am purely an interested bystander here
who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
There's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths,
and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
Well, he doesn't have a record,
so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
Court supervision, at most.
No, the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
It was deemed a hate crime.
Seven years.
Alicia,
meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend
who until recently retained our competitor Young, Bachman and Meyers
for his legal interest.
To my eternal regret.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
Alicia's fine.
Your husband was very good
to the Muslim community in his first term.
My fear is, that's changed.
Of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way,
but she is still one of our best lawyers.
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
Bond hearing's today. I'll be there.
Good, that's one piece of business.
What else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
What's the crisis?
Where's the management?
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?
And ask Will to step in.
Will? Sure.
He's late. Overslept.
Must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
Must be.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone. Hey, Mom, pick up...
Hello, dearest daughter.
You sound happy.
I am happy.
I have my daughter on the phone. What more could I desire?
Look, I don't think I need a tutor.
Grace, we discussed this. It's just a month.
Yeah, but it was one report card.
And it's one month.
Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli? The meeting.
Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
You and Dad. Both of you.
Why?
Just to be nice. I didn't tell them anything.
It was like you said;
I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
Okay, I'll talk to your father about it. I-I've got to go.
So, who is this guy again?
Wasim Al-Said.
He's a commodities trader.
Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
He has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
On what?
A campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
Do you watch the evening news, Eli?
Religiously.
Then you know there was a murder
of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
Unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
Ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus
at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue,
and only one Muslim was arrested.
Now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country,
and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
Isn't that true?
It is.
So, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
Because I imagine it might look quite good
having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
Can't it be both?
I don't like being used.
Really? Since when?
He knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign
and he wants to buy influence.
And...?
Don't you get so knowing on me.
What's up with you, anyway?
You seem different.
Where you going?
Court.
Why?
I'm a lawyer.
Okay, glad we cleared that up.
This is a hate crime, Your Honor,
and we ask that bail be set at $100,000.
Have you ever been in a fistfight, counselor?
Have I, Your Honor? No.
Well, let me educate you.
It's chaos, chaos in there. No one can tell who hits who.
Fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
The next thing you know,
you're on the ground and somebody's jumping on top.
Jimal, I'm sorry to be late.
I was...
Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.
And Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting.
Only one was charged. One Muslim.
His religion had nothing to...
It had everything to do with it.
All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
Bond is set at $5,000.
And I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
You have a benefactor who asked me to step in.
Are you all right?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution
to get you to accept a higher plea.
The good news is, the judge is on your side.
Now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
No, no they wouldn't... Look, I'm ashamed.
I understand. Hopefully, we can handle this by admitting simple battery.
But I didn't... I wasn't even there.
He wasn't at the rally, Cary. He was at the library.
Oh, my God, really? That's terrible.
This isn't about Jimal,
and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
This is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death,
and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
We have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
That's what this is about.
Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
Why not ask if he's Jewish?
Cross-racial identification.
Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
Six months in County, one year probation.
No.
Then I'll see you in court.
Tell Peter there has to be a better way
to firm up his campaign contributions.
Using everything we can, are we?
It's a new day.
We're running a clean office.
Let me say that again, because
we're all prone to the same cynicism.
We... are running a clean office.
Clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
But our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
That's right.
Defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
So for the next two months,
I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
After that, you won't have to work as hard.
You get your enemy flinching,
you'll never have to hit him hard again.
Your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
That's why I've hired an outside contractor
until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
She's good, and she's cheap.
Thanks!
Relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months
on the college hate crime. Should I walk it back?
What's the law say?
Three to seven years.
There's your answer.
The lawyer's Alicia,
and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really?
Yeah. What do you want?
Follow the law.
You can't go wrong if you follow the law.
All right.
Geez, what a pit.
Thank you.
You're working on the, uh,
the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime. Why? What do you need?
Oh, it's not what I need.
What is this?
You used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah.
If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
So, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
And here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
What's that?
It's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so...
this is me being clean.
You're welcome.
You can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
You need to go positive.
Link the Arab spring to the American Revolution.
Who is the Islamic George Washington?
Who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
Morning in the Middle East...
Do you need something?
It's on your desk. It's self-explanatory.
That's your car?
Good. Now, I know you said you were at the library.
But the time code on that traffic light
shows that the driver of your car was running
a red light just outside the campus gates
at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
That means that the driver of your car, if that is you,
couldn't have been involved in the rally fight.
Do you understand?
I do.
So, I want you to take your time before you answer.
Is that you driving your car?
It is.
Are you certain, young man?
It's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
We ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath
that he was the driver in this photo
which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
Your Honor, is that really necessary?
It's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
Very well. Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
Do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes.
Good. Well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up,
doesn't it, Mr. Agos? I'm late for the gym.
It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible
mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery.
But this car with this license plate
was seen racing away from the scene of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg
Objection, Your Honor!
That is why he ran the red light.
Oh, this is outrageous.
He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
This is prosecutorial misconduct.
He swore to it.
His alibi means he committed this murder.
Because you overcharged him with a hate crime
so he would grab at any alibi.
So you're saying your client perjured himself?
No, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
Well, then congratulations, Alicia.
You just advised your client to admit to murder.
Your Honor,
the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
Alicia dropped by for you.
Why?
I don't know. You want me to get her?
No. Later.
So this isn't you?
It's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
So who is it? Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car--
your car-- was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
So don't cover for anyone.
I'm not covering.
My-My two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine.
I just leave my keys in the room.
So which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
But he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
He didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
It's my fault.
I encouraged him to place himself in the car
to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes. And now I have a multimillion-dollar client
thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
I should've checked.
Great. It's everybody's fault.
Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates.
One of them is the real driver.
And I'm filing a motion to dismiss
Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two,
but make it better.
Whatever you have to do.
Make it better.
So are we supposed to do something?
Sure.
What subject?
I don't know.
You're the tutor.
What does your mom want?
She wants me to get better grades,
so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
You don't like public school?
No, I do.
It's just that there was a mugging on the field,
and all the parents got really scared.
Is this your first job tutoring?
Yeah.
How am I doing?
Not so good.
Darn.
Can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary the man!
Throwing down that opposition.
Nicely played.
Thanks.
So this is the new Cary?
No, just a new day.
So can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
Well, come on.
You're in the big leagues now. What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
Well, look who's here.
Sophia?
In the flesh.
Strange bedfellows, huh?
The strangest.
Well...
you two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
Crime scene photos.
Damn it.
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22,
found in his dorm room gagged,
hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
Little overkill?
Yep.
Police think it was an execution.
No sign of a struggle.
Any witnesses?
Neighbor heard a scream,
looked out his window and saw a dark,
possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
They got a number plate-- ET27.
Damn.
That's not a partial plate.
Yeah, I know.
Jimal's plate.
Um, one other thing.
Something that wasn't released to the press.
What?
Killer drew a swastika
with the victim's blood.
Yep. I know this is not looking good, is it?
Okay, um,
let me know what you get from the roommates.
Got it.
Oh, by the way, the swastika
- the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
Okay.
Am I interrupting?
Nope.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have a moment to talk?
About last night?
Yeah.
Don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
You're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
It's an anti- muslim-bigotry campaign,
and I am a crisis man...
You are a Jew.
We are both...
Oh, come on, Michael!
What is this?
Ultimate Frisbee?
We only win by making them lose?
Yes.
You act like you're not paying attention,
but I know you're paying attention.
This is a PR war.
And I'm a traitor?
In February, Israeli soldiers
helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
You didn't read about it unless you subscribed
to the Israel National News.
Two days later, an Israeli woman
gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
Where did you read it? AP, CBS News, every major paper.
Google it. Go ahead.
This is a PR war and they are winning.
Michael.
I do not go to your house
and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee
and tell you what lobbyists to hire.
That's it.
Now I get it.
I didn't hire you.
There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky & Associates.
With a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
So this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
It's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
You're paying a competitor, Michael.
And as moved as I am by your plea for Jewish brotherhood,
I'm not that moved.
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
So you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
This is just like the cops.
Racist.
They think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
You were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
No.
And you know why it's not me?
Look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah.
Evening prayers.
Anybody else see you there?
Yes.
Who?
The Prophet Muhammad.
Peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
Okay, Tariq.
Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
No.
So you were home?
You were home to be able to not see him there?
No, I was out.
In Jimal's car?
No, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
So where were you?
I was here.
In the quad at the interfaith rally.
Sophia.
Kalinda.
Hi.
I didn't see you over there.
This is how you investigate these days?
By just following me?
Yep.
Makes things a lot easier.
So you and Cary, huh?
That's why you've been ignoring me, right?
It's not because I'm married.
Yep. You got me.
Listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
Do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
Your Honor, this is...
this is prosecutorial misconduct.
Okay, okay, okay.
This is absolutely unethical.
All right, all right.
Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client
already swore that that was him in the car.
Is he now trying to say that he lied?
He's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
How did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity
to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it,
that's all.
This murder charge is based on nothing else.
There's no evidence that Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim,
and as you can see here, Your Honor,
a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
Oh, come on.
Anti-Semitism
isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply to any dark-skinned...
All right, counselors, listen.
Nobody likes a street fight better than me,
but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
Because if it's just that statement,
I am prone to overturn.
We do, Your Honor.
Professor Noah Fineman.
I teach political science.
And did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
He did.
It's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11
about chickens who come home to roost
for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
Objection.
Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying
to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
Why not home ec?
Maybe that's where the knife came from.
Overruled. I think we can stand a bit
of rough and tumble here, counselor.
So, Professor,
you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
Oh, I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
Given this, what do you think of suicide bombings
and the death of Jewish citizens?
If you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
But I do understand them.
These are understandable movements
against a Zionist oppression.
And how did your student Jimal
take an added interest in this lecture?
Well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
And afterwards, he approached me
to ask me questions about my newest book,
Zionist Occupation: the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
Thank you, Professor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Actually, Professor,
I have a few questions.
My client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
How did you witness this?
Well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
And for how long did you teach Jimal?
Well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
So four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
And for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
How many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching
and not having one of your TA's do it?
Uh... Didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
Well, I would question your use of the word "Only,"
but, uh...
yes.
And yet you really focused with your laser-like perception
on Jimal and his engagement.
You're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started.
So, after one of your lectures,
Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
How do you know this?
Because I keep a record next to my attendance. See?
That asterisk tells me that I must send them
an e-mail about my book.
And, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Oh, yes.
This record attendance,
the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure.
Do you see Jimal's name there?
It's him there.
That's not his handwriting.
Objection.
That's the handwriting of his roommate,
Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in
so that Jimal could cut class.
Well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really?
How's that?
In court, these people don't really know how you think.
But you do?
Hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
Good luck with that.
Battle M.E. Gaza Strip
It's one of my best MMOGs.
And what is an MMOG?
Massive Multiplayer Online Game.
Meaning people log onto their computers
and battle each other.
Yep.
What are we looking at now?
Uh, well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
That's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
Objection.
Your Honor,
what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
Goes to motive, Your Honor.
What is that assault weapon over there, is that an Uzi?
No, it's a Galil 5.56.
What's the range of fire?
450 meters.
Cool.
Proceed.
Well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
The guy running.
And what is he wearing?
Oh, that? That's a suicide vest.
He's wearing a suicide vest?
And what is he entering?
That's a civilian Israeli building.
That's a school, in fact...
Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
He wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
He is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing
will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
He wasn't making light of it.
He was playing a video game.
In which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
Have you seen video games lately?
We can't abandon Jimal.
He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
We helped him into a murder charge.
"We"?
I... helped him into a murder charge,
which I did as a representative of this firm.
We made a commitment to him.
What do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign
and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
Still, retail rules.
We broke it, we own it?
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
Win this one.
No.
No, what?
No, Mr. Al-Said.
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore.
I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
Oh, that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
You did not.
I did.
You know us Jews.
You'd do anything to piss me off.
You're right.
But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
Good doing business with you.
Did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
No.
But I'm sure it's very funny.
An Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
And then they kill each other.
Energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...?
Patterns of black body radiation.
You know that's bad for you?
It's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
But I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
Oh, my God.
What?
Okay, I need your help.
Don't shake the camera.
Just keep it steady.
What are you doing?
Look at the color.
It's Bollywood.
You can't pass up Bollywood.
Do you know them?
No. It's chance.
I do this all the time.
Grace, camera up.
What are you doing?
Good to have you back, Mr. Sartori.
So tell me, what is a power-up?
Sorry, this is the only place in the world
where I have to explain a power-up.
Um, in a video game,
it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
Like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
So, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
Huh? No.
Not unless you're crazy.
You never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
So this suicide vest that Jimal's Avatar is wearing, what is that?
It's a power-up.
And everybody who plays your game grabs one?
At one point or another.
In fact, according to your own logs,
many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
Objection.
Overruled.
...many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office
have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game.
It's not a thing.
But doesn't that mean these ASAs
are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori,
Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan,
he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
This is a record of your subpoenaed logs.
Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
And you had to reduce his privileges
because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online. On the Battle M.E. Board.
And who did he fight with? Can you read that there?
You had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg.
Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
But he has an alibi-- praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
What about the other roommate-- Tariq?
We can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
And he doesn't have the political motive.
Amir is the Palestinian hard-liner.
Tariq could care less.
Okay. Thank you, Alicia.
Keep us in touch.
What do you think?
I think...
you're holding something against her.
I'm what?
Alicia.
Maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not,
but you're being hard on her.
No.
She's a third-year associate on a partner track
and she's treating us like peers.
That's all you're seeing.
My God, am I the only adult left here?
Could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting,
unless you have some other stray observations for me.
Are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
Am I?
Going too hard?
All those late nights...
No time off.
Buried... in work.
Up to my knees.
He's doing it again, mom!
He's doing it again!
It's just my neighbors.
Come on, let's go to the bedroom.
No, no, no, no, no. Don't move.
Leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece
after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
We need to eat better.
I like what we eat.
No, I need to cook.
You're happier without dad.
No, I'm happier with you.
Okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
No, it's about dad.
Does that upset you?
No.
I don't know.
You know I love dad.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I found you a new tutor. Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
Actually, I think I like this one now.
You... I thought you said she was too different.
She is.
But sometimes different isn't always bad.
She's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
What?
Mm, she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
Please tell me you're learning something,
and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
So how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
You said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg,
and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
You got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
He claims it wasn't him.
It wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
On the video game.
Amir says it was Tariq.
He let him use his screen name.
These roommates-- they share everything.
So I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
Amir had a motive-- politics, fanaticism.
Tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake
thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
These kids-- they're just... college kids.
All rise.
Okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Thank you.
Please be seated.
So, this is where we stand.
There is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
Further, we set this case on my trial...
Your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
Excuse me?
We believe you have shown bias against our client.
Believe? Really?
In what way?
Your religion.
This is...
outrageous.
I'm...
My Jewish background
is completely irrelevant in this case.
Your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel,
an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
We believe you have shown bias against our client,
and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
He's not going to recuse himself.
He will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
He's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
So we start over with a new judge.
No. I know what Alicia's doing.
Hi, Michael. How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
Arab Spring.
Sort of like Irish Spring,
but with Arabs.
Do you want some coffee?
How much?
For the coffee?
How much for six months
if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
How much are you paying Tarkovsky & Associates?
You know how much I'm paying.
Well, of course,
we would have to tell Mr. Al-Said
that we can't handle his account anymore,
so if you'd help us defer those costs...
You're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
But now I'm your son of a bitch.
All rise.
Judge Karpman presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken great deal of time with this motion because
I believe that part of being a tough judge
is also being a fair judge.
Your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
Can't imagine why, Counselor. I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but... I believe
Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
Excuse me!
If you recuse yourself, Your Honor,
the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
You were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
That's what she's counting on.
Do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
What tomorrow is?
The holiday.
That has nothing to do with my motion.
It's Rosh Hashanah.
There will be no Jewish judges in court,
the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
That is why she's asking you to recuse yourself.
Your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick,
I am...
disappointed in you.
The motion is denied.
Case remains on my trial call!
Hi, Tariq. How are you?
So, what, are you following me?
No.
I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
You know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar,
I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
No, no, no, no.
I'd try Sidetrack.
It's too leathery.
What do you need?
You used Amir's avatar on Battle M.E., the online video game.
So?
So, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
No.
Yeah.
Actually... yeah.
Checked your alibi.
Didn't hold up, Tariq.
You weren't at the Interfaith Rally.
Why would I kill Greenberg?
It-It makes no sense.
We spoke to the bartender.
He said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
My guess is, you two fell in love.
You argued. He met someone else.
You got jealous. You stabbed him.
Made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't!
Why the reversed swastika?
What?
When you set it up as a hate crime,
why did you draw the swastika backward?
What do you mean? Isn't that how you draw it?
Is it good for the Jewish League Fund?
I don't know.
The Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay,
and sleeping with our guy, so, uh,
I would call that a classic mixed message.
Crisis management.
If it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
That was a joke.
Yeah. Okay, I-I-I got to go.
Important work?
Fate of the world.
What do you think?
It's very flattering, Eli.
But I can't be thinking about the governorship
when I'm doing this job.
So do this job.
Let me think about the governorship.
Just an observation from work.
If you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not... worried.
I know, I know, but, um,
if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
They barely look at each other.
Eli.
You don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
No, I...
Forget it.
You need a friend, K.
Why do I need a friend?
Or a dog.
Maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch.
Out investigating.
I'm fine, Will. Really.
What's wrong with me?
We're not like normal people, are we?
What are normal people like?
Emotional.
You're emotional.
No.
Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion,
and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
You want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what it feels like.
Thanks.
I got to go.
I got to be somewhere at 8:45.
Really?
That's specific.
Yup.
Be good.
I'll get them to school on Monday.
You sure?
Yeah.
Do we take our homework?
Yes!
Yes!
So, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did. She's good, I think,
and Grace likes her or... she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
Oh, um, also,
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa--
her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm... I'm busy.
Love you.
Love you.
I love you. You call if you need anything.
