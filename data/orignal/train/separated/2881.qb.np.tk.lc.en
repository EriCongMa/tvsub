remember when i had a monkey ?
what was i thinking ?
hey , so , what &apos;s with the 20 percent tip ? did i do something wrong ?
20 percent is a pretty generous tip .
you know what &apos;s more generous ? 50 percent !
you know what &apos;s even more generous ?
i see where you &apos;re going .
what &apos;s up with the greed ? i &apos;m sorry .
i have to get new headshots made , and they &apos;re really expensive.i &apos;m down to , like , three .
actually , two , because one of them i blackened some teeth.why &apos;d i do that ?
isn &apos;t there something you can do to earn extra money ? can &apos;t you pick up an extra shift here ?
or , you know , i used to beg for money .
it helps if you &apos;ve got a little of this going on .
wow ! i still have it .
don &apos;t you have an audition today ? maybe you &apos;ll get that job .
wait a minute.i used to get medical experiments done on me .
finally , an explanation .
i used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff .
let &apos;s see ... well , i don &apos;t want to donate sperm again.i really prefer doing that at the home office .
maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something , huh ?
joey ?
yeah .
what did i tell you about talking while working ?
do it ?
that guy &apos;s been waiting 10 minutes . he &apos;s complained about you three times .
now , where was l ?
the one with unagi
what are you up to ?
we went to a self @-@ defense class today .
kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you .
takes it out of you ?
now we can kick anybody &apos;s ass .
after one class ? i don &apos;t think so .
you want to see me self @-@ defend myself ?
pretend you &apos;re a predator.go on , i dare you !
of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming .
that &apos;s not enough .
look , i studied karate for a long time .
and there &apos;s a concept you should be familiar with.it &apos;s what the japanese call unagi .
isn &apos;t that a kind of sushi ?
no , it &apos;s a concept.yeah , it is . it &apos;s freshwater eel .
maybe it means that too .
i would kill for a salmon @-@ skin roll right now .
fine , get attacked . i don &apos;t even care .
come on , ross , we &apos;re sorry . please tell us what it is .
unagi is a state of total awareness .
only by achieving true unagi ... can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you .
in case someone &apos;s trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat ... or your kettle of fish ?
it &apos;s one thing being prepared for an attack against each other .
whole other story being prepared for an attack . i don &apos;t know .. surprise !
you knew that was coming ... but that doesn &apos;t mean you have unagi .
if we made reservations , we could have unagi in a half @-@ hour .
is monica here ?
no .
i need help . i don &apos;t know what to get for valentine &apos;s day .
valentine &apos;s day was two weeks ago , so i wouldn &apos;t get her a calendar .
she was working , so we &apos;re celebrating tonight .
why don &apos;t you book a day for both of you at those romantic spas ?
that &apos;s actually a good idea .
and , of course , crotchless panties .
as appealing as that sounds to her boyfriend ... and her brother ...
we promised to make each other gifts this year .
i love that .
you guys !
you can &apos;t make crotchless panties ?
you take scissors and cut .. okay , okay , okay .
making things sounds so much fun .
i thought so too , until i papier @-@ mached one of my eyes shut .
i love papier @-@ mache ! what did you make ?
i made a flar @-@ lar @-@ lar .
what is that ?
nothing !
so , what are you gonna do ?
have you made anything i can take credit for ?
i have , i have ! i started making little sock bunnies ! oh , for crying out loud !
wait a minute . that is my sock !
now it &apos;s your little bunny friend .
okay ...
this actually is a flar @-@ lar @-@ lar .
can i ask about the valentine &apos;s day gifts ? -yeah .
do we have to make the entire thing ? yes . did you forget to make yours ?
of course not .
i just have to go to the place where i made it and pick it up .
i can &apos;t wait . it &apos;ll be the best valentine &apos;s day ever !
i can &apos;t believe it ! make the presents !
what ?
just so excited to make the presents !
shoot
hi , i &apos;m joey tribbiani.with all due respect , i &apos;d like to donate some fluids .
we &apos;re at the end of a research cycle and not looking for applicants now .
that &apos;s too bad . i &apos;ve been saving up .
you sure there &apos;s no studies i can participate in ?
here &apos;s a schedule .
thanks .
this one starts now .
only identical twins are eligible . it &apos;s a twin study .
but it &apos;s $ 2000 ! sorry .
and this ? &quot; testing the effects of joey tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionist . &quot;
results are back on that one . they &apos;re not good .
danger ! danger !
what the hell was that ? a lesson in the importance of unagi .
you &apos;re a freak !
perhaps .
now i &apos;m curious.at what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass ?
all right , so we weren &apos;t prepared !
i &apos;m sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point.i just want you to be safe .
danger !
unagi !
2000 bucks is a lot of money.i wish i had a twin .
where could i find someone ... who looks exactly like me ?
chandler .
i sensed it was you .
what ?
unagi.i &apos;m always aware .
are you aware that unagi is an eel ?
what &apos;s up ?
i can &apos;t figure out what to make monica .
why don &apos;t you make her one of your little jokes ?
i &apos;m going crazy . do you have anything homemade ?
you know what ? she &apos;d love this .
it &apos;s a replica of apollo 8 . i made it in the sixth grade .
i could use that . i could say , &quot; your love sends me to the moon . &quot;
except apollo 8 didn &apos;t actually land on the moon .
you can say , &quot; your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely . &quot;
i can &apos;t give this to her.why not ?
it says &quot; captain ross &quot; on the side.and it says &quot; i hate monica &quot; on the bottom .
danger !
salmon @-@ skin roll .
okey okey
yes , honey , i made it myself .
i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t do it .
a mixed tape ! a mixed tape !
hi ! ready to exchange gifts ? -sure . you go first .

i am going to cook you anything you want in here.and i &apos;m going to do anything you want in there .
well , i did put a lot of thought into the tape .
you are way too young to have seen that .

carl is a guy i hired to be my twin for a medical research project .
sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you .
it sounds crazy , but it might work . the only problem is carl &apos;s acting ...
