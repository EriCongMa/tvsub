oh , hey , honey . have a great time at the game .
thanks .
oh . why are you crunching ?
ordinarily , i &apos;m a rule follower ,
but when someone tells me i can &apos;t bring
my own snacks into their stadium ,
that &apos;s when i get a little nuts .
it &apos;s a free country , right ?
let &apos;s just say it ruffles me ...
when some goobers tell me ...
i have to spend half my payday ...
on their hot dogs .
please , just remember the family portrait .
we only have the photographer for an hour . okay ?
okay .
and , sweetie , did you have a chance to
try on the white pants i put in your closet ?
oh , what do they look like ?
is there really a more clear way to describe white pants ?
sweetie , if they don &apos;t fit you ,
you &apos;re going to be the only one not wearing white ,
and then you &apos;re gonna stand out like &quot; where &apos;s waldo ? &quot;
读者要在一群人当中找出沃尔多 &#93;
actually , &quot; where &apos;s waldo ? &quot; doesn &apos;t stand out .
he &apos;s super hard to find . that &apos;s the challenge .
this portrait is incredibly important to me .
also , his name is just &quot; waldo . &quot;
i spent weeks trying to find
a time that works for everybody ...
and finding the right photographer .
so if you could just promise me that you &apos;ll cooperate , okay ?
i promise .
okay .
this is amazing that you &apos;re doing this .
mmm , thank you .
you &apos;re wonderful .
thank you .
get in here
oh , no can do .
oh .
i love you .
bye .
where &apos;s my good underwear ?
the question is ,
why isn &apos;t all your underwear good , jay ?
you make a nice living .
the new maid keeps mixing up my underwear with manny &apos;s .
put on the first thing i grabbed .
it was like a crotch tourniquet .
you gotta talk to her .
why me ?
hola . you both speak the same language .
she &apos;s portuguese . do you know how offensive it is ...
that you put all of us in the same mixing pot ?
sorry . please apologize to her when you tell her not to
put my underwear-
i can &apos;t talk to her !
where &apos;s luke ?
i &apos;m going instead .
luke suddenly remembered a school project due tomorrow .
oh , that &apos;s tough .
but it &apos;s a good lesson for the kid .
you know , you make a commitment ,
you gotta follow through .
yeah .
what is the project ?
he has to interview somebody who lived through the 1960s .
oh , no .
hello .
yeah , luke .
oh , sure . i remember what i said .
yeah , come on over . all right .
gloria , you &apos;re gonna have to take manny to the game .
yay . manny , vamos !
i &apos;m still getting dressed .
hey , mom , i think my diet &apos;s working .
my underwear won &apos;t stay up .
第一季第二十四集
oh , so delicious . yes .
hey , you &apos;re okay with me not going with you today , right ?
i have been hired to sing at a wedding this weekend .
i was plucked from obscurity
after a particularly stirring karaoke performance .
so i guess you could say i &apos;m a professional singer now .
well , they &apos;re paying you in flowers , so-
well , i would &apos;ve blown the money on flowers anyway .
they &apos;re saving me a step .
plus all the great divas are rewarded in flowers .
they &apos;re also given paychecks .
and i &apos;m really bad at small talk , so-
i get it . it &apos;s not a problem .
are you sure ? &apos; cause you &apos;ve been quiet all morning .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m resting my instrument .
okay .
i feel tension .
kobe ! kobe , over here !
kobe ! kobe ! over here !
what can i do for you ?
do you like being a basketball player ?
serious ?
i choked . i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d look up here at me .
little preparation next time .
it &apos;s a mental game .
duly noted .
all right .
your los angeles lakers !
what &apos;s wrong ?
that broken step .
it &apos;s gonna ruin our whole family portrait .
okay , here &apos;s my idea . i &apos;m really excited about it .
the whole extended family , all dressed in white ,
in a single @-@ file line down the staircase .
oh , like a line on the highway .
no .
or , uh , a ski jump .
no .
why- why would i want a ski jump ?
i don &apos;t know .
my idea was to have the whole family in a giant bed ,
like in willy wonka .
yeah , but that &apos;s ridiculous .
&quot; ridiculicious . &quot;
i don &apos;t see anything .
so i &apos;m crazy ?
no . you &apos;re ... not .
your father was supposed to fix that step .
mom , you &apos;re obsessing over the tiniest little thing-
so you do see it , yeah .
what is the big deal about this one picture ?
honey , you know what ,
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , but-
all right , when you &apos;re a mom ,
everything goes by so quickly .
in a minute , luke &apos;s gonna be shaving ,
and alex is gonna be off at college , and you &apos;re gonna be-
you &apos;ll be doing something great .
i just wanna freeze this moment as it is right now .
you know ?
i do .
i know i don &apos;t show it ,
but this family &apos;s still the most important thing-
screw it .
i &apos;m gonna fix the bastard .
i mean , seriously , how hard can it be ?
if your father can do it , i can do it . right ?
all right .
i just need to ...
lift-
oh , now i see it .
these seats are amazing .
why you have candy coming out of your pocket ?
no , no , no , no , no .
huh ?
i brought my own snacks .
not because i &apos;m cheap . it &apos;s a matter of principle .
plus i get a little rush from the danger .
be cool . be cool .
what ?
be cool . just look straight ahead .
i never felt more alive . whoo !
okay , i just made it worse . i &apos;m not freaking out though .
i &apos;m gonna call your dad , and he &apos;s gonna tell me how to fix this .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s dad .
where ?
right there , behind kobe .
oh , my god !
how weird is this !
quick . quick , tell me something to say that will freak him out .
tell him i &apos;m pregnant .
no , not gonna say that .
okay , here we go . how funny is this !
hey , it &apos;s phil . you know what to do .
well , that was pretty funny .
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh .
it &apos;s much better . excuse me . sorry .
hello ?
there is a pigeon in our house .
what do i do ? what do i do ?
who is this ?
never funny . not funny now .
calm down .
you know i grew up around many animals .
one time , a rooster attacked me ,
and my mom wrung its neck , and we had it for dinner .
great time for an anecdote . help me .
it &apos;s more afraid of you than you are of it .
pigeons aren &apos;t scared of anything .
they stand on electrical wires .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , mitchell . just as long as you don &apos;t-
you know what , they &apos;re starting .
i gotta go . okay , bye .
as long as i don &apos;t what ? cam ?
as long as i don &apos;t- oh , god !
cool . the kiss cam .
wouldn &apos;t it be embarrassing if the camera
was on us and then the crowd started-
we &apos;re related .
not by blood .
touch me and there will be blood .
not us .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
it &apos;s the kiss cam .
when it lands on you , you &apos;re supposed to kiss .
this is my wife &apos;s dad &apos;s second wife .
so legally okay , but still weird .
that was awkward .
and we &apos;re back .
oh . ay ! come on . it &apos;s not a big deal .
thank god for caller i.d.
so you don &apos;t have to talk to your wife .
oh , we &apos;re gonna talk , mister .
we &apos;re gonna talk and talk .
dad , mom saw you on tv . you &apos;re dead .
here &apos;s the thing . the kiss cam is only supposed to be ...
for the enjoyment of the people at the game .
they never show that on tv .
what people do in the privacy of their own sports arena ...
should be their own business .
so in &apos; 66 , i worked in my grandfather &apos;s office supply business-
you know , your ink , your staples , your legal pads .
am i going too fast for you ?
i fell asleep for a second .
did you do anything interesting in the &apos; 60s ?
well , one summer ,
i swept up hair at my other grandfather &apos;s barbershop .
you &apos;re killing me .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t know .
brian beckwith &apos;s grandfather marched on washington .
artie beckwith ?
he couldn &apos;t walk two feet without complaining .
he marched on washington ?
he told brian he did .
with martin luther king jr .
martin luther king ?
guess who cut his hair .
what ?
do you know who cut martin luther king jr . &apos; s hair ?
neither does luke &apos;s teacher .
so the barbershop was in washington ?
okay .
did you cut any other famous hair ?
oh , yeah .
the kennedys , richard nixon , all the astronauts .
how do you think buzz aldrin got his nickname ?
awesome .
* we love to play in lily &apos;s room *
* we don &apos;t need any milk *
okay , you know what , lily ? i am a man .
i am going into the kitchen to get your milk .
* ave maria *
* gratia plena *
* maria , gratia plena *
* maria , gratia plena *
* ave , ave dominus *
* dominus tecum *
* benedicta tu in mulieribus *
* et benedictus fructus ventris *
* ventris tui , jesus *
* ave maria *
then one day , wilt chamberlain shows up .
he says , &quot; can you take a little off the top for my friend here ? &quot;
and it &apos;s elvis .
no way .
greatest singer that ever lived , after sinatra .
i &apos;ll fight any man who says different .
my dad says the greatest singer who ever lived is peabo bryson .
then i guess i gotta fight your dad .
yeah , i guess .
luke says grandpa wants to fight you .
why does everything have to suck ?
let &apos;s just do the picture another day .
i think i &apos;m getting a pimple .
no .
do you know how long it took me to book this photographer ?
maybe by the fireplace .
yeah . that &apos;s a classic old @-@ person spot for a portrait .
yeah , if i &apos;d ever bothered to paint that hideous wall .
claire is a perfectionist , which sometimes is a good thing ,
like when it comes to picking a husband .
sometimes it &apos;s a bad thing ,
like when everyone else sees something beautiful ...
and all she sees is the teeny @-@ tiny flaw .
no . no .
no .
hi . my house is a disaster .
can we do this picture at your place ?
yeah , that &apos;s- that &apos;s not gonna work .
so-
maybe one more layer . and tight , really tight .
dad , can you call them again ?
i just did .
they &apos;re on their way . game went into overtime .
i know , but we &apos;re losing the light ,
and the photographer &apos;s
gotta get to a bar mitzvah in 10 minutes .
oh , red wine . really ? now ?
you know , honey ,
i think you &apos;re getting a little too uptight about this .
it &apos;s hard to breathe .
oh , you &apos;re fine .
what &apos;d you do to him ? he &apos;s turning blue .
but his clothes will stay white .
we &apos;re home !
oh , thank god .
manny , let &apos;s go change .
hey , there &apos;s my beautiful wife .
i know you &apos;re mad at me ,
and i know this foam finger can &apos;t make up for everything .
honey , you just go change ,
and we &apos;ll talk about what you did later .
hey , thank you so much for those tickets .
gloria tells me you had a real good time .
not really . no , i didn &apos;t .
god , i love your daughter .
i should- i should come by
and kiss that step- fix that step .
oh , you &apos;re acting like i wanted to destroy the house .
no . i just think it &apos;s odd
that the majority of things you destroyed ...
were sent to us by my mom .
okay , okay , okay .
so while i &apos;m fighting off that filthy creature ,
i actually stop and say , &quot; oh , you know what ,
here &apos;s the opportunity i &apos;ve always been looking for
to destroy our kitschiest objects . &quot;
kitschiest ? oh , she &apos;s gonna love that .
if you would &apos;ve come with me to the wedding ,
none of this would have happened .
okay . so you are angry .
mitchell , i get it .
you &apos;re terrified of small talk and birds .
you &apos;re just lucky that pigeon
didn &apos;t want to chat you up about the weather .
hello , jay .
hello , guys .
oh , god . oh , you look like the guy from dance fever .
thank you .
deney terrio . cleveland , ohio .
dad , really ? that is not a compliment .
that &apos;s why i wanted you to try those on earlier . turn around .
the picture can &apos;t happen today . my pimple &apos;s getting worse .
oh , honey , i am so sorry . can you stand ?
yeah .
well , then the picture &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s all anybody &apos;s gonna see .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
did you get a look at her dress ?
what ? why would i look at her dress ? i love you .
uh , mrs. dunphy , the sun is setting .
okay . yeah , this is happening .
everybody , come on . let &apos;s go .
be careful . i stained some furniture out there this afternoon .
of course you did , dad .
anything else i need to know about ?
maybe the neighbors on either side are having a paintball fight .
now watch this . dad , in his infinite wisdom ,
stained furniture today .
don &apos;t touch it . it &apos;s wet .
hurry , hurry .
put that down , sweetheart .
okay . okay , we got it . now we &apos;re gonna go out here .
oh , my god ! are you kidding me ?
how do- how do you turn the sprinklers off ?
ay ! of course ! because i &apos;m latina ,
i &apos;m supposed to know everything about gardening and sprinklers !
you were here when they installed it .
ay , yeah . the box is across the yard .
you mean your now @-@ soaking @-@ wet yard ?
that &apos;s great . we are screwed .
no , we &apos;re not .
we haven &apos;t unwrapped our secret weapon yet .
luke walks over there , hurt locker style ...
flips the switch ,
and boom- or not boom- water off .
put the &quot; he &quot; in &quot; hero , &quot; son .
hurt locker ? it &apos;s more like squirt locker .
really ? that wasn &apos;t funny ?
i actually pity you guys .
no time to celebrate ! stop it !
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
all right , everybody .
if i can have the little ones down front-
you know what , sir ?
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;ve got this .
come on , people , let &apos;s get out here .
haley , alex , i need you to unwrap your brother .
all right , i need the dunphys over on this side .
dad , you &apos;re in the middle .
mitchell , cam , lily on this end . okay .
listen .
uh @-@ huh ?
honey , i screwed up , but if ever you &apos;re in my arms again-
phil , not now .
yes , now .
i don &apos;t want to look at this picture ...
when i &apos;m 80 years old and you &apos;re long dead ...
and know that you were angry at me when we took it .
phil , we &apos;ll talk about what you did later .
okay , everybody . eyes over here .
i didn &apos;t do anything . she kissed me .
what ?
who kissed you ?
gloria .
what ?
it was the kiss cam .
why did you kiss cam ?
no , i kissed phil . he told me i had to .
no , no .
okay , hang on a second .
was this before or after
you ignored the phone call from your wife ?
you saw that too ?
could we please just take the damn picture ?
okay . everybody , one more time .
just so you know , i am angry with you .
i knew it !
oh , damn it !
it was a big day for me ,
and he didn &apos;t want to go because he doesn &apos;t like small talk .
would it be terribly inconvenient ...
to just postpone this hissy fit for a few minutes ?
ok , you know what ? maybe some of us don &apos;t
want to take a picture today .
thank you .
and please , claire ,
don &apos;t try to make mitchell do something he doesn &apos;t wanna do .
oh , shut up , cam .
okay , stop it ! stop it !
everyone , listen . this took me forever to put together ,
so i don &apos;t really care
who kissed who and who &apos;s got a pimple on her head ...
and who is wearing an outrageously inappropriate dress .
we are gonna get together and act like a normal family ...
for one @-@ tenth of a freaking second ,
and we &apos;re gonna do it right now .
come on , let &apos;s go .
get your hands off of me .
no . no . make me . make me .
ah , this is ridiculous . you &apos;re both uptight about everything .
you didn &apos;t want to go to a wedding with him
because you didn &apos;t want to make small talk ?
that &apos;s how i met gloria .
do you remember the first thing i said to you ?
yes . &quot; i like chocolate ,
i like fruit , but not together . &quot;
you couldn &apos;t come up with that , lvy league ? and you .
you would be a lot happier if you weren &apos;t
so obsessed with everything being perfect .
look at us here all in white . what are we , a cricket team ?
news flash . life is not perfect , claire .
now calm the hell down .
okay , dad , that &apos;s great , and that &apos;s really easy for you to say .
but do you think i like being like this ?
no , i don &apos;t .
so if you have some quick @-@ and @-@ easy fix ,
why don &apos;t you just give it to me right now ?
jay !
oh , my god .
i- i got this , baby .
no . what did- what did you do ?
now two people are dirty .
well , three .
okay , you know what ?
that &apos;s for &quot; kitschy . &quot;
mud fight !
no . don &apos;t do that . no , no , no ! stop it !
everybody get back in line . come on , guys , stop .
damn it . damn it ! guys !
excuse me .
are we still doing this ?
no . no , we &apos;re not .
now we are .
we &apos;re ready !
say &quot; cheese . &quot;
say &quot; cheese &quot; !
back in &apos; 68 , when i was sweeping up hair in that barbershop ,
i had this mental picture of the family that ,
if i was lucky enough ,
one day i would end up with- perfect wife , perfect kids .
guess what . i didn &apos;t get any of that .
wound up with this sorry bunch .
and i &apos;m thankful for that every day .
well , most days .
i think i &apos;m just gonna go with the elvis stuff .
yeah . i would .
uh , to the right . to the right .
a skosh to the left .
there we go .
whatever . i &apos;m gonna have to take the picture down
when i repaint the wall anyhow .
kill me now .
what ?
don &apos;t know how i got so lucky .
i love you .
i love that picture .
yeah .
is that a chip on the frame right there ?
no . no .
i can see it .
honey .
