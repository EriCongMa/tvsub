yesterday , rachel found your razor in our bathroom .
and i didn &apos;t know what to say
so i said it was mine ,
and that i was playing a woman in a play .
then one thing led to another , and ....
and around the ankles , that is a tough spot .
it was . all right , listen
all this lying has been hard on us too .
yeah , i bet all the sex makes it easier .
yeah , actually .
meanwhile , i get rachel shoving your underwear in my face ...
... and asking when she can come see me star in ugly woman .
we &apos;ll be more careful .
we don &apos;t want them to know because it &apos;s going really well .
and maybe it &apos;s going well because it &apos;s a secret .
it sounds weird , but we &apos;re so bad at relationships .
we are . help us !
help !
all right . but
you do it with me once .
joey !
didn &apos;t think so .
the one with ross &apos; sandwich
can we please just drop this ?
but i don &apos;t get it .
does anybody else just take off their underwear when they &apos;re hot ?
hi phoebe
what are you reading ?
wuthering heights .
i &apos;m taking a literature class at the new school and i have to finish it for the first session tomorrow .
you &apos;re taking a class ? that &apos;s so cool .
i really liked that lamaze class i took .
i thought this time i &apos;d go for something more intellectual ...
... with a less painful final exam .
that sounds like fun .
oh , you should come with me !
then i &apos;ll have someone to sit with .
okay
do you have time to read it ?
i read it in school .
this is going to be so much fun !
okay @-@ shhh , i have to finish .
but what time does the class start ?
what &apos;s wrong , buddy ?
someone at work ate my sandwich .
what did the police say ?
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich.i can &apos;t believe someone ate it .
it &apos;s just a sandwich .
just a sandwich ?
i am 30 years old , okay ? i &apos;ll be divorced twice and i got evicted .
that sandwich was the only good thing in my life !
someone ate the only good thing going on in my life !
that &apos;s a nice sweater vest .
i have enough for one more sandwich .
i was going to eat it myself , but ....
mon , that would be incredible . thank you so much .
i still can &apos;t believe someone ate it !
look , i left a note and everything .
&quot; knock @-@ knock . &quot; &quot; who &apos;s there ? &quot;
&quot; ross geller &apos;s lunch . &quot;
&quot; ross geller &apos;s lunch , who ? &quot;
&quot; ross geller &apos;s lunch . please don &apos;t take me . okay ? &quot;
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t wear it home .
want to keep your food ?
scare people off.i learned that on the street .
really ? what would you say , phoebe ?
stuff like : &quot; keep your mitts off my grub . &quot;
do you picture phoebe on the street with the entire cast of annie ?
this &apos;ll keep them away from your stuff .
phoebe , you are a badass !
someday i &apos;ll tell you how i stabbed the cop .
phoebe
he stabbed me first !
the bronte sisters were remarkable women for their time .
they lived in a patriarchal society .
sorry i &apos;m late , but i left late .
so , what is the book about ?
didn &apos;t you read it in high school ?
i started it , but then there was this pep rally .
and i was on top of the pyramid .
but anyway ... what &apos;s the book about ?
it &apos;s a tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff .
it takes place on these creepy moors in england .
which i think represent the wildness of heathcliff &apos;s character .
i totally get symbolism .
how would you characterize the theme of this book ?
let &apos;s see .... rachel greene ?
i would have to say that it &apos;s a tragic love story .
that &apos;s sort of a given ... but , yes .
... anyone else ?
symbolism !
and the wildness of the moors ... which i think , is mirrored ... in the wildness of heathcliff &apos;s character .
excellent !
what rachel has shrewdly observed here
you completely stole my answer !
honey , that was pretty obvious .
how would you know ? you didn &apos;t read it !
what do you think ?
you in the blue shirt ?
i think that yours is a question with many possible answers .
would you care to venture one ?
would you care to venture one ?
are you just repeating me ?
are you just repeating me ?
all right . let &apos;s move on .
okay , then .
why didn &apos;t you say you hadn &apos;t read the book ?
i didn &apos;t want him to think i was stupid .
that was really embarrassing , what happened to you .
phoebe.-yeah
your note ? amazing !
not only did no one touch my sandwich ... but people at work are actually afraid of me .
a guy called me &quot; mental . &quot; &quot; mental geller . &quot;
i &apos;ve always wanted a cool nickname like that .
the best you got in high school was &quot; wet pants geller . &quot;
it was the water fountain , okay ? !
anyway ... people are writing reports for me pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule .
i tell you , you get tough with people ... and you can get anything you want .
hey , tribbiani ! give me that coffee ! now !
this was really fun .
i &apos;ve been wondering if you &apos;d ask me out .
so you still wondering ?
no . we just went out .
you &apos;re smart.i like that .
oh , candles !
what is that , a blanket ? a video camera ? oh , my god !
no ...
i can &apos;t believe you thought you &apos;d tape us having sex on the first date !
joey , is what she just said ....
oh , my god ! you &apos;re actually going
what is going on here ?
and with chandler in the next room . what are you , sick ?
i &apos;m joey .
i mean , i &apos;m disgusting .
i make low @-@ budget adult films .
you promised to be more careful !
the good joey name &apos;s been dragged through the mud !
we &apos;re so sorry .
i &apos;m telling everyone .
it &apos;s the only explanation that doesn &apos;t make me look like a pig !
no , there &apos;s a better explanation .
tell them you had to make an adult film for your ... adult film class .
i like that .
but no ! how does that explain my underwear at your place ?
i don &apos;t know .
get ready to come out of the non @-@ gay closet .
i promise to come up with something .
just give us time .
all right.but it better make me look really good .
and another thing : the video camera ?
nice !
ross , may i have a word ?
of course , donald .
we &apos;ve been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part .
what ?
threatening letters ... refusal to meet deadlines .
apparently people now call you mental .
we want you to speak to a psychiatrist .
you don &apos;t understand . this is so silly .
this is all just because of a sandwich .
a sandwich ?
you see , my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches .
her secret is , she puts an extra slice of gravy @-@ soaked bread in the middle .
i call it &quot; the moistmaker . &quot;
anyway , i put my sandwich in the fridge ....
oh , you know what ?
i &apos;m sorry.i believe i ate that .
you ate my sandwich ?
a simple mistake . it can happen to anyone .
oh , really ?
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moistmaker ?
no .
do you , perhaps , remember ... seeing a note on top of it ?
there may have been a joke or limerick of some kind .
that said it was ... my sandwich !
now , calm down .
look in my office . some may be in the trash .
what ?
it was quite large .
i had to throw most of it away .
you threw my sandwich away ?
my sandwich ? !
my sandwich ? !
what &apos;s this book about ?
you didn &apos;t read it , either ?
i was going to , but i accidentally read something else .
what ?
vogue .
so tell me about jane eyre .
no , read it yourself .
come on , don &apos;t be such a goody @-@ goody .
fine .
all right . so , jane eyre ? first , you &apos;d think she &apos;s a woman , but she &apos;s not.she &apos;s a cyborg .
a cyborg ? isn &apos;t that like a robot ?
this book was light years ahead of its time .
sorry i &apos;m late . let &apos;s get started .
what did you think of jane eyre ?
rachel and i were discussing it , and she had very interesting insights .
go ahead , rachel .
thank you , phoebe .
what struck me most when reading jane eyre ... was how the book was so ahead of its time .
if you &apos;re talking about feminism , i think you &apos;re right .
well , feminism , yes . but also the robots .
since that video camera thing didn &apos;t work out ...
... i thought that i would give you just a little preview .
you &apos;re naked !
i know !
ross
hi chandler
monica
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i saw a psychiatrist at work today .
why ?
on account of my rage .
which , if i may say , right now is out of control .
he gave me a pill for it .
a pill ?
when the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence ... because i yelled at my boss ,
i started to get worked up again .
so he offered me a tranquilizer .
and i thought it was a good idea .
so i took it .
they &apos;re making you take time off work ?
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s going to be weird not having a job for a while .
but i definitely don &apos;t care about my sandwich .
i hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office .
he &apos;s always like , &quot; your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better . &quot;
who needs that ?
you do .
i know .
it &apos;s so embarrassing ! i can &apos;t believe you let me go on like that !
i &apos;m sorry .
it was so funny when you compared jane eyre to robocop .
that was not funny !
i snapped , okay ?
you weren &apos;t taking the class seriously .
come on ! what is the big deal ?
i thought it &apos;d be something we could do together.i thought it would be fun .
fun is good .
but i also wanted to learn .
people talk about what they learned in high school . i never went .
so you really wanted to learn .
you know , phoebe , i just wanted to have fun .
you know who should go ?
i know ! i know ! i know !
monica , you asked the question .
oh , my god , that &apos;s monica !
no ...
you get away from me , you sick , sick , sicko !
what &apos;s going on ?
joey has got a secret peephole !
oh , no !
yes , he has a naked picture of monica !
he takes naked pictures of us ,
then he eats chicken and looks at them !
oh ! dude , that &apos;s my sister !
give me that ! wait ! everybody calm down , okay ?
let &apos;s give our friend a chance to explain why he &apos;s such a big pervert !
i am not a pervert , okay ?
it &apos;s just .... i just kind of ....
i think i can explain this .
thank you .
joey &apos;s a sex addict .
what ? ! no , i &apos;m not !
it &apos;s okay ! it &apos;s good !
it &apos;s a disease .
i am not a sex addict !
yes , you are !
that &apos;s the only way to explain all this stuff !
no , it isn &apos;t . it &apos;s not .
because you could also explain it with the truth !
what is the truth ?
what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i slept with monica .
well , let &apos;s see what everybody thinks of that .
you slept with my sister ?
yes , but it was we just did it once , in london .
this is not good for my rage .
monica , is this true ?
of course , it &apos;s true .
how else would you explain all the weird stuff that &apos;s been going on ?
yes , it &apos;s true .
if it happened once ,
how come we found your underwear in our apartment ?
that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london.right , monica ?
i guess i wanted to keep it ... as a souvenir .
my god , monica !
are you sure you &apos;re not just a sex addict ?
if anyone &apos;s a sex addict here , it &apos;s monica .
she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london !
that &apos;s why she gave you a naked picture of herself .
that makes sense .
and the video camera ?
monica ?
i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey .
but , sadly , i could not be enticed .
monica , this has to stop now .
i know , i know.i know . i will , ...
and i would appreciate if we all could just ... drop it immediately , and forever .
okay . that is , if you can resist me .
i &apos;ll give it my best shot .
good luck .
unbelievable ! you really kept joey &apos;s underwear ?
why ? why would you do that ?
i &apos;m monica .
i &apos;m disgusting .
i stalk guys and keep their underpants .
i think we &apos;ve all learned who &apos;s disgusting and who &apos;s not .
now , i &apos;m going to get back to my bucket .
i &apos;m only eating the skin , so the chicken &apos;s up for grabs .
you were making a good point .
i mean , till you got cut off .
what &apos;s up with that girl monica ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t come with her .
hey , everybody ! everybody , guess what !
i just convinced carl to give us a test .
test ?
come on ! tests make us all better learners !
