over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
dude , there must &apos;ve been hundreds of thousands of people there .
that was crazy .
man , it was epic .
the word is epic .
dude , they host this festival every year .
the next one is in buenos aires .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m in . like , a hundred thousand percent .
we got to go every year .
yo , have you seen the girls here ?
they &apos;ll never go for us .
oh , yeah ?
here .
this &apos;ll help loosen you up .
meow meow . it &apos;s like ecstasy .
oh , no . i don &apos;t know .
dude , that whole party was rollin &apos; -- live a little .
no , but how do you even know that &apos;s what they say it is ?
&apos;cause the guy spoke english .
will , we &apos;re in india .
cut loose , have some fun .
what do you think ?
her friend &apos;s cute .
come on !
you are such an idiot .
all right .
you only yolo once .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about .
excuse me , how do ...
excuse me , is -- is any--
i need help !
someone help me , please .
help me , please .
this is backed by cold , hard science .
india has one of the most specialized flavor profiles
of any cuisine in the world .
you don &apos;t like indian food ?
i don &apos;t think it likes me .
well , it &apos;s an acquired taste , like you .
you just don &apos;t know where to eat -- i will take you .
okay . let &apos;s go .
monty , what &apos;ve you got ?
namaste .
americans will duncan and tommy moses
were having the time of their lives in mumbai
until 24 hours ago , when they fell off the grid .
no cell phone , no credit card charges ,
but i found this video on social media .
early this morning , will duncan
was found facedown in an alley in dharavi .
it &apos;s one of the largest slums in india .
he was attacked , and his kidney was removed .
he &apos;s currently in the hospital fighting for his life .
his friend tommy moses is still missing .
both were college students
in mumbai for the holy shake edm festival .
the bizarre nature of the attack has the u.s. consulate
terrified at the prospect of more americans being targeted .
it says here they processed thousands of visas
in the last month , all in connection with the festival .
with tommy missing and will &apos;s attackers at large ,
they &apos;ve asked us to investigate
and prepare a threat assessment .
you know , mumbai is known for transplant tourism ,
where rich foreigners come to buy organs from india &apos;s poor .
sounds like an urban legend , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s actually an elaborate market
that involves brokers , forgers ,
and human trafficking of live donors .
hotch &apos;s team was involved in a sting
in new york city in 2009 .
i think they arrested an organ broker .
yeah , he was selling organs
to americans for upwards of 100 grand .
and we have no question of demand .
in most countries , an organ
can only be donated between family members
or received via the transplant registry .
is it possible that will
voluntarily sold his kidney to make some cash ?
it seems unlikely .
he paid for the festival passes and the plane tickets himself .
by all accounts , these were two kids just
looking to have a good time .
because of the removal of the kidney ,
we have to operate under the assumption
that both will and tommy
were targeted and drawn into the black market organ trade .
when we land , i want us running this from all angles ,
how they were taken ...
who performed the surgery ...
the organ broker who sold will &apos;s kidney .
good . we need to hit the ground running .
tommy &apos;s life depends on it .
第一季 第二集
&quot; let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers ,
but to be fearless in facing them .
let me not beg for the stilling of my pain ,
but for the heart to conquer it . &quot;
r. tagore .
okay . some things to keep in mind --
politeness is politic .
never use someone &apos;s first name without their consent ,
never refuse hospitality ,
and never initiate physical contact with someone
of the opposite sex .
even something as innocuous as a handshake
can be looked upon as a sexual advance .
hey , i can only control myself ,
not how others respond to me .
mr. singh , good to see you .
ah , deepak , please .
welcome .
you remember agents simmons ...
welcome .
and jarvis , and , uh , ssa clara seger ,
who &apos;s rejoined us after a short absence .
wonderful to see you .
our apologies for pulling you
away from your family &apos;s wedding preparations .
anything for an old friend .
now , for convenience &apos;s sake , i have arranged for us
to work with the mumbai police on site .
they have a security tent
set up near the entrance to the festival .
so we &apos;ll start there , pick up your honor guard and weapons .
what do you make of the case ?
i think we are looking for some very dangerous men .
these organ traders
have become particularly brazen in recent years .
they pose as aid workers and prey on communities
that have been devastated by natural disasters .
people who &apos;ve lost everything ?
these brokers promise them riches to rebuild their lives ,
but it never turns out that way .
shall we ?
don &apos;t be afraid to let your neighbor know you are here .
remind me again , how did you two meet ?
2008 , here in mumbai .
later , i attended the fbi national academy at jack &apos;s invitation .
the courses - at quantico were invaluable .
i got monty on speaker . what do you got , monty ?
according to cell phone tower records ,
will and tommy &apos;s last known location was shivaji park .
the site of the festival . we are headed there now .
neither cell phone is currently active .
thanks , monty .
you know , out of 1,000 possible victims in the vicinity ,
why take two americans like will and tommy ?
availability and opportunity .
in india , all organs are not equal .
it &apos;s a question of blood type .
most of the indian subcontinent is b @-@ positive ,
so finding a local match that is o @-@ negative is more difficult .
hospital records show no evidence of abuse or sexual assault ,
though will had drugs and alcohol in his system .
well , let &apos;s assume tommy did , as well .
the drugs could &apos;ve incapacitated them .
could &apos;ve also compromised their organs .
could imply an urgency or inexperience
on the part of their attackers .
why take only one organ ?
it &apos;d be more profitable to take more .
yeah , but more to the point ,
why even stitch will up and dump him at all ?
so where &apos;s tommy ?
can i help you , young sir ?
you have the most best beautiful eyes , little lad .
blue , like gods .
you want to see a rickshaw ?
yeah , sure .
come .
you want to sit inside ? go .
this is how you start it .
aiden ?
see ?
right here .
aiden !
aiden !
what the hell are you doing ?
come on .
inspector shan is one of our very best officers .
i &apos;m sure - you will work well together .
and constable irfan is as sharp as they come .
mae , head to the hospital .
talk to will and his doctors . find out what he remembers .
simmons , talk to the festival organizers .
this site was will and tommy &apos;s last known location .
see what you can learn about the moments
leading up to their abduction .
you got it .
monty , you with us ?
always .
any updates on prior attacks or crimes
in the region that fit this level of brutality ?
uh , still working on it ,
but i have been searching hashtags ,
blog posts , and news feeds surrounding the festival .
it &apos;s day 3 of 4 .
if anyone &apos;s seen anything out of the ordinary
and tweeted about it , i &apos;ll find it .
great . deepak , i &apos;d like you to take clara and i
to the neighborhood where will was found .
yes . they call it kidneyville .
kidneyville ?
yes , that &apos;s the name the locals have given it .
but i must warn you , it &apos;s not safe .
if you could spare a few more men ,
i &apos;d like to canvass
and interview possible witnesses .
okay .
that was a 6 @-@ hour flight on a moment &apos;s notice .
i told him india was a mistake .
okay . what happened ? on the phone ,
they would only tell us that will was in trouble .
there was an incident .
will is in surgery now .
he was attacked in mumbai . he &apos;s in serious condition .
oh , no .
oh , my -- - janice , oh , my god .
i want you to know that our team is there now ,
and they are going to do everything they can
to get the boys home .
i need to ask you a few questions about will and tommy .
would that be all right ?
i &apos;m the festival organizer , and i &apos;m telling you ,
this is a party , not a police state .
we &apos;re not here to surveil the attendees &apos; every move .
but the bar @-@ coded security bracelets ,
they are able to track all movement in and out of the festival ?
yes , yes .
so we need you to provide us with any information
you can regarding will and tommy &apos;s movement .
when was the last time their bracelets
were scanned for entry and exit ,
are they still active , that kind of a thing .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you know , this park is the largest in mumbai .
it &apos;s a cradle of indian cricket .
now , it &apos;s just being trampled on .
all the greats have trained right here .
like sachin tendulkar ?
you know cricket , sir ?
here in kidneyville ,
entire families are coerced into selling their kidneys .
most suffer from complications
that render them unable to work
and in more debt than before .
how much does one go for ?
maybe $ 6,000 u.s.
that could feed an entire family for years .
if they get the money .
most only ever receive a portion .
this place is like a maze .
there &apos;s no clear path in or out , very little room for a vehicle ,
much less foot traffic .
will &apos;s attackers would &apos;ve had to move quickly
to avoid being caught .
which means will and possibly tommy were being held here .
our unsub is a local .
well , with 1 million people per one square mile ,
it &apos;d be like looking for a needle in a haystack .
modern india loves to pretend this doesn &apos;t exist ,
but this is our surviving legacy .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits , as they are known ,
still face ostracism and violence almost daily .
many in india see them as something less than human .
change is not easy .
it takes good leadership .
the longer we stay here , the more attention we will draw .
things could go badly .
having given the volume of people
and the fact there are multiple full entry and exit gates ,
this is the perfect hunting ground .
according to our records , will and tommy
left the festival at 2 : 17 a.m. the previous night ,
and both bracelets were scanned within seconds of each other .
well , if they left together ,
it could mean they were abducted at the same time .
tommy &apos;s bracelet was just scanned for entry
into the vip lounge .
whoever has the badge could be our guy .
you &apos;ve been armed ?
yeah .
let &apos;s go .
okay .
we &apos;ll be right up .
will &apos;s dead .
they want us to come claim the body .
the guy in the hoodie .
police .
tommy ?
surgeons often have signatures ,
how they cut , ligate , suture , et cetera .
so it might be possible to tell who performed
will &apos;s surgery by looking ...
these cuts are crude , ragged , unskilled .
there &apos;s no way that they were done by a medical professional .
based on how poorly excised the side is ,
i would doubt that the organ is even viable for transplant .
i mean , it &apos;s a $ 1.2 billion industry .
no doctor is ever gonna be this sloppy .
yes , but most people would not know where to even begin .
oh , looks like a needle prick , perhaps an injection site .
he could be drugging them .
if this attempt is so badly botched , it pretty much
guarantees that the attacker &apos;s gonna find another victim .
all right . thanks , simmons .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a flier looking for kidney donors .
the symbols for the different blood types caught my eye .
they don &apos;t even try to hide the exploitation .
you know , i &apos;ve been all over the world ,
and places like this , they just --
never gets easier .
so what &apos;s the latest ?
good news and bad news .
tommy &apos;s alive .
simmons found him at the festival .
turns out that he and will went their separate ways
after leaving the party that night .
let me guess , he met a girl .
earlier in the day , his cell phone and wallet
were stolen by a pickpocket .
so tommy spent the last 24 hours partying
and had no idea if will was in trouble or missing ?
which brings me to the bad news .
will &apos;s dead .
his heart failed during surgery .
mae doesn &apos;t think we &apos;re looking for a doctor .
someone with medical knowledge ,
but not a professional .
maybe someone looking to get into the trade .
we &apos;ve got to find that organ broker .
deepak , who &apos;s the guy watching us from the car ?
the mafia , just like the godfather .
they practically run the slums .
they tolerate law enforcement , but only just .
they &apos;re the ones that most likely put up the fliers .
if we &apos;re gonna find this broker , we have to do it soon .
what are you thinking ?
jack , what are you doing ?
jack , this is very unsafe .
i want to talk to your boss .
jack , i cannot allow this .
i &apos;m unarmed .
the last thing you want me to do
is bring the full force of the u.s. government down here .
just you .
jack , listen ...
just me . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ll see you back at the tent .
get in .
you asked to speak with me ?
no , i asked to speak with the boss .
not who you imagined ?
i &apos;ve seen you and your woman walking the streets of dharavi .
what is it you hope to find ?
justice .
a young american man is dead ,
abducted from your streets ,
pulled into the black market organ trade .
i want to know who &apos;s responsible .
i am a businesswoman .
street crime is not my concern .
the boy &apos;s kidney was harvested .
i think you know who &apos;s responsible .
i think there &apos;s very little
that happens here that you don &apos;t know .
nothing happens in dharavi without my knowledge .
then you &apos;ve got a problem .
one of your men is striking out on their own ,
only their carelessness
and lack of skill has already left one person dead .
i would never do business with someone so sloppy .
no ?
no .
my greatest commodity is my people .
so the services you provide ,
the transplants you negotiate ,
they &apos;re all done by professionals ?
the buyers are arranged months in advance .
not only would such a man
not be able to sell a kidney stolen in such a hasty manner ,
but he &apos;d face my wrath .
and people here are not afraid of the law .
they are afraid of me .
so it sounds like we both want this guy caught .
i am sorry .
i do not have anything more to offer .
it &apos;s not just bad business that you need to be worried about .
if i have to come back here ,
if another american dies , i won &apos;t be alone .
and here i thought the enemy of my enemy was my friend .
could you take a photo of me ?
s @-@ sure .
come closer , closer .
come see . there &apos;s too much light .
what the hell ?
what are you doing ?
you want money ?
my family is rich .
we have more money - than you could ever dream of .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! no , no , no , no !
please !
there &apos;s no way that hasina &apos;s involved .
she wouldn &apos;t risk tainting her own supply lines .
all right . so we &apos;re lookin &apos; for someone
who &apos;s workin &apos; on the fringes ,
doing so with great risk to themselves .
speaks to their desperation .
so if we &apos;re not looking to organized crime ,
and we &apos;ve ruled out a corrupt doctor or surgeon ...
then we &apos;re looking for an individual .
jack , there &apos;s another victim .
the emt said he &apos;s heavily sedated but stable ,
so they should be good to move him as soon as the road clears .
he was at the festival .
yeah .
both of his eyes were removed ,
and there are signs that his wrists were restrained .
well , he didn &apos;t take the kidney .
look here .
that &apos;s a puncture mark .
that &apos;s the same as will .
i think it &apos;s an injection site .
ah , if he &apos;s using drugs to subdue them ,
that mean &apos;s he &apos;s able to lure them into his playing field
with some kind of a ruse .
well , whatever he used to remove them was crude and blunt .
there &apos;s significant damage to the ocular cavities .
yeah . this is an ugly escalation .
i mean , his eyes have been removed
even more crudely than will &apos;s kidney .
yeah . and also , there is no such thing as a whole @-@ eye transplant .
just the cornea .
yeah . and given that the unsub
didn &apos;t even attempt to take zak &apos;s kidney ,
i mean , maybe he &apos;s trying to make a statement .
something about the influx of foreigners at the festival ?
oh , maybe . but what worries me
is the timetable , a lack of a cooling @-@ off period
and the fact that the festival is in full swing
for another night .
it all but guarantees he will strike again .
we are looking for a man from dharavi between the ages
of 25 to 45 whom we &apos;d most likely consider to be
a power reassurance offender .
which means his intention is to harm but not kill .
this man will have low self @-@ esteem
and a low social standing .
we think that the unsub wants his victims to live .
he took the time to suture will &apos;s incision
and to bandage zak &apos;s eyes ,
and these are acts of remorse and guilt .
he dumped both victims in locations where they would be
found so that the damage he inflicted might be rectified .
however , the brutality on display in his latest attack
points toward a looming devolution that will only
make him more dangerous .
and he is fixated on the festival .
yes . it provides anonymity .
as a local , he can move to and from
without drawing attention .
and the festival may be the source of his rage .
based on the organs he took ,
we believe the unsub may be trying to make a statement .
and based on the function
of the kidneys and the eyes in the body ,
perhaps he &apos;s lashing out at the toxicity
and blindness of the tourists here at the edm festival .
our unsub is familiar with the area
and confident to dump his bodies right in the open .
our local pd should review all complaints or threats
they &apos;ve received - leading up to the festival .
it &apos;s crucial that we keep up the canvassing of dharavi .
lean on any sources you have .
our unsub has medical knowledge
and access to medical equipment like the syringe
and the drugs that he uses to subdue his victims ,
so let &apos;s look at males in the medical field
who have a criminal record .
we need to narrow in on his abduction ruse .
he &apos;s not done killing ,
and we have to find a way to stop him .
why is it so hot here ?
all this walking is killing my feet .
and seriously , can a girl get a cheeseburger ?
like , a turkey burger ?
oh , i got it .
i &apos;m complaining ,
and you &apos;re literally helping old ladies .
look , i &apos;ll go get us a taxi .
no more walking .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know why you put up with me .
i &apos;ll be right back .
need taxi ? sir , right here .
yeah .
going to holihake , huh ?
let me take you .
thanks .
hey , monty . what &apos;s up ?
i just got a hit on social media .
a girl named irene from abilene , texas ,
tweeted an hour ago that her boyfriend went missing .
what do you think ? too early to sound the alarm ?
no , i don &apos;t think we can dismiss anything at this point .
i &apos;ll contact her and send you the info .
okay , great .
so you were in mumbai for the festival
and then planned on traveling around india for a month ?
yeah . travis is a volunteer .
he helps provide free medical care .
his shift was about to start , so he went to get us a taxi
because my feet hurt .
he texted me to meet him at the ...
what do you call those weird little cars with three wheels ?
an auto rickshaw .
but when i went over there , he was gone .
did you actually see him get inside a vehicle .
no . but he would never just leave .
it &apos;s totally out of character .
i &apos;m a mess .
he always takes care of me .
the place was packed with festival @-@ goers and tourists .
it &apos;s about halfway between the slums and the festival itself .
there was hostels , shops , bars .
and what do you want to bet that zak was registered
at a hostel nearby ?
and he &apos;s using an auto rickshaw to abduct them .
well , taking into account the festival ,
the point of abduction outside the hostel ,
and the two dump sites , our unsub &apos;s comfort zone
stretches less than a half a square mile .
it &apos;s not marked , but there &apos;s a hospital right here .
maahir care .
i could get my men to pull the personnel records ,
but , uh , in mumbai , so much is still done by hand .
it would be faster to send someone .
we &apos;re on it .
mae , go through the department &apos;s motor vehicle records .
the auto rickshaw is central to his ruse .
let &apos;s see if we can find him through that .
okay . monty , can you help us
by pulling some plates from the traffic cameras ?
sure can .
and we need to focus our search in the southernmost zone ,
keep up the canvassing .
there are over 60,000 interlocking structures .
something &apos;s bothering me .
why isn &apos;t the unsub dumping the bodies near the festival ?
it seems like a contradiction .
i @-@ if it &apos;s about making a statement , who &apos;s it for ?
so you &apos;re saying , why leave the victims in kidneyville ?
i &apos;m saying , why not just kill them ?
why take the organs at all ?
mm , maybe it &apos;s about the body parts and not the victims .
maybe he &apos;s building
his own twisted version of frankenstein &apos;s monster .
what if this isn &apos;t about making a statement ?
the damage done to zak was aggressive ,
up close and personal .
if i didn &apos;t know any better ,
i would &apos;ve thought he knew his victims .
yeah . making the choice to cut someone up like this is so intimate ,
so specific .
this could be personal in a different way .
he could be trying to shine a spotlight
on some personal loss he &apos;s suffered .
maybe it &apos;s about revenge , an eye for an eye .
literally . kidney and corneal transplants
are two of the top organs transplanted worldwide ,
so even if they &apos;re not being taken for transplant purposes ,
maybe there is something to the organ trade
being at the center of all this .
you know i don &apos;t believe in coincidences .
well , some hindus
reject the concept of organ donation
because they don &apos;t believe a body should move on
to the next life incomplete .
maybe the unsub is rushing to complete
or make someone whole
before he cremates them .
it &apos;s the responsibility of the eldest son .
the hospital releases the body to the families
so that they can wash and prepare the body for cremation .
that &apos;s it .
we thought the festival was the trigger .
it wasn &apos;t . it was an opportunity .
based on his victim selection ,
we &apos;re looking for someone who &apos;s lost a male figure .
potentially a brother or a father .
monty , can you access hospital records
for recent transplants or deaths involving locals
within the unsub &apos;s comfort zone ?
uh , how recent ?
traditionally , hindu funeral rites take place within 48 hours .
it &apos;s already been 2 days .
he &apos;s running out of time . monty ?
i &apos;m working my magic here , but i &apos;m coming up empty .
these records simply aren &apos;t online .
so why wouldn &apos;t he take
all the organs from the first victim ?
well , if it &apos;s a question of karma ,
perhaps he &apos;s cherry @-@ picking the victims ,
hoping to give them a better chance in the next life .
will wore glasses . he had poor eyesight .
zak had blue eyes , fair skin .
in india , this is most desirable ,
a lineage of colonialism .
it &apos;s an indication of status .
the unsub would want the healthiest kidneys ,
the best eyes .
so in his mind , when this loved one is reincarnated ,
he will come back in a higher caste .
i &apos;m sorry , jack ,
but i cannot access these patient files .
but i can tell you , via pharmacy records ,
that immunosuppressants were prescribed .
the transplants took place at maahir care ,
the hospital within the unsub &apos;s comfort zone ,
but i cannot tell you who the donors were .
there &apos;s only one person who can get us that answer .
turns out that there are
over 300,000 auto rickshaws in this city .
monty helped us pull some plates from a traffic camera
in the area to help narrow the search .
now , most drivers can &apos;t afford to purchase a vehicle .
they rent them at a day rate .
so we reached out to the rental agencies
to see if we could find a match ,
and we got a hit -- um , a driver , mahal sabah .
he missed his payment the last 2 days ,
and he hasn &apos;t returned the vehicle .
the owner said , until 2 days ago ,
he had not missed a payment in 20 years .
i mean , what are the odds ?
do you have an address ?
inspector shah - and i are looking for it now .
the rental agencies didn &apos;t have it ,
and most of the p.d. &apos; s files are not online ,
so we are searching for it manually .
so i know the rickshaw is part of his ruse ,
but what if this guy &apos;s an emt ?
ambulance drivers here are employed by private firms ,
and they have regular access to the hospital
and the festival site , or vice versa .
that would explain the access to medical equipment .
follow up on the private firm
and run down their personal records .
you got it .
i did not expect to see you again ,
certainly not without your big american cavalry .
i thought about what you said .
perhaps we can work together .
after all , my unfinished business is also yours .
you told me nothing happens in this slum
without your knowledge ,
and that people are your greatest commodity .
you work with what you have , and so do they .
i give them a chance at a future .
and that &apos;s why you handle things yourself .
you &apos;re protective of them .
two days ago , you brokered a transplant at maahir care ,
two corneas and a kidney .
where did the organs come from ?
where ?
from no one , a dalit .
well , that man is the one who is making a fool of you .
someone in his family is responsible for
the death of an innocent american .
i want a name
so that my team can stop him before he kills again .
two days ago , hasina brokered a series of
last @-@ minute transplants -- a kidney , two corneas ...
and a heart .
yes . how &apos;d you know ?
travis is a volunteer , he takes care of his girlfriend .
he &apos;s kind , has a good soul .
the organs came from the same man , mahal sabah .
that &apos;s the missing rickshaw driver .
he was brought into the hospital for dehydration
and pronounced dead a short time later .
there have been reports of this .
a dalit goes into a hospital with a curable illness
but ends up dead .
the doctors take advantage of the situation
and sell the organs to the highest bidder .
taking advantage is too kind .
mahal &apos;s son is an ambulance driver ,
and he &apos;s the one who brought him in .
samraj sabah . that &apos;s our guy .
he must &apos;ve been using his father &apos;s vehicle
for the abductions .
okay , i &apos;ve got him . - no address , just a postal code ,
400017 .
that &apos;s dharavi .
there are no formal street addresses in dharavi ,
but the slums have organized
an informal community mail service .
they &apos;ve been mapping the area for the past couple years .
we &apos;ve worked out a deal
so that they share their records
in exchange for police protection .
all right . monty , we &apos;re gonna need
the most recent satellite imagery .
if we can compare that with these local maps ,
it should give us a pretty good idea of what we &apos;re walking into .
we need to go in strategically .
travis &apos; safety is our number @-@ one concern .
gasoline . everyone get back .
don &apos;t move !
if he takes that shot , it could ignite that room .
we need to get fire trucks here immediately .
there &apos;s a unit in dharavi .
this whole block will go up .
i just wanted to give him better life .
he has suffered enough .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
this doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i could not let him go without good heart .
he deserves that .
he does .
he deserved kindness ,
but so does he .
they treated my father like he was nothing ,
worth more dead than alive .
they cut him up like he was not even man ,

spare parts for the rich .
in death ,
he shall live again .

did you know dharavi is completely green ?
the slums recycle the plastics they scavenge .
they melt them down into different figurines and toys .

it suits you .
it suits all of us .
