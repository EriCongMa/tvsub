hey , would you like to hear some songs i &apos;ve rewritten
to get children interested in the hard sciences ?
sure .
really ?
yeah . well , i like music , i like science ,
i like making fun of sheldon . hit it .
* there was a scientist who had a theory *
还有拍手跳过音的小游戏
* and james clerk maxwell was his name @-@ o *
* j @-@ a @-@ m @-@ e @-@ s *
* c @-@ l @-@ e @-@ r @-@ k *
* space m @-@ a @-@ x @-@ w @-@ e @-@ l @-@ l *
* and james clerk maxwell was his name @-@ o *
* there was a scientist who had a theory *
* and james clerk maxwell was his name @-@ o *
* a @-@ m @-@ e @-@ s *
uh , okay , okay . uh , we @-@ we get it .
perhaps you &apos;d prefer this one .
* the itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all *
开头两句与 《 蝴蝶蝴蝶真美丽 》 一样
* because it has eight legs *
* and two body parts *
that &apos;s pretty cool , sheldon .
thank you .
do either of you know beyonce ?
i &apos;d love her to get behind it .
you guys know the new discovery class missions
that nasa &apos;s been working on ?
yeah .
发现计划 新疆界计划 探索计划 旗舰计划
well , they &apos;re looking to include a message from earth
in case one of them is encountered by alien life .
when i encountered alien life , i @-@ i discovered
that the key thing was not to sit in its spot .
all right , you can &apos;t breathe our air without an inhaler ,
he &apos;s allergic to earth nuts ,
but i &apos;m the alien .
anyway , i &apos;m among a handful of scientists
that have been asked to submit a design proposal
for the message and its delivery system .
excellent .
congratulations .
and i was wondering if any of you guys
would like to help me do it .
are you kidding ? yes . what did you have in mind ?
i &apos;ll tell you exactly what you should do :
avoid the presumption of the terran sensory input paradigm .
yeah , absolutely .
you need a device capable of delivering information
across a wide range of perceptual modalities .
any intelligent organism would at the very least need
the ability to locate the position of objects in space .
so the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic .
ooh , how about a 3 @-@ d tactile communicator rigged
for cross @-@ sensory transposition ?
exactly what i expected .
two people forcing their ideas on me
and only one gentleman who could be bothered
to ask me what my thoughts were .
you two are out . congratulations , leonard ,
you &apos;re on the team .
my mommy raised a gentleman .
hey . thanks for coming by .
yeah . i &apos;m excited to help .
i would have included the others , but ...
you know exactly what would &apos;ve happened .
they would &apos;ve taken over the project and bossed us around .
i get it .
uh , just this morning ,
sheldon wouldn &apos;t let me put almond milk on my grape @-@ nuts
其实并不含任何浆果或坚果
because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict .
you should have told him to mind his own business .
yeah . that &apos;s better than what i did say , which was ,
&quot; fine , i &apos;ll eat them with club soda . &quot;
what makes them think they &apos;re always in charge of everything ?
mmm , they &apos;re alpha males .
what does that make us ?
we could be betas . they &apos;re second in charge .
okay , that sounds good .
or we could be omegas .
they get pushed around by the alphas and the betas .
okay , that sounds like us .
whatever . there &apos;s no alphas here ,
and this is your project .
you &apos;re in charge . how do you want to start ?
i don &apos;t know . how do you want to start ?
i don &apos;t know .
should we call sheldon and howard ?
no . we can do this by ourselves .
okay . great . how do you want to start ?
i don &apos;t know . how do you want to start ?
sheldon .
sheldon .
sheldon .
i bet that started off as a joke ,
but by the third one you realized
there was something strangely enjoyable about it .
yeah , i kind of want to do it again .
i don &apos;t recommend it . you &apos;ll be doing it the rest of your life .
anyway , if you &apos;re looking for leonard , he &apos;s with koothrappali .
uh , no , i actually came to talk to you .
how nice .
here are some topics that interest me :
quantum mechanics , trains , flags ...
no , no . it &apos;s about my acting career .
oh , sorry .
that &apos;s not on the list .
oh , wait . no .
how about we split the difference
and discuss why austria was an archduchy
and not just a regular duchy .
okay , look , here &apos;s the thing .
i like pharmaceutical sales--it &apos;s going great--
but i have an audition for a movie ,
and if i get it , it could screw everything up .
i know exactly what you should do .
unfortunately , i cannot tell you .
well , why ?
i &apos;m attempting to turn over a new leaf .
earlier today , it was pointed out to me
that i tend to force my ideas on people .
you &apos;re really not gonna tell me ?
no , that train has left the station .
now , we can play this one of two ways .
you can say , &quot; trains , tell me more , &quot;
or ...
you can just look at me like that
and i &apos;ll start .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
i am making molecular cocktails .
this sphere is actually a cosmopolitan .
how do you drink it ?
oh , just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit .
i think i &apos;ll have a beer .
first take a picture with me .
why ?
well , raj and i always talked about learning
how to make cocktails like this together ,
so i taught myself and i &apos;m putting this on instagram
so he can see it and feel like a turd .
say cheese .
is this about the space probe he &apos;s working on without you ?
you betcha . the very one .
howard , you &apos;re grown men .
you guys don &apos;t have to do everything together .
i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m spending tonight with you .
trying to hurt raj &apos;s feelings .
with my honeybunch .
you &apos;re being childish .
no . he is .
so i have a dominant personality .
we all know that .
i &apos;m sorry . what do we know ?
in social groupings ,
i just naturally wind up in charge .
don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but how many of these little booze balls have you had ?
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a leader ?
i was kidding . of course you are .
right . i couldn &apos;t change if i wanted to .
you better not change , because i love who you are .
now , will you need help cleaning all this up when you &apos;re done
or can you do it all by yourself ?
all by myself .
there &apos;s my big boss man .
so , often on the front of the locomotive
is a large iron wedge
for clearing objects off the tracks .
now , while commonly known as a cowcatcher ,
i prefer the more accurate &quot; cow exploder . &quot;
是为了把铁轨上散步的牛或障碍赶走
okay . sheldon , let me ask you a question .
if i was at a train station
and one train could take me to my current job
and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie ,
which train should i get on ?
are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice ?
no .
all right , then .
you should take a third train
where you audition for the movie
but hold off on making a career decision
until you have more information .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m worried about something that hasn &apos;t even happened yet .
you are a wise man .
well , penny , who &apos;s smarter : the wise man
or the person who comes to him for advice ?
oh , i guess you &apos;re right .
maybe it is the person who asks .
no , it &apos;s the wise man .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s called the wise man .
you know how i know that ?
i &apos;m the wise man .
i &apos;m sorry . what was i thinking ?
uh , just out of curiosity ,
why didn &apos;t you ask leonard for advice about this ?
&apos;cause i already know what he &apos;ll say .
&quot; wah , wah , wah , you shouldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
it &apos;s just like he &apos;s here !
okay , so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space ,
like the golden record on voyager ,
were heavily criticized .
well , aliens could only play the golden record
if they figured out how to build a record player .
although , to be fair , i watched e.t. build a telephone
out of a speak &amp; spell and an umbrella .
dude was like a little brown macgyver .
擅长用普通生活用品作为工具
that would be more helpful if e.t. were real .
well , my feelings were real when he was about to die .
my god , when he &apos;s on the table and they use the paddles on him .
and he &apos;s all white .
they zip him up in that bag .
and gertie can &apos;t stop crying .
the flower dies .
okay , let &apos;s talk about something else.- all right .
so it @-@ it sounds like we need a way to communicate that &apos;s simple .
and doesn &apos;t require outside machinery
to be built to access it .
it &apos;s also a problem because we don &apos;t even know
if the aliens who find this can see .
i mean , they might communicate
in a totally different way than us .
like when my dog is mad at me ,
she tells me by peeing in my slippers .
that &apos;s actually a valid example .
animals do deliver messages through scent .
bees talk to each other by dancing .
whales have their songs .
penny has about 20 different ways of rolling her eyes
that each mean something different .
okay , so , what it sounds like is ,
what we want is a device
that can deliver a message through not only sight ,
but other senses , as well .
the most basic sense that any space @-@ faring civilization
would have to possess is touch .
we could make a video @-@ playing device
that simultaneously translates the information
into a tactile medium .
all we have to do is rig up a 3 @-@ d communication system !
we @-@ we can totally do that !
i know !
this is great !
yeah , you know what else it is ?
what ?
exactly what sheldon and howard said .
well , thank you for peeing in my slippers .
* it &apos;s the eye of the tiger *
* it &apos;s the ear of the bat *
* it &apos;s the whiskers of the catfish *
* and the walrus ... *
hang on . not that your song isn &apos;t terrible-- it is ...
... but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar ?
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
* and also regarding the bat *
* it has sonar . *
hello .
look ,
i know you guys are upset , but we &apos;ve talked about it ,
and we think it &apos;d be beneficial
for you to be part of the project .
well , well , well , did you hear that , sheldon ?
i &apos;m sorry . i was trying to think of what rhymes
with &quot; nose of the aardvark . &quot;
we want you back on the project with us .
well , well , well , did you hear that , howard ?
look , we admit it .
the idea that you guys came up with was really good ,
and i &apos;d love your help .
i suppose it couldn &apos;t have been easy for you to say that .
it wasn &apos;t , so ... are you in ?
certainly .
sure .
great .
now that we &apos;re all on the same page ,
let &apos;s get together tonight and work on it .
&quot; get together tonight &quot; ?
leonard , stop trying to control everything ,
and give poor raj a chance to come up with what we should do .
go ahead , raj .
okay , i think we should do it right now .
tonight works better for me .
okay .
okay , it &apos;s just an audition .
why am i nervous ?
maybe it &apos;s a good thing .
just means i want it .
and i can have it .
this feels right .
why did i ever give this up ?
i &apos;m starting to remember .
so , i &apos;d like to try a technique
where no one gets steamrolled .
when you talk ,
instead of bringing up a new idea ,
respect what was just said by building on it .
uh , building on that ...
... we should order dinner .
how is that building on what he just said ?
building on what sheldon said , i could go for chinese .
hang on . building on what leonard said ,
no one built on what i said .
building on &quot; building on that , &quot;
there &apos;s a new build @-@ your @-@ own pizza place on colorado .
building on that , i &apos;d like to remind you ,
i &apos;m lactose intolerant .
i saw the menu . they have soy cheese .
you didn &apos;t say &quot; building on . &quot; you &apos;re out !
it &apos;s not simon says .
yeah , you &apos;re missing the point , sheldon .
you &apos;re out , and you &apos;re out .
i win ! who wants pizza ?
penny ?
i haven &apos;t seen you auditioning in a while .
yeah , uh , i got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep .
you quit acting ?
well , kind of .
but now i get to act like
inflamed heart is only a &quot; mild side effect . &quot;
i heard you can make good money doing that .
yeah , it &apos;s going okay , but i do miss this sometimes .
really ?
&apos;cause i got to tell you , i am so sick of the humiliation
and being treated like a piece of meat .
chelsea ?
wish me luck .
they &apos;re gonna love you .
i heard she &apos;s pushing 40 and everything &apos;s fake .
yeah . i started that rumor .
okay , since we agree on the delivery system for the message ,
maybe we should talk about what the message could be .
well , i think we should show what earthlings look like .
the plaque they sent up on the pioneer probe
had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it .
yeah , i never cared for that .
it &apos;s advertising to predator races
just how soft and squishy we are .
squeeze yourself !
oh , don &apos;t be offended .
you know , of the four of us ,
you have the most veal @-@ like consistency .
well , maybe there &apos;s a way to appear nonaggressive ,
but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary .
like smiling and waving with one hand ,
but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger .
you want to send a passive @-@ aggressive message
out into the universe ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
oh , you mean passive @-@ aggressive
like posting pictures of you and your wife
eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth ?
perhaps howard meant passive @-@ aggressive
like asking our group to help on your project ,
and then only choosing leonard .
look , i &apos;m sorry i hurt your feelings ,
but you do have strong personalities
and always end up taking over .
it &apos;s not always .
what about when we went to comic @-@ con
and dressed like jabba the hutt ?
基本就是一条大型脑满肠肥样鼻涕虫
you got to be jabba &apos;s head ,
and i got to be his fat slug butt .
we looked great .
you let a guy sit on me .
he was dressed as princess leia .
it made a nice picture .
i &apos;m just saying , sometimes raj and i feel pushed aside .
yeah . like when you took sheldon to texas
and showed him all around nasa--
you didn &apos;t even think to ask me and leonard .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i should have asked you .
yeah , and if he does ask you , go .
it &apos;s amazing .
okay , and if we &apos;re talking about being left out of things ,
you guys went to skywalker ranch without us .
oh , i recommend that , too .
that was a magical experience !
wait a minute .
sheldon spent a whole day with james earl jones
and never told any of us .
i sure did .
oh , my goodness !
well , from jabba &apos;s head to ice cream with darth vader ,
i &apos;m having a heck of a ride .
yeah , look ,
clearly , good things happen when i &apos;m in charge .
now , why don &apos;t you boys step aside ,
let me knock this project out ?
sheldon , you &apos;re not in charge .
raj is in charge .
leonard , who &apos;s really in charge ?
the person in charge , or those who put him in charge ?
he &apos;s right .
if you think about it , we &apos;re all in charge .
no , the guy in charge is in ...
why is everyone so bad at these ? !
i mean , the whole experience reminded me
about how much i hated about that world .
you @-@ you know , the anxiety , the depression , the negativity .
i don &apos;t want to feel those things .
i want to sell drugs to people who feel those things .
i can &apos;t believe you got up and walked out
of an audition for a big movie .
i did .
i @-@ i mean , i walked in , read for the part ,
then stunk up the place , but then i walked right out .
well , i &apos;m glad you have a new appreciation for your job .
i do , and you know , i don &apos;t think
i &apos;ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it .
properly , at all .
it &apos;s just words i &apos;ve never heard .
well , thank you .
you &apos;re a good friend , and you changed my life .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , now that you &apos;re making some real money ,
maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank @-@ you dinner .
sure .
and you probably have to invite your other friend
&apos;cause she overheard you talking about it ,
and it would be awkward to exclude her .
okay .
how about now ?
all right .
don &apos;t forget your wallet .
i ...
greetings from planet earth .
just turn left at alpha centauri .
you can &apos;t miss it .
即 &quot; 生生不息 繁荣昌盛 &quot;
