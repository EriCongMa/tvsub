hi , you guys .
what &apos;s the matter ?
well , it &apos;s just .. it &apos;s one of these situations that i just hate .
a massage client gave me three tickets ... to the helmut peltz exhibit at the morgan chase museum .
now you &apos;re thinking you gotta sleep with him .
no . no . it &apos;s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us .
i &apos;ll give up my ticket .
me too .
okay . that &apos;s so generous.and i think ross is generous too .
great ! then it &apos;s just us girls.great.yeah.
so what is the exhibit ?
it &apos;s mostly just photographs ... of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches .
oh , man !
hey , ross , listen.chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend .
thanks , but i have plans . elizabeth and i are going out of town .
that &apos;s great ! -yeah.think about all the money that you &apos;re gonna make .
why ? what ?
well , her father pays you for babysitting , right ?
that &apos;s funny . but maybe it &apos;s time to move on.you know , let it go . stop it !
besides , rachel &apos;s going out with elizabeth &apos;s father ... so he &apos;s much older than she is .
looks like i &apos;m not the only one interested in fossils .
all that does is remind us that you &apos;re interested in fossils .
okay , okay.rachel &apos;s gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear .
ross ?
come on ! that &apos;s funny .
because he &apos;s gonna .. he &apos;s got , like , a hearing aid .
because he &apos;s all old .
one second .
okay , look , ross .
just so you know , since lizzie likes you so much ... i &apos;ve accepted the fact that you &apos;re dating her .
really ? that &apos;s great .
yeah , but then i changed my mind.i &apos;m funny like that .
so i told lizzie , now i &apos;m telling you.i don &apos;t want you seeing my daughter anymore .
look , i realize it upsets you.yes , it does .
but elizabeth and i are both adults ...
so i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything you can do about it .
i &apos;ll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired .
oh , a man with a plan !
the one where paul &apos;s the man
this is so exciting . you can get your picture back up on the wall of fame .
he &apos;s got all the big actors .
it was so cool when i was up there .
me and jim belushi would just be cracking up about something .
i get fired off days of our lives and he takes me down .
now he &apos;s just laughing at me .
look at him . that smug belushi bastard !
okay . maybe when they put your picture back up they could put you by matt lauer .
look at him just smiling at me .
yeah , i know . we &apos;d be great together .
so i &apos;m back .
who are you ?
joey tribbiani.from the wall ?
okay , maybe this will jog your memory .
okay , anyway.i &apos;m ready to go back up on the wall . i &apos;m the star of a new tv show .
show me in the tv book .
it &apos;s not on tv yet.well , then it &apos;s not on the wall yet .
okay , fine . i will bring you a tape .
so , now , do you have any of matt lauer &apos;s clothes ? maybe ? just ones that haven &apos;t been cleaned yet ?
i love museums.soaking up all the culture .
yeah .
where do you want to start ?
the gift shop !
and then lunch .
yes , but i can &apos;t eat too much.paul &apos;s taking me out to dinner tonight .
he said he has a big surprise planned .
do you think maybe he &apos;s gonna tell you he &apos;s gay ?
what ? no , why ?
no reason . that would just be a really big surprise , right ?
you could put the aisle over here and have the wedding ceremony over here .
i didn &apos;t know you could get married here.this would be a beautiful place to get married .
but i wouldn &apos;t put the aisle there . and i would never have the ceremony there .
you &apos;d have the ceremony under a beautiful arch .
may i help you ?
sorry . didn &apos;t mean to interrupt . it &apos;s just such a beautiful space.do you do a lot of weddings ?
yes , we &apos;re popular.there &apos;s a two @-@ year waiting list . sorry .
monica , you should put your name down for this place .
what ? are you crazy ? i &apos;m not getting married . i &apos;m not even engaged .
but there &apos;s a two @-@ year wait .
what if you get engaged in two years ? then you &apos;ve got to wait another two years ? that &apos;s four years .
chandler &apos;s not gonna wait that long.he &apos;s gonna find somebody else .
someone who did put their name on the list .
it can &apos;t hurt to put your name down .
if , in two years , you &apos;re not engaged , you just don &apos;t use it .
i guess there is no harm in putting my name down .
i &apos;m gonna do it too.me too !
really ? who would you marry ?
i don &apos;t have anyone right now .
oh , phoebe .
don &apos;t feel too sorry for me . at least my boyfriend isn &apos;t gay .
phoebe , that &apos;s not .. don &apos;t even get me started on yours .
did you watch the tape of my show ?
i did .
let &apos;s get me back up there .
you don &apos;t go up on the wall .
what ? but you saw the show .
lt was very offensive to my people .
dry cleaners ?
russians . it showed them as terrorists and villains .
okay , okay . look , you got harrison ford up there !
that &apos;s right . mr. ford is a very good customer.he brings us a lot of clothes . you bring nothing !
okay , that may be true.but in air force one ,
okay , the russians were terrorists and evil !
and plus , he kills a bunch of them . that &apos;s offensive to russians .
i &apos;ve never seen it .
you should . it &apos;s great !
this place is really beautiful .
i &apos;ve been coming here since i was a kid . this used to be my grandma &apos;s .
the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes .
i mean , not her actual eyeballs .
but people say that my eyes look ...
do you wanna make out ? sure .
are you okay ? what &apos;s wrong ?
yeah . i was just thinking about your father .
well , whatever works for you .
no.he just really freaked me out before .
so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.big deal .
besides , we &apos;ve had fun hiding it.yeah.
yeah ? -you brought protection , right ?
why , are there , like , bears or something ?
protection . yeah . no , yeah . that .. that i forgot .

and i just put our names down for fun.i mean , what &apos;s the harm in that ?
right here .
please don &apos;t think i was trying to pressure you .
phoebe and rachel thought ..
phoebe and rachel ?
so the people that knew about our wedding before me were you ... phoebe and rachel ,
hildy , and some band called the starlight magic seven ...
who are available , by the way .
it was a mistake.please don &apos;t take this to mean anything , because it doesn &apos;t .
okay .
really ?
yes . if it really doesn &apos;t mean anything , because you know i &apos;m not ready .
i know.i know.okay.
all right.i &apos;m gonna go tell joey that you &apos;re back.we were really worried about you .
and that guy that never delivered his burrito ? he thought there was some sort of connection .
did she buy it ? totally .
so did hildy show you the place ?
yeah . it &apos;s beautiful .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gonna ask monica to marry you.i know .
hey , gunther .
