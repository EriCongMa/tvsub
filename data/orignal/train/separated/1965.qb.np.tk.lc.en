i got to open him up now . if i don &apos;t , he &apos;s dead .
again , i &apos;m not gonna allow you to open up a man in my ward .
this is not an o.r. you are not an attending .
no . no , no , no .
are -- are you insane ?
dr. siegel , this man is going to die .
warren , what are you doing ?
i got it . i got his aorta in my hand .
yeah , i got a pulse .
right now , you better be praying
that this man doesn &apos;t die on the table .
this was a judgment call .
i took a risk , it paid off , and this man is alive .
i feel like i &apos;d get in trouble for something like that .
it must be nice being married to the chief .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
really ? warren &apos;s married to the chief ,
so he &apos;s scrubbed in down there on a surgery
while we &apos;re stuck watching up here .
you don &apos;t think the two are related ?
i know they are .
it was a unique situation --
i got an earful on how unique it was .
i &apos;m clear on the situation .
i was trying to save a life .
the man was dying .
and how is he now ?
alive . stable . i got to him in time .
no , you got lucky .
if you &apos;d been left - with a dead man on that table
after you did what you did ...
i wouldn &apos;t be letting you off with just a 3 @-@ day suspension .
you &apos;re suspending me ?
i used to spend hours
studying old footage of my mother &apos;s surgeries .
i dissected every move ,
every cut , every decision .
i was piecing together a puzzle --
watching , studying , learning .
it &apos;s a luxury we don &apos;t have
when a patient is splayed open in front of us .
where &apos;s the main lobby ?
there .
we can &apos;t rewind .
and the garage ?
over there .
there &apos;s no replay .
but he won &apos;t get that far .
i got guys at all the doors , guys rolling back tape .
we &apos;ll find him .
yeah , you don &apos;t know that .
look , it &apos;s my job to overreact , and i &apos;m not there yet .
i &apos;m telling you , this is not a code pink situation .
we just have to cut
and hope to god we know what the hell we &apos;re doing .
you need to call a code pink now .
we &apos;re not there yet , karev .
the kid &apos;s hiding . it happens all the time .
dad &apos;s got anger issues .
custody battle with a huge fight just this morning .
if he took the kid -- - statistically speaking ,
that &apos;s not what happened .
not to mention , my patient &apos;s infection puts him
at risk for an airway obstruction
if we don &apos;t find him right away .
attention , gage dean , please return to your room .
attention , gage dean .
are you kidding me with that ? he &apos;s 6 .
he &apos;s not listening to announcements ,
but i bet you his dad is , which means you just
scared the guy into moving even faster .
i don &apos;t think you understand
how a code pink disrupts this facility .
all automatic doors lock .
elevators stop functioning .
good . it &apos;ll stop the dad .
no , it &apos;ll potentially put patients in danger .
there &apos;s a kid who &apos;s in danger , and the longer we stand here
debating this , he &apos;s getting further away .
code pink is a nuclear option .
just let my guys - look around for a little bit .
what if it was tuck ?
call it . - you sure you want - to pull the trigger on this ?
sounding the alarm ? initiating a lock @-@ down ?
yes , now .
she &apos;s sure .
she &apos;s calling it .
jackson , i had no idea , or i never would have --
i @-@ i was-- i wasn &apos;t trying to --
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m supposed to be , like ,
a hundred feet from you or something .
if i had known that you weren &apos;t trying t--
i thought you were gonna take my baby , and so --
did you set that off for me , too ?
oh , no .
quick , go , go , go , go , go , go , go .
why are we suddenly running a relay race ?
code pink . hospital &apos;s on lock @-@ down .
those doors just bolted shut behind us .
if we &apos;re gonna be stuck somewhere ,
we need to have access to an o.r.
what is that , an alarm ?
code pink -- missing kid .
it &apos;s almost ... relaxing .
they don &apos;t want to freak people out .
it seems like they would want that .
esophageal atresia , pulmonary sequestration ,
spina bifida boy , spina bifida girl ,
and teratoma cutie , so great . everyone &apos;s here .
it says here the code &apos;s for a 6 @-@ year @-@ old kid ,
not an infant .
i don &apos;t care .
if someone &apos;s stealing babies ,
you count all the babies .
brown hair , green shirt .
name -- gage dean .
well , it &apos;s not like we can do anything from in here .
gage ?
gage dean , are you in here ?
there . we did something .
wire cutter .
i just need a description of your husband , ma &apos;am .
ex @-@ husband .
i know the guy . i &apos;m just gonna start looking --
the only way to get through the doors right now
is with one of these badges .
my men will fan out from peds .
they &apos;ll take it room by room .
we &apos;ve got it handled -- dr. karev .
out of my way , cross .
no one came through here with a kid , right ?
6 years old , green shirt ?
uh , i don &apos;t think so , but we &apos;re kind of slammed .
i &apos;ve got these other kids from the accident .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know . i --
bailey should have called this thing earlier .
he &apos;s probably just hiding somewhere .
that &apos;s what kids do , right ?
yeah , right .
we &apos;ve walked the western perimeter .
tell stokes to report in with --
hold it .
what ?
karev found him .
kill the code . start running the reports .
he &apos;s okay .
oh , thank goodness they found him .
all right . how is he ?
well , he &apos;s a little shaken up
but no worse for the wear , right , gage ?
we &apos;re all making overtime today .
all righty .
he was hiding . like i said .
excuse me !
excuse me !

i still can &apos;t get a pulse .
i have to get to the nicu .
i was paged . i --
oh , my god . what -- what is going on ?
what happened ? what did you do ?

i got it . go .
okay , clear a path , people !
coming through . watch out .
dr. warren thought it was a delayed abruption
from the car accident .
is robbins is in the o.r. ? is she ready ?
she needs to be scrubbed when we get there .
i know . i paged her .
she hasn &apos;t stopped bleeding .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s uterine atony or --
keep shoving in more packing , deluca .
i am . it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s coming out faster than it &apos;s going in .
how long &apos;s she been hypotensive ?
uh , at first she was fine , then she just --
how long ?
maybe five or six minutes before you arrived .
i &apos;m not sure .
you need to get sure , deluca .
i &apos;m gonna ask you again .
how long since her pressure bottomed out ?
i &apos;m sorry .
sweetie , never do that again .
i was scared about the pear @-@ eh @-@ toe--
the peritonsillarabscess ?
look , don &apos;t be .
you &apos;ve got this , buddy .
once i get in there and fix your throat ,
you &apos;re gonna feel so much better .
you &apos;re gonna be eating ice cream
and sliding down the rails of those stairs .
and riding the elevator ?
sure , whatever you want .
just no more running away , okay ?
it scares your mom , and i need to know where you are ...
at all times .
i &apos;m sorry . i need to go check on something .
hey , do you know what happened ?
i just heard that gretchen mckay needs a crash @-@ c .
you should tell the nicu that the baby &apos;s coming .
arizona .
if she &apos;s lost blood ,
then the baby &apos;s lost even more .
has she even been cross @-@ matched ?
the crash @-@ c already happened .
what ? !
he &apos;s not oxygenating .
page cardio and neuro .
okay .
how old is this baby ?
how far along was she ?
uh , 32 w-- no , 34 weeks , i think .
you think ? was she pre @-@ eclamptic ?
diabetic ?
was there evidence of an abruption or a previo--
no , no , i mean , yeah .
it was a delayed abruption , or seemed to be .
she was hypotensive --
history of rh incompatibility ? talk to me , warren .

okay . -
is my baby gonna die ?
crap . he &apos;s bradying down .
the mom abrupted .
she needed an emergent c @-@ section .
in the middle of the hallway ? what the hell happened ?
you have to understand , i @-@ i would have lost them both .
well , now we might anyway .
send for an abg now .
okay , what else can i do ?
nothing . just -- just stand there .
no , i @-@ i want to help .
dr. warren , i need to speak with you , privately .
w @-@ when the baby &apos;s stable , i &apos;ll find you .
i @-@ i need to stay . i need to assist .
w @-@ we need to increase the frequency to 600 bpms
and set the i.t. to 33 % --
dr. warren , i &apos;m not asking . come with me ...
right now .
look , she was hypotensive .
she was bottoming out .
she -- - stop talking .
do not tell me a single thing .
nothing .
i am the chief of surgery .
every single thing you tell me i have to use .
so do not speak , got it ?
yeah .
just stay right here in this office .
don &apos;t come out . don &apos;t talk to anyone .
just wait for me to come back .
one thing .
benjamin !
how is gretchen ?
not one word .
edwards , i could use some traction here .
nice work , grey .
balloon catheter -- good idea .
we almost did a thoracotomy in the e.r.
yeah , this bought us some time .
no , i mean ,
we almost got to do thoracotomy in the e.r. ,
which , you know , would have been amazing .
they must have found the kid , right ?
you think he was hiding somewhere ?
&apos;cause , i mean , how many times do you get to operate
outside the operating room ?
okay , for the record ,
it sounds fun until you do it .
grey .
gretchen mckay .
how &apos;s she doing ?
uh , well , she just had an emergency c @-@ section
performed by a resident .
what ? she was fine when i left her .
okay , well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking .
your name is listed as the attending ,
so why did you leave her ?
uh , well , i just did the initial trauma eval ,
and then i got pulled into her husband &apos;s room .
it was robbins &apos; case .
but i handed her off to you ,
and you left her with robbins ?
no , i left her with warren .
did warren do the c @-@ section , or --
just tell me what happened .
gretchen mckay , 34 weeks pregnant .
no sign of abdominal trauma .
she does need an o.b. consult . where &apos;s robbins ?
on her way . how can i --
you can help deluca get her off this board .
omar wasn &apos;t wearing his seat belt .
spencer dropped a book . omar reached back to get it .
okay , he &apos;s right next door being checked out .
the car in front just stopped .
i hit the brakes .
her bp &apos;s dropping .
okay , warren , what do we do ?
deluca , move .
third trimester can &apos;t always tolerate supine position .
puts pressure on her ivc ,
so we roll her to her left and ...
okay .
there you go . bp &apos;s back up .
good job .
all right . gretchen , are you comfortable ?
my kids , uh ... how are my kids ?
i &apos;ll have someone find out , okay ?
they &apos;re , uh -- they &apos;re fine . they &apos;re fine .
jasmine has a bit of a stiff neck ,
and trevor &apos;s just a little nervous ,
but spencer has two loose front teeth
that he can &apos;t stop wiggling , but ...
those were loose before --
before today , yeah , that &apos;s what he said .
don &apos;t worry . we got them .
thank you .
grey ! we need an extra set of hands over here !
okay , i &apos;ll be right there !
that &apos;s my husband . that &apos;s my husband next door .
okay , so i will go check on him for you .
robbins will be by to scan her
and admit her for observation .
are you okay here ?
yes . go .
okay .
did you ask him ?
did you ask him if he was good , or did he tell you he was good ?
bailey , he was fine .
but you didn &apos;t even wait for robbins .
how do you even know she got there ?
dr. bailey , i saw robbins .
what do we got ?
okay . abdomen is tense and distended .
his belly &apos;s full of blood .
pressure &apos;s 60 over 40 .
edwards , let &apos;s prep for a thoracotomy .
oh , my g-- uh , o @-@ okay . okay .
edwards , what if we did a balloon catheter ?
robbins was in there . i saw her .
you saw her ?
i did .
i mean , so how is she ? is the baby okay ?
bailey ?
i heard there was blood on the walls ...
and the ceiling .
well , you know how amputations bleed .
you hit the femoral at just the right angle ,
and it &apos;s amputations ?
i heard he cut into some lady in a hallway .
no , i heard he cut the leg off of some lady in an elevator .
below @-@ knee . very clean cut .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
what the hell are you two doing ?
this isn &apos;t a movie .
dr. warren is not here for your entertainment .
what is this ?
concessions ?
i , um -- i apologize . - sorry , dr. torres .
why are you still here ?
you heard her . scram .
what &apos;s that ?
oh . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s nothing .
i was holding on to it for gretchen .
her kid lost a tooth .
okay . i need to know everything .
yes , chief .
i need to know what you two were doing .
i need to know exactly how and exactly why this happened .
yes , chief .
look , her scans all look clear .
i know . we thought so , too .
we &apos;re done ? already ?
yep . you did great .
scans look clear , gretchen .
good , then can we get my kids ?
i &apos;m sure the boys are destroying the emergency room by now .
one , two ... three .
yeah , well , uh , let &apos;s get you up in o.b. ,
and then we &apos;ll bring them up to you , all right ?
let &apos;s roll her .
you cold ?
maybe a little .
okay , i &apos;ll get you another blanket , all right ?
can you find out about my husband ?
yeah , absolutely .
you okay ? you comfortable ?
this is -- my stomach hurts one way , my back hurts another .
you know , let &apos;s , uh -- let-- let &apos;s stop for a sec .
i &apos;m gonna prop you up a little more , all right ?
deluca , grab a pillow .
yeah .
there you go .
is that better ?
yeah , it &apos;s ...
no . my stomach hurts .
oh , it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t feel so good .
her pulse was a little high . she was clammy and shivering .
so dr. warren made a call .
you know what ? we &apos;re gonna get you up to o.b.
and call dr. robbins , okay ?
okay
this way .
she &apos;s hypotensive .
gr @-@ gretchen , you &apos;re doing great .
you &apos;re doing great . we have to get her up to --
all right . i got her .
hang in there . almost there .
i &apos;ve lost the heartbeat .
what ?
deluca !
well , it , uh -- it might just be that the transducer slipped .
oh , it hurts !
yeah , i know . i know . we are so close .
go . get robbins or anybody from o.b.
i &apos;ll take her up .
by yourself ?
go !
okay .
okay , gretchen , as soon as the elevator gets here ,
we &apos;re gonna take you up and take care of you , all right ?
oh , no .
go ! go faster ! right now ! go !
what the hell ?
th @-@ they &apos;re locked .
go , go , go , go , go !
they &apos;re all locked !
we were trapped in there .
okay , we waited for someone to come , but ...
and she was ...
she was crashing .
we were gonna lose them both .
all right ? there wasn &apos;t a choice .
and you &apos;re certain of that ?
yeah .
that &apos;s what dr. warren said .
they put the mckay baby on an oscillator .
it was hard to watch .
so little , doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
warren didn &apos;t come out yet ?
no . no one &apos;s gone in , either .
at least , not since we &apos;ve been here .
i just don &apos;t know why he did it .
why didn &apos;t he wait ?
well , i guess he thought he didn &apos;t have a choice .
they didn &apos;t know how long they &apos;d be stuck there .
damn it .
nicu .
thanks for the chip .
still , though . in a hallway ?
look , i get it .
we almost opened up the husband in trauma ,
and it was all i wanted to do .
surgery is a drug .
and operating outside the o.r. ?
that is mainlining .
but he &apos;s a level head .
he &apos;s gramps .
we are talking about the same person who used a clipboard
to slice open a patient in the psych ward .
gramps goes rogue .
what do you think will happen to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
if it was us ?
yeah . he &apos;s married to the chief .
maybe he &apos;s invincible .
yeah .
sir .
oh .
what ?
doctors .
diffuse loss of muscle tone .
i can &apos;t get him to oxygenate .
he needs to go on ecmo .
you think this little guy can handle that ?
no .
neither do i , but it &apos;s the only chance he has .
sats are in the 80s .
i &apos;m with you . do it .
we need parental consent . where are the parents ?
mom &apos;s in o.r. 1 , dad &apos;s in o.r. 2 .
just go ahead and do it .
the uterine arteries are clamped ,
but there &apos;s still blood everywhere .
she &apos;s not clotting . she &apos;s in d.i.c.
order eight more units of blood and ffp .
well , how &apos;s she doing ?
oh , good . bailey , where &apos;s warren ?
i want to talk to him . what the hell happened ?
well , that &apos;s what i want to know .
grey handed this patient off to you in the e.r.
yeah . suction .
and then deluca said they got stuck ,
and then they had to --
well , where were you when all this happened ?
hang another two units of blood on the level 1 .
the suction &apos;s not working . fix it .
robbins .
um , i had -- i had warren take her to ct .
well , why didn &apos;t you take her ?
w @-@ what were you doing ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t even know , bailey . she was stable .
a resident can take a stable patient to ct .
well , not when her fetus is in distress .
you think a resident should --
bailey , they were both stable
when i left them with warren !
gretchen , good news .
your baby is great . the heartbeat is strong .
there &apos;s no signs of any problems .
hang in there , cosmo .
cosmo ?
yeah , that won &apos;t be his real name ,
but it &apos;s what we &apos;re calling him till he gets here .
omar had this really boring partner dinner
that i agreed to go to because --
hello -- night out like a grown @-@ up ,
and three cosmopolitans later ...
baby on board .
yikes .
gretchen , your husband &apos;s on his way up to surgery right now ,
but , uh , i have a visitor for you .
come here , peanut .
are you okay ?
yeah .
are you ?
spencer &apos;s tooth came out -- one of them .
he wants you to see it .
did he pull it out , or did you ?
i helped .
all right , we &apos;ll get you to ct first and then up to o.b.
uh , the kids can meet you there .
oh , deluca , do you mind finding something to put that in ?
yeah .
thanks .
okay , just a few more minutes .
hang in there .
and , jasmine , you &apos;re in charge .
okay , just keep your hands out of your brother &apos;s mouth .
okay .
so take her up to ct and then let me know
when the scans are up .
okay .
she was fine when i left her .
oh @-@ chromic .
besides , it &apos;s warren .
clamp .
what do you mean , &quot; it &apos;s warren ? &quot;
i mean if there was any resident i &apos;d want
to do an emergency c @-@ section , it would be warren .
he &apos;s good .
he has done them before .
if he said he had to , i believe him .
he had to . he saved her life .
all right , be quiet !
basin .
suction .
here .
robbins .
okay , deluca , start cpr .
you can stop now .
stop , deluca .
come on .
come on .
i said stop .
time of death -- 17 : 02 .
the dad made it .
the mom didn &apos;t .
i hate it when it &apos;s babies .
me too .
um , dr. webber , i wanted to talk to you about benjamin warren .
yeah , i thought you might .
yeah , well , as head of the residency program ,
i thought disciplinary action would be more appropriate
coming from you .
thank you .
i see .
yeah , i mean , nothing too harsh , of course ,
but , uh , substantial enough .
whatever you think .
whatever i think .
yes , sir .
no .
excuse me ?
i can &apos;t do that .
i can &apos;t take this out of your hands .
oh , sir -- - a surgical resident could be responsible
for the death of two patients today .
i &apos;m not your chief anymore . this is above my jurisdiction .
oh , come on . - especially - if we &apos;re dealing with
a resident who &apos;s out of control .
don &apos;t -- ben isn &apos;t a danger .
how do you know that ?
are you sure ?
was this a mistake , or was it hubris ?
did he do his job , or did he overstep ?
bailey , i know it &apos;s hard being his wife and his boss ,
but you &apos;re the chief now .
this is your call .
it &apos;s your job .
do your job .
外科主任
hey , just wanted to , uh , see how you &apos;re holding up .

look , i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to do it .
i was out of options . she was crashing .

and even if they come , there &apos;s no more time .
the doors were locked . the elevator was closed .
there was nothing else to do .
you didn &apos;t know when they were gonna open .

hindsight is always 20 / 20 .

when you replay it .
i found something .
you see your mistakes , you know how you &apos;d correct them .
so the doors were locked . the elevator wouldn &apos;t open .
gretchen was unconscious ,
and deluca found a crash cart , right ?
but that &apos;s the kicker , isn &apos;t it ?
you were trapped .
we were trapped .
you got ready to open her up .
you lifted the scalpel .
you had a choice .

i didn &apos;t know - that the doors had opened . i --
