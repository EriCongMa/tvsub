and andre is going as han solo .
the boys are stormtroopers and little baby ben is an ewok .
aw , you don &apos;t have enough children .
happy halloween parties , everyone .
you all look great ... ham .
( calvin and hobbes )
pig . let me guess .
you &apos;re a flimsy excuse to be shirtless , wearing silk underwear .
and you are as wrong as you are welcome .
now , this year , i planned a two @-@ person costume with annie .
she &apos;s going as my ring girl .
pretty freaky @-@ aky , huh ?
annie , no .
i meant the boxing match ring girl .
they &apos;re the sexy ones that hold the round numbers .
yeah , see ? this is why we can &apos;t just text about it , jeff .
i don &apos;t watch sports .
but there &apos;s no boxer in the ring .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t watch scary movies .
and that &apos;s why we leave the couples &apos; costumes to the couples ,
she said wisely .
you should probably warn your boyfriend &apos;s boyfriend .
just because we &apos;re dating doesn &apos;t mean
that we have to do everything together .
well , you need to do some things together .
we do some things .
we do a lot of things .
not all the things .
things .
okay , so ,
we &apos;re all here , minus pierce ,
who wasn &apos;t invited to vicki &apos;s party
for reasons beyond our control or concern .
no mystery there . she put a pencil through his face .
does vicki have a tv ?
abed , it &apos;s a party .
you &apos;re not watching tv .
no , i &apos;ll be watching annie .
she started watching cougar town re @-@ runs ,
which makes annie my third favorite show ,
and tonight is their hallo @-@ wine special .
ooh , that &apos;s right . better not miss the merlot .
clink ! what ? you fall into it .
that was pierce . he accidentally
locked himself in his panic room and he needs our help .
no , &quot; oh ! &quot;
&quot; oh &quot; means we are going against our will ,
and we are not going . he &apos;s lying .
he seemed pretty upset ,
and he &apos;s been all alone up there in that mansion
ever since i moved out ,
and his dad , you know , got killed by jeff .
calling for help . a classic call for help .
hello , dr. perry &apos;s office . damaged psyche ?
yes , i &apos;ll accept the charges .
heads , lock up your brains .
britta &apos;s on the prowl for fresh therapy meat .
maybe we should just stop by on our way to the party .
i assure you ,
the only thing pierce is trapped in is adolescence .
he is a geriatric toddler ,
throwing the most elaborate tantrums money can buy ,
and i , for one , am not gonna stand by and allow
some lonely , ridiculous person
to derail our group &apos;s plans .
to your corners , fighters .
someone save me a towel .
you guys going to vicki &apos;s party ?
we just gotta do this thing first .
第四季第二集
holy helen , this place is huge .
it seems spookier than i remember .
ah , the only thing spooky about this place is the tacky decor .
it &apos;s like david lee roth threw up miami vice .
后者为同年代摇滚歌手
so tacky .
i don &apos;t know . maybe pierce isn &apos;t doing so well
since he lost his father and then his
inheritance in a video game battle with gilbert ,
an illegitimate half @-@ brother he never knew he had .
an illegitimate half @-@ brother he never knew he had .
i guess i &apos;ve never said it out loud .
guys , over here .
mr. hawthorne &apos;s panic room ,
one of the 27 stops on the guided tour
i had to memorize before moving into hawthorne manor .
does the house get many visitors ?
you &apos;re the first .
impenetrable titanium carbonite door ,
hacker @-@ proof key @-@ code access panel ,
and impressive video telecom screen with remote .
maximum occupancy one , with female companion .
purchased june 30 , 1989 .
it took me forever to remember that date .
june 30 , 1989 .
theatrical release of do the right thing .
wait ! it might be a trap .
or it might let him out .
either way , we ...
oh , put a sock in it , shorts .
oh , hey , guys .
pierce , are you okay ?
oh , sure . fine , fine .
i was dusting in here ,
and i must have bumped a switch or something .
as the graceful one in the group ,
i &apos;m kind of embarrassed .
don &apos;t be . i &apos;ve been locked in way worse places than this .
oh , not against my will .
been in there long ?
no , not long , but i couldn &apos;t remember the damn code .
sorry to be a burden on you guys ,
but i guess that &apos;s all i am now .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re happy to help .
yeah , no sweat , boba fett .
yeah . do you have a tv ?
what abed means is , did you write the code down anywhere ?
yes . it &apos;s in a red notebook in my study
or my bedroom , maybe .
i used to know where everything was before i fired my maid .
now there &apos;s no reason to use my safe .
that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll find it . it &apos;ll take two secs .
or we take one sec and just skip to the catch .
this place has not been dusted in months ,
and he starts with the panic room ?
no sale . he &apos;s not a sad old man .
he &apos;s a sad old liar .
jeffrey !
no , no , he &apos;s right . i &apos;ve been lying to you .
the truth is , last night , i got up to get a glass of
red w ... uh , water ,
and on my way back from the cellar ,
i saw something that scared me so badly ,
i locked myself in here , on purpose .
the part about not remembering the code is true .
i &apos;m very thirsty .
why didn &apos;t you call me sooner ?
i had to come up with that awesome dusting story
because if you knew what spooked me ,
you &apos;d probably call me crazy and old .
no one &apos;s gonna call you , pierce .
you can tell us . we &apos;re here to help you .
i thought i saw my dad .
it looked like his face was coming right through the wall ,
but that &apos;s impossible , because my dad is dead .
i mean , not , aha , your dad is dead ,
but , aha , i knew it .
ghost dad , exploring your haunted mansion for secret codes ?
nice try , pierce . you gotta be kidding me !
what in the scooby @-@ doo is happening to you people ?
jeff , just go to the party , and we &apos;ll meet you there .
we &apos;re gonna stay here and help pierce .
he doesn &apos;t need help . he needs attention .
are you really this naive ?
am i naive ?
i &apos;m sure as stuff not your sexy little ring girl .
i ...
can it , ham .
she &apos;s also my ride .
the truth is ...
pierce &apos;s bedroom is the third door on the left .
i didn &apos;t leave my short @-@ term memory at coachella .
jeez , winger , keep it above the belt .
i &apos;m sorry .
ah , already forgotten .
this house is getting to me .
i know . kind of weird that a dead person used to live here .
no , what &apos;s weird is that a living person lived here
with his parents , well into his 60s .
then they died , and he &apos;s still here ,
like a paralyzed peter pan .
not for long .
i &apos;m gonna set my shrink @-@ ray to daddy issues
and blast that sucker full of closure .
well , i guess it can &apos;t hurt .
exactly , because , in one way or another ,
therapy is always helpful .
no , because there &apos;s no possible way
you could mess him up worse .
it &apos;s like practicing on a cadaver .
knock yourself out .
this has got to be it .
i wish i didn &apos;t have so much exposed skin .
tubular .
i , too , lack the adjectives .
now , how does one search for a
red notebook that doesn &apos;t exist without looking ,
touching , or creating future nightmares ?
i &apos;ll check the nightstand .
i &apos;ll check my messages .
oh , my god .
pierce keeps his dad &apos;s bowtie by his bed .
yeesh .
table for siggy freud , party of ...
britta , stop answering phones .
how about we ask rip van racism where the codes are ?
其外形酷似皮尔斯老爹
don &apos;t . that &apos;s not nice .
what ?
he was a tight @-@ fisted , philandering bigot
who got to outlive most bridges .
we don &apos;t owe him our reverence .
so , how about it , you old bag of dust ?
you got our numbers ?
i &apos;m serious . stop it .
come on .
you don &apos;t really believe in ghosts ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m just not so quick to rule it out .
i believe people can be haunted
by unresolved issues in their past .
yeah , but issues don &apos;t turn into ghosts .
maybe for pierce , they have .
maybe pierce and his dad have some seriously unfinished business .
no , the dead can &apos;t have business .
they can &apos;t want or think or do .
it &apos;s what makes them dead .
it &apos;s the living who choose to be haunted .
cornelius was barely a dad .
now , he &apos;s nothing .
and pierce keeps staring into that void
or he can turn around , face his future like i did ,
and say , &quot; who gives a crap who my dad was ?
i &apos;m my own man now . i ... &quot;
wow . pretty slick , britta ,
using ghosts to trick me into opening up .
too bad it didn &apos;t work .
aw , man , so this is what the zone feels like .
oh ! analyze this !
we don &apos;t want to go over the same area twice ,
so be thorough .
thorough . got it .
more of a burnt umber , but i won &apos;t hold that against him .
&quot; pierce hawthorne &apos;s ideas for ladies &quot; ?
oh , please .
&quot; blonde , long legs , with tennis racquet .
&quot; asian rockette .
big boobs , redhead , but doctor , &quot; question mark .
oh , he &apos;s not 100 % on that one ?
this is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me .
okay , i don &apos;t have the codes .
maybe shirley and troy are having better luck in the library .
abed ?
abed ?
if this is supposed to be , like ,
that part in that movie that &apos;s like this ,
i would like to remind you that i don &apos;t watch scary movies
and therefore cannot appreciate the homage .
abed ?
i hate reference humor .
hold on .
i &apos;ve been offended by this coat rack before .
are we going in circles ?
okay , so maybe i spent a little less time in the library
than , say , the walk @-@ in cereal closet ,
but it &apos;s definitely near here .
you skipped this door .
pierce told me i don &apos;t need to go in there .
then it &apos;s probably the library .
racist son of a ...
sodom and gomorrah .
it &apos;s pierce &apos;s special gym . he never let me use it ,
&apos;cause he thinks i &apos;m a child .
hold ...
he &apos;s hiding the indoor swing , and i &apos;m the child .
no . troy , get out of there .
why does he have so many collars ?
secret dogs !
it &apos;s okay . come on . oh , no .
forget you saw that ,
and then forget i knew what it was .
great , you won &apos;t tell me , pierce won &apos;t tell me .
i have no idea what to google . i &apos;ll never know .
believe me , dating britta ,
you &apos;ll know too much too soon soon enough .
what does britta have to do with this ?
well , she &apos;s a modern woman with experienced tastes .
i think it &apos;s nice you two are dating .
i only hope she doesn &apos;t make you feel pressured .
pressured to what ?
to fulfill her expectations .
expectations of what ?
never mind .
unsatisfied with what ?
i lost abed .
i turned around and he disappeared .
i told you to never let him out of your sight .
that goes double for holidays and wax museums .
how are we gonna find him ?
i don &apos;t know , but we have to .
he &apos;s probably already looking for us .
oh , well , that &apos;s hallo @-@ wine in cougar town for ya .
oh , ladies , i &apos;ll follow you anywhere .
i do not have daddy issues .
you get two minutes .
denial is the first step to acceptance .
that can &apos;t be right .
says the deny @-@ ist .
not a word .
you want to keep digging this hole ?
confronting your daddy issues now
could prevent you from ending up haunted , like pierce .
i &apos;ll never end up like pierce .
won &apos;t you ?
no , because i &apos;m nothing like him .
aren &apos;t you ?
are you gonna keep doing that ?
am i ?
the worst therapist ? no .
because you &apos;re not a therapist .
but since your misdiagnosing by a mile ,
let me point out some differences .
pierce was raised by his dad .
mine took off when i was eight .
pierce spent his whole , pathetic life
begging for scraps of his father &apos;s approval .
i moved on .
maybe pierce needs a dad . i don &apos;t .
don &apos;t you ?
stop that !
okay , if i need a dad so bad ,
how come i &apos;ve had his phone number for three weeks
without the slightest urge to call him ?
you found your dad ?
did i ?
give it here !
i remember when this show was about a community college .
no , you take the fish sticks , senator .
enjoy the boat show .
cool .
cool , cool , cool .
just let me see the number , for medical purposes !
no !
help me heal your heart hole !
never !
so , this is where pierce has been hiding the taste .
here &apos;s to you , cornelius .
gone , but not forgiven .
of course .
otherwise , it wouldn &apos;t be pointless .
this is pointless .
we have no abed , no codes .
pierce sent us on a wild goose chase .
jeff was right . i am naive .
oh , don &apos;t listen to him .
there &apos;s nothing naive about helping a friend in need .
jeff would know that if he wasn &apos;t
too cool for after @-@ school specials .
thanks , troy .
don &apos;t worry . abed &apos;s here .
i can feel him .
maybe we should loop back to the indoor swing room .
indoor swing ? that &apos;s ridiculous .
someone &apos;s gonna break a lamp .
break something on it .
britta , while i applaud your gentle
approach to psychoanalysis ,
i &apos;m not gonna talk about it .
hey , cut it out !
you &apos;re gonna break the ... door .
well , look who came crawling back .
i &apos;m not crawling . walking .
quite briskly . follow !
i like talking to you , annie .
it &apos;s easy . i hope you feel like you can talk to me too .
uh , i ...
spit it out . no secrets between roomies .
behind you !
i &apos;m behind you too .
hands ! wall !
not sure where you &apos;re going here ,
but just let it out .
don &apos;t let it out ! don &apos;t let it out !
all right , pierce , turn off your haunted house !
oh , my god , pierce is dead .
cornelius killed him .
i broke the remote !
do you think it &apos;s expensive ?
please , pierce !
please don &apos;t die slightly before your time .
this means we &apos;re next , and i care about us .
where ...
gotcha !
what the hell ?
i totally had you guys convinced i was dead .
that &apos;ll teach you to value my presence .
pierce .
don &apos;t pierce me .
you were going to vicki &apos;s party without me .
bet you didn &apos;t expect me to fake a haunted house
to teach you a lesson .
that &apos;s exactly what we expected .
for heaven &apos;s sake , pierce ,
vicki &apos;s the one that didn &apos;t invite you .
why didn &apos;t you scare her ?
&apos;cause i hate her .
abed , where have you been ?
i found pierce &apos;s secret surveillance room .
did you guys know he was faking a haunted house ?
this has been abed nadir with the late report .
sorry . good montages take time .
man , it was so easy .
a few shadows , a couple of mirror tricks .
a little , custom @-@ built latex walls ,
and you &apos;re all crappin &apos; in your short pants .
it was pretty impressive ,
particularly the shadowy figure you hired to watch you sleep .
wow , that is creepy .
a stand @-@ out performance . is he sad ?
what are you doing ?
i didn &apos;t hire anyone .
oh , enough , pierce . just open the damn door .
there &apos;s no ghost .
then how do you explain this ?
you probably asked someone to help you with
your stupid prank and then forgot .
uh @-@ uh . levar burton was a hard no .
there &apos;s only one explanation .
i belittled my father &apos;s good name for a prank ,
and his ghost has returned to scold me
and probably butcher you guys for going along with it .
you think hiding in this room is gonna keep you safe ?
ghosts can &apos;t go through doors , stupid .
they &apos;re not fire .
pierce , i am paying a teenager by the hour
to care about my children so i can go to this party ,
so you have to ask yourself ,
is the real threat out there or in here ?
fine . i &apos;ll open it myself .
no , no . he &apos;ll scold me !
someone &apos;s punching in the code from the outside .
please tell me one of us is outside .
may i be some assistance ?
gilbert !
gilbert , what are you doing in my house ?
well , technically , it &apos;s my house .
after our father died ,
i became the sole inheritor of his estate ,
including all six houses and the decommissioned submarine .
what ?
so you came here to kick me out ?
actually , i came here to give you the deed ,
but on the day of my arrival , you were out .
i noticed mail piled up by the door .
i took it in , paid the overdue bills ,
replaced a few light bulbs , and , well ,
that was six weeks ago .
so you &apos;ve been living here in secret this whole time ?
yes . i &apos;m ashamed to say that
after a lifetime as cornelius &apos;s assistant ,
i &apos;ve had a difficult time adjusting to his passing .
it seems his absence has taken a greater toll
than his presence ever did .
taking care of pierce gave my life purpose again ,
but now that i &apos;ve been discovered by your thin friend ,
i must apologize and bid you adieu .
good @-@ bye , pierce .
there &apos;s a load of clean socks in the dryer .
gilbert , wait . wait .
look , i &apos;ve been doing really well since dad died ,
so i don &apos;t need anyone taking care of me ,
but if you &apos;re having a tough time ...
well , i guess i could use a roommate .
will there be anything else , brother ?
yes . bring it in .
have fun at the party .
tell vicki i say happy halloween .
that &apos;ll mess with her .
you sure you don &apos;t want to come ?
i &apos;ve got a mask for you to wear .
one that doesn &apos;t zip at the mouth .
no , thanks .
i &apos;ll hang around here with gilbert .
he needs me .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
what was all that about masks ?
don &apos;t know , don &apos;t want to .
fair enough .
hey , how about you and i skip out on this party ?
why ? to do what and where ?
oh , i was thinking you could show me some inspector spacetime .
you &apos;re always talking about it .
i &apos;ve never seen a full episode .
are you sure you want to ?
it starts pretty slow .
the first inspector couldn &apos;t even time @-@ travel .
that sounds fine .
after a night of running in circles ,
trying to untie winger knots ,
i &apos;m looking for something slow .
sorry i ruined your night .
actually , pierce ruined my night ,
but you were right to let him .
you still want to go to the party ?
i heard vicki bought dry ice
and gave leonard the wrong address .
uh , i &apos;ll take a pass .
i have some unfinished business at home .
troy !
are you in here ?
abed , was that you ?
i want to show you something on the other side of the bookcase .
troy ?
find me as soon as you can .
who is in my house ?
gilbert !
hijinks .
indubitably .
