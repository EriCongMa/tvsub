melissa !
ian didn &apos;t commit suicide .
that entire suicide letter is made up of &quot; a &quot; texts .
what ?
i don &apos;t remember a thing
from the night ali died .
you know what i do remember ?
your pink hair . i thought it was cool .
i know the funeral was today .
i just wanted to come check on you .
wait .
i wanted to see how you were doing
after last night &apos;s near miss .
she was online this morning checking
every college with an endowment and a pool .
so , be happy .
at least it gives us time for a second date .
i really needed a hug from you today ,
not later at your apartment
or tomorrow at hollis .
here , right now .
things are a little tense right now
between me and isabel .
does mom know that ?
your mom catches on pretty fast .
就算是在电话亭里我也愿意嫁给你

sorry i &apos;m late .
so , are you going out
with noel , or was that just a one @-@ off ?
he &apos;s a major get .
now he even has some bad @-@ boy cred .
you know , there &apos;s bad , and then there &apos;s bad .
i caught him at the window .
he broke into your house ?
thank you for not calling the police .
i &apos;ve seen enough cops in my house for one year .
guys , look .
i know you wanna kiss me .
oh , my god ! she was still alive !
why would &quot; a &quot; show us that part of the video ?
to keep us distracted for when the next attack is launched .
or to tell us there &apos;s more to what happened that night .
guys , ian tried to kill me in the bell tower
to get back his perverted videos ,
and he went after ali for the same reason .
yeah , but &quot; a &quot; had us convinced that ian killed alison ,
and now it &apos;s , what , two miles
from the kissing rock to ali &apos;s house .
did she turn off the camera and walk home
in the dark , alone ?
yeah , someone could &apos;ve been waiting for her
and surprised her when she got home .
like who ?
like ian .
just because he didn &apos;t kill alison at the kissing rock ,
doesn &apos;t mean that he didn &apos;t do it an hour later .
if ian didn &apos;t kill ali , did &quot; a &quot; ?
so , uh , did you invite ezra to the show ?
no , he &apos;s out of town presenting a paper at a conference .
did you invite caleb ?
why would i do that ?
because you kissed him .
how was it ?
well , i wore the total wrong gloss .
you know the kind that looks wet ,
but it &apos;s really sticky ?
oof , the wads of hair get stuck to your mouth .
it &apos;s all fun and sexy till somebody hacks up a hairball .
hey , could we please keep folding ?
i needed these done yesterday ,
and i &apos;ve already missed a million committee meetings .
can i get it ? it &apos;s just a text .
if it &apos;s from ezra , then yes .
wow . toby has turned our boss into a romantic .
i was always a romantic !
you know , under a thin veneer of pragmatism
and a few shockingly bad choices .
guys , uh , i &apos;m gonna go deal with this .
do you realize that we finally
all have boyfriends / girlfriends at the same time ?
okay , i do not have a boyfriend !
yeah , you do . you just don &apos;t want to admit it .
tell ezra we say hi .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
can i talk to you for a second ?
look , i said some things after the funeral that
i probably should have kept to myself .
i thought that you felt better knowing that ian had commit ...
well , so did i ,
but i don &apos;t want people getting the wrong idea , you know ?
i won &apos;t say a word .
and , plus , the way you handled things
with my brother , i kind of owe you one .
i have to get back .
we &apos;re , uh , folding programs for the fashion show .
my mom gets in tomorrow .
one final speech
before she steps down from the board .
i thought jessica delaurentis
was the board .
she only joined because of my sister .
ali lived for that fashion show .
i should go .
martini me .
extra dry , extra olives , coming up .
hey , hanna .
hey , sweetheart .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
well , your father and i are
cooking up a little farewell fling .
mind setting the table ?
are you still leaving in the morning ?
yeah . thought it &apos;d be nice to have one last dinner ,
just the three of us .
so , what &apos;s for dessert ?
or are you saving that for your new family ?
you sure know how to walk a girl home .
so , what time do you need me tomorrow ?
after school ?
i &apos;ll know after the meeting .
you think you can build me some makeup tables ?
for you , i won &apos;t sleep until it &apos;s done .
good night .
good night .
you obviously have no control over the situation .
then what the hell is jason doing back here ?
hey , champ .
just get home ?
mm @-@ hmm .
hey , do we have any pretzels ?
um , melissa took them with her on the trip .
a week at a five @-@ star resort ,
and your sister cuts corners by bringing her own snacks .
you could &apos;ve gone , too , you know .
no way , i &apos;m too busy . who was that on the phone ?
oh , just some yahoo from
the junior league board asking for donations .
you sounded angry .
well , i told them i already bought
a dozen tickets to the fashion show .
don &apos;t we have anything salty ?
dad , you &apos;re not supposed to have salt .
you &apos;re not supposed to watch me so closely .
i &apos;ll be in my study if you need me .
this is jessica delaurentis .
please leave a message after the beep .
yeah , i took a business card ,
but i think i left it there in texas .
yeah , you &apos;ll probably find it under the bed .
can i talk to him ?
yeah , hang on . hang on one sec .
emily wants to talk to you .
hey . i wanna e @-@ mail you my paper before i hand it in .
next week .
do you have time ?
okay , perfect . thanks , dad .
i just miss him .
you were just in texas three days ago .
i know , but it wasn &apos;t easy leaving .
mom , what if you stayed with dad a little longer next time ?
you mean , like , for maybe a whole week ?
maybe until summer vacation .
honey , i can &apos;t leave you here by yourself .
mom , i &apos;m really busy right now .
i see you at breakfast , you hand me my lunchbag ,
and then i &apos;m gone until dinner .
i do my homework until way after you &apos;re asleep .
when you say it like that , i sound like a vending machine .
you &apos;re not a vending machine ,
but you &apos;re also not my chauffeur
or my baby @-@ sitter anymore .
i could stay with a friend
and then join you and dad in june .
you know what , i &apos;ll think about it .
okay .
thank you .
good night .
he was , like , yelling yelling .
slow down , i haven &apos;t had coffee .
kind of just wanted to drink it ,
not swim laps .
wait .
your dad was yelling at ali &apos;s mom ?
why ? did you ask him about it ?
yeah , but he , like , lied lied .
why would he lie ?
the real question is what &apos;s really going on with jason ?
he told me that he was
in that creepy house alone ,
but there was somebody else in that upstairs window ,
and i was not just imagining it .
but it wasn &apos;t ian .
okay , so who ? what ?
he &apos;s hiding something .
you don &apos;t paper over windows
unless you &apos;re a vampire .
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
maybe shutting out the world is just how he copes !
who knows what he &apos;s feeling right now .
well , apparently you .
i &apos;m just trying to be human , spence ,
okay , he lost his sister .
what ?
just got an e @-@ mail from ali &apos;s mom .
what does it say ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m too scared to open it .
do you think she knows that
i called and hung up last night ?
no .
i just got the same e @-@ mail .
why does ali &apos;s mom wanna have lunch with us ?
oh , they &apos;ve made some nice changes to the menu , haven &apos;t they ?
hanna , what are you gonna order ?
ahem , um , chinese chicken salad .
alison &apos;s favorite .
you must be really happy that jason &apos;s moved back .
happy ? i don &apos;t even think of that as our house anymore .
actually , we all thought jason moving back
was kind of odd .
jason came into family money ,
and it &apos;s his choice what to do with it .
he definitely marches to his own drummer ,
both my kids do . did .
you know what ?
i was gonna wait until after lunch , but ...
now i &apos;m thinking , &quot; why wait ? &quot;
did ali ever show you these ?
i know you like this one , em .
don &apos;t i look hot ?
those feathers are really pretty .
this stretch @-@ side is to die .
can i try it on ?
there &apos;s not that much stretch .
it &apos;s a nice haul , right ?
all one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind , and all mine ...
just like you guys .
she picked these out .
she did . and ...
it &apos;s a shame that she won &apos;t get to wear them .
you know , i gave so much away so fast .
ali &apos;s father thought that it would help ,
but there were certain things that i just couldn &apos;t ...
and when i heard that the four of you were doing the show ,
i thought , &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be nice if ali &apos;s dream
could be realized , at least , by her best friends ? &quot;
um , i don &apos;t really know what you &apos;re asking .
mrs. delaurentis ,
are you asking us to wear these ?
in the fashion show ?
ali would &apos;ve loved it .
it &apos;s the four of you that are keeping her memory alive .
please say yes .
i won &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because it &apos;s freaky . and weird !
we can &apos;t just march around in her clothes .
it feels like we just buried her .
alison never wore them .
well , she tried them on . freaky enough .
hanna , it &apos;s a tribute .
some pictures of ali , a couple songs that she liked ?
you get where her mom is coming from .
yeah , well , she needs to go back .
you don &apos;t need a degree to see that the woman &apos;s in pain .
she ordered a second bloody mary for her dessert .
yeah , that was her dinner .
well , she was sober enough to run it by the board ,
so we don &apos;t have much of a choice .
i &apos;ll let the student committee know .
do you want to take charge of photos ?
do we have to pass the pictures by her mom ,
make sure she &apos;s okay with the ones we choose ?
i could run them past jason .
i mean , it just might be easier for him , emotionally .
but are you sure you want to go to that house ?
i &apos;ll just ask him to meet me after school .
i don &apos;t know . you might not want to get him involved .
it &apos;s his sister . he already is .
hey , guys !
sorry i &apos;m late .
um , what &apos;s in the box ?
oh , the programs .
the programs , right !
um , can we sidebar ?
yeah .
um , we revamped the programs .
the glossy paper gives it a high @-@ end touch ,
don &apos;t you think ?
mm ! why didn &apos;t anybody tell me about this ?
i just folded , like , 100 of these .
you were gone , spencer . m.i.a.
okay , people thought you were going to jail .
was there anything else that i need to know ?
we finished stuffing swag bags ,
i arranged a piece on the show
in the rosewood observer style section .
oh ! and i got us a d.j.
great .
oh , it &apos;s okay if i play favorites , right ?
after all , i &apos;m committee chair !
oh ! sorry , since when ?
since you weren &apos;t here to vote .
listen , spencer , decisions had to be made .
i made them .
hold still .
okay , take it off .
you should come .
see your handiwork on the runway .
can you pass me that hanger ?
i would love to come , but , i , uh ,
i have plans with somebody tomorrow night .
you should bring your friend .
i have an extra ticket .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
okay .
you know , i can call jessica
if this makes you uncomfortable .
let me know if it &apos;s just all too much .
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just ...
lot of memories .
mom , do you think it &apos;s possible
for somebody to black out ,
where they don &apos;t remember a whole chunk of time ?
um , there may be a few nights in college
i don &apos;t remember all that clearly .
why do you ask ?
there &apos;s this guy ...
kind of a friend .
he &apos;s missing a whole night
when a lot happened .
my friends think it &apos;s convenient
that he can &apos;t remember where he was
or what he did .
well , sometimes people file things away
until they &apos;re ready to deal with them .
time can heal ,
and something shakes a memory loose .
i like this one .
yeah . thanks , mom .
what are you doing here ? you scared me .
i could ask you the same thing .
i &apos;m sorry , kid .
your mom gave me a spare key
in case you weren &apos;t here when i came by .
she &apos;s got a late meeting ,
and i offered to pick up dinner . hungry ?
yeah , but what are you doing here ?
delivering thai . thought you loved thai .
and i thought you left this morning
to go to your house where your fiancee lives .
i decided to stay for the weekend
so i could see your fashion show .
what &apos;s the point ? you &apos;re still leaving .
the point is that we always fight before i leave ,
and i &apos;m tired of ending every visit on a sour note ,
and when you got mad at dinner the other night ,
i thought maybe we should talk .
okay . talk .
hanna .
i miss being around for these kind of things ,
and i was kind of hoping you would be
a little more excited that i was here .
no , you &apos;re staying here
because you &apos;re still in love with mom .
it &apos;s her you &apos;re hanging around here for , not me .
your mom and i are getting along better .
yeah , what &apos;s with the whole
&quot; pals who drink martinis &quot; act ?
cooking dinner together ,
long talks on the patio ?
you &apos;re here more than you &apos;re at your hotel ,
and now you have a spare key ?
we &apos;ve turned a corner .
no , i see the way you look at her !
stop using me as an excuse .
hanna , there &apos;s nothing going on between us .
you can &apos;t even admit it , can you ?
hanna -- - you know what ? i &apos;ve got homework .
where was this one taken ?
i &apos;m not sure .
maybe at the hastings lake house ?
cool .
did my mother ask you to do this ?
what ? no .
yeah , kind of . why ?
just seems like something she would do .
this was , um ...
taken the day she got back
from your grandma &apos;s in georgia .
she came straight to emily &apos;s .
use it .
she looks happy there .
she went straight home after emily &apos;s
to get dinner and then change clothes
before spencer &apos;s party in the barn .
okay .
i @-@ i was just worried that if we used any pictures
from the day she disappeared that ...
i don &apos;t think anyone but you guys will know that .
really ? what about your mom or you ?
i don &apos;t remember anything from that day .
no ! i know that you said that ,
but i guess i just figured ,
since it was your last meal as a family that ...
aria , why am i here ?
i just thought you &apos;d be sensitive to anything
that might be a little difficult for your mom .
my mother and i live on different planets .
no , i get it .
but you must have some mory of that day .
i don &apos;t , okay ?
only the next day , when i was questioned by the police ,
and this is starting to feel a lot like that .
why are you accusing me all of a sudden ?
no , i &apos;m not !
what exactly is it you &apos;re looking for here ?
i &apos;m sorry .
this was probably a bad idea .
you &apos;re right . it was .
jason !
don &apos;t sweat it , okay ?
we all learn from our mistakes .
i just won &apos;t make this one again .
hold !
i said no flats , becky .
i need to be 100 % sure you can walk in heels .
mona , take it easy .
reset !
i think i feel a migraine coming on ,
so i &apos;m just gonna take a quick break .
do any of you guys have an extra ticket for tonight ?
did you change your mind about caleb ?
it &apos;s for my dad .
he &apos;s still in town ?
yep , and he &apos;s in no rush to get home to isabel .
what does that even mean ?
there &apos;s no way your mom and dad are getting back together .
aria montgomery !
less talking , more walking .
are your legs always that short ?
mona is five feet of insidious snark
with a side ponytail , and i just --
i wanna grab it ,
and i wanna yank it really , really hard .
spence , she stepped up while you dealt with some pretty big things ,
things that were way out of your control ,
but , look , maybe we should both enjoy the fact
that those pretty big things are over .
we can both take a breath .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
oh , did you figure out what &apos;s going on with your dad yet ?
it &apos;s not even worth a recap .
where &apos;s your dress ?
being delivered as we speak .
will you try it on ?
i trust you .
way too much .
i need to see how it falls .
she &apos;s not gonna let up until she knows that it &apos;s perfect .
hey , i &apos;m quinn .
hey , nice to meet you .
same here .
why don &apos;t you guys go take a seat while i get dressed ?
looks like a big crowd out there .
may end up sitting on your lap .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time , right ?
we &apos;ll be back in a few .
did they seem a little touchy @-@ feely to you ?
a little .
how come i have no date ,
and you have a date who brought a date ?
you have a date . you just didn &apos;t ask him to come .
donations are over here , and ...
enjoy your evening .
hi , welcome .
you look amazing .
thank you .
where &apos;s your headset ? here , just take mine .
i need you to track down the tribute slideshow disc
and give it to noel , okay ?
i want to -- - take a breath .
how can i just leave her ?
i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m struggling with .
i would feel like i &apos;m just quitting my job .
i think emily can handle it
if you let her .
well , i &apos;d really like to reconnect with wayne .
he &apos;s been gone for so long .
you &apos;d be surprised
how quickly you can settle back into your groove .
oh , look , there &apos;s jessica delaurentis .
this must be so hard for her .
noel .
do you want to take a final look ?
no , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
peter ...
you need to have control .
em , do you need help getting into your dress ?
i bet samara &apos;s gonna be here in a little bit .
i &apos;ve got it .
we need some bubbly .
i &apos;m gonna go hijack some champagne .
are you -- are you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
tom ?
don &apos;t beat yourself up .
hanna &apos;s sorting through a lot right now .
no ... no , that &apos;s my fault .
i keep crashing in and out of her life ,
unexpected .
can &apos;t patch a hole like that
with ginger stir @-@ fry .
you look great tonight .
thank you .
i never complimented you enough .
well , i wouldn &apos;t say it &apos;s the worst thing you ever did .
fair enough .
i feel like we &apos;re beyond that .
you do ?
yes . i really do .
ladies and gentlemen , please take your seats .
the eighth annual rosewood high
charity fashion show is about to begin .
each year ...
and plan their very own fundraising fashion show .
and each year , the city of rosewood
turns out to support our youth
as they give us their time , energy , and enthusiasm .
here to welcome you ...
i thought you were stealing champagne .
they were out .
... sharing lessons in generosity at rosewood high .
please give a warm welcome to mrs. jessica delaurentis .
do i look okay ?
that is one lucky dress .
emily , what &apos;s wrong ?
you and quinn are just friends , right ?
since the second grade .
we used to play dress @-@ up .
i was missus , and she was always mister .
would it bother you if i were seeing someone ?
not that i am , but if i were ?
i was just starting to feel like we may have something .
me too .
but we &apos;ve only been out a few times ,
and you didn &apos;t want to get too serious too fast .
right . i did say that .
i &apos;m gonna go get ready .
see you out there .
you okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
okay , last looks , people !
ladies , i need my first three models lined up !
i &apos;ll get your dress .
thanks .
i &apos;ll do touch @-@ ups .
i think i saw caleb out there .
caleb ? did you change your mind ?
i didn &apos;t ask him to come .
open .
so he just showed up ?
looking really hot .
hmm , didn &apos;t notice . blot .
hanna , he wants you back .
you want him back . what &apos;s the problem ?
we are not gonna be angry at you
if you give him a second chance .
you need more mascara .
spencer ! ! !
how do you not strangle her ?
hanna !
you look great , aria !
do it , hanna !
and aria !
spence , looking good !
there you go , spence ! nice , baby !
let &apos;s go , emily !
all right , spencer !
looking gorgeous , emily !
i love you , aria !
work it , hanna !
ladies and gentlemen , the rosewood high student committee
would like to take a moment
to pay tribute to one of their own ,
allison delaurentis .
wake up , everybody ,
because the bitch is back !
turn it off .
i can &apos;t .
do you see that ?
oh my gosh !
who will do that ?
did you speak to her ?
no , jason picked up her cell phone .
said she was too upset to talk .
just when we were in the spotlight doing something decent .
yeah , &quot; a &quot; makes the spotlight extra harsh .
i &apos;m just gonna ...
i &apos;m glad you came .
hey , what was that on stage ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can i walk you home ?
wait for me ?
maybe we should just send
mrs. delaurentis a note or something ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a section for
&quot; i &apos;m sorry you got traumatized &quot; cards .
maybe flowers .
can we get out of here ?
i &apos;m right behind you .
i just gotta grab my stuff .
did you want this back ?
i &apos;d hate to leave something lying around
that could get you and your friends in trouble .
i assumed that was yours .
what &apos;s that ?
the unplanned finale .
hand it over .
i was worried you didn &apos;t eat ,
so i brought you something .
honey , i &apos;m so sorry about what happened tonight .
i can &apos;t believe anyone would be that cruel .
they probably think that --
no , no one thinks you girls are responsible for that .
you could see it in your faces .
you guys were as stunned as the rest of us .
thanks .
mom , when you and dad were dating ,
did you see other people ?
well , we had that conversation very early on ,
but i made it clear that if it was gonna be me ,
it could only be me .
thanks .
you know , emily , when you mentioned
my leaving and you joining us in the summer ,
well , i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about that ,
and maybe it could work .
what ?
well , i spoke to hanna &apos;s mom ,
and she said that she could look after you .
you mean i could stay with them ?
if you want to .
to be honest , your dad and me being apart so much ,
it &apos;s really , really hard on us .
so you &apos;re saying i could stay in rosewood until i finish the semester ?
but only if you &apos;re comfortable , honey ,
only if you &apos;re comfortable ,
and if you have second thoughts --
no , i &apos;m fine . you should go .
you and dad need each other .
i took a lot of pictures .
you looked beautiful .
whoever hijacked that --
aren &apos;t you supposed to be at your hotel ...
packing ?
no . no , i &apos;m supposed to be right here making sure
you got home safely from what happened tonight .
mom &apos;s upstairs .
had to talk her down from forming up a posse on the way home .
so , what did happen tonight ?
i saw you with mom .
you were right .
i guess it took you yelling at me
before i could see it myself .
what does that mean ?
it means no more excuses .
it means i &apos;m not ready to go home yet .
there &apos;s some things i have to work out with your mom ,
and i can only do that if i stay here .
then i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
okay .
okay . see you tomorrow .
salty ?
sweet .
but don &apos;t tell your mother , okay ?
whoa , you look beat .
why don &apos;t you go get some rest ?
dad ?
yeah ?
what &apos;s going on between you and mrs. delaurentis ?
i saw you two together tonight ,
and you looked upset .
why do you care that jason &apos;s moved back ?
look , this isn &apos;t something for you to worry about , spencer ,
but for the time being , you stay away from jason delaurentis ,
all right ?
pretty sure your mom doesn &apos;t want this back .
how many times do we have to put her away ?
it &apos;s like burying alison all over again .
every time we start to make peace with it ,
someone has to go and say something ugly
about her death , about her life .
when are people gonna move on to gawk at the next tragedy ?
well , if i was a stranger ,
i &apos;d be fascinated with the dark details .
that &apos;s us .
brother , her friends .
we &apos;re the dark details .
why come back ?
why live in that house all by yourself ?
wanted to try and put the pieces together .
i was looking for something .
you still don &apos;t know who wrote that note .
what if it has to do with what happened that night ?
i have my answer .
ian ...
i mean , what if he -- - there are no ifs .
ian confessed .
look , from now i , i need to figure out how to be happy , and ...
i &apos;d like to do that here .
um ... can i drop you somewhere ?
yeah .
yeah , i could use a ride home .
