No, I just wanna say,
I'm really excited about the clinical trial.
I've been reading the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.
Germs. Disease. Toxins...
Our bodies encounter dangers all the time.
Just beneath the surface.
Hidden.
Whether you realize it or not,
your body is constantly protecting itself.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Why is the sperm donor here?
I thought tonight was a family dinner.
Dad, I...
To two extraordinary women,
may your lives be overfilled with love, happiness, and joy.
To Callie and Arizona,
the mothers of my child.
Oh, for God's sake, I...
Oh, Daniel. Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
Yes. There we go.
Do you ever go by anything other than Colonel,
Colonel?
The colonel.
Actually, um... we forgot to say grace.
Say what?
Yeah, we should-- we should say grace before we eat.
Of course. Shame on us.
Fork down, the colonel.
Mom, you want to lead?
Bless us, oh, lord, and these thy gifts...
Every time you blink your eye,
you wash away thousands of unwanted microbes.
Breathe in too much unwanted pollen and you sneeze.
Amen.
Okay. I'll go. I'll go get her. Excuse me.
Arizona, we sat next to a charming young man
on the plane today,
and he said he was going with his partner
to march in a parade.
For pride?
Yeah. Those are good.
The body knows when it's encountered something that doesn't belong.
Oh. She couldn't be cuter if she tried.
Mom, you haven't had a chance to hold her yet.
The body detects the invader,
it releases its white blood cells...
No, no, that's all right. Thank you, though.
I'm eating.
And it attacks.
This is Zola. She's 6 months old,
Born with spina bifida...
Adorable african children.
Shameless ego stroking...
Karev is a genius.
Yeah, he's single-handedly stealing chief resident
out from under all of us,
and we're helping him do it.
I mean, we can't exactly refuse to treat little sick kids
without making ourselves look bad.
Oh, he is a genius.
Or...
That's what they say in Swahili.
...spine to prevent any further brain damage...
Well, he only has a shot because I've been benched.
The playing field has been leveled. You're all welcome.
My Alzheimer's trial kicks African-orphan ass.
It kicks all of your asses.
Do you want to keep it down back there?
I'm trying to listen to what appears to be
the next chief resident talking.
Before we go, I just want to say thank you
to all of you for your participation.
It, uh, truly means more than I could say.
Slow clap. They're giving him the slow clap. Come on.
I'm not giving him the slow clap.
Okay, I want to personally check the incision sites,
any weight fluctuations,
the patients' glucose levels.
When was the last time you cleaned these cages, Avery?
A clean cage means a lower infection rate,
which means F.D.A. approval,
understood?
Cages. I got it, sir.
Makena? Hi, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Of course, you know Dr. Karev.
We're here to take a look at Zola today.
Uh, sometimes babies with spina bifida
can develop Chiari malformation.
It causes fluid build-up in the brain.
It could be pretty uncomfortable, but sometimes,
if you adjust the patient's head position--
it helps relieve the pressure.
Let me see this. Let me see this face.
We've had her at the orphanage
since she was 2 months old.
This is the first time she's stopped crying
since I can remember.
Let's just run an M.R.I.
and check to see if she has a Chiari malformation
or hydrocephalus.
If it's positive, we're gonna have to do a shunt.
Drain the fluid.
It's gonna postpone the spinal surgery,
but I think it's gonna be worth it.
I think she likes you.
She can keep that lamplight.
Sefu, I will be repairing
your brother's heart defect tomorrow while Dr. Sloan,
our head of plastics,
he will construct Kondo a new sternum.
He wants to know, if he dies,
could we wait to tell the family at home.
Our sister's birthday is tomorrow,
and he doesn't want to ruin it.
We are gonna take really good care of you. Okay?
And you are not gonna ruin your sister's birthday.
We have to look at his chest. Okay?
Sir.
Get off me! I told you that I'm fine!
I don't need any help.
Sir, please.
Sir, if you continue to try to get out of bed,
I'm gonna have to restrain you.
Get off me. Get off--aah!
B-52 cocktail.
Ought to calm him down.
Okay, listen, I need to get back
in the race for chief resident.
I need in on Teddy's pentalogy of Cantrell patient.
This isn't funny anymore. She is still shutting me out.
Can't you talk to her?
I thought you were on Robbins' service today.
Isn't she on that case, too?
Yeah, but that just puts me,
like, inches away from some other resident
doing the most amazing cardio procedure imaginable
while I just stand there and...
suction. It's torture.
You need to apologize.
Apologize for what?
For having better judgment than Teddy?
For saving Callie's life?
There's a wedding tomorrow because of me.
Your apology could use some work.
You asked me how to get back in with Teddy.
I'm telling you how.
Asha is 10 years old. She sustained internal injuries
six years ago from an explosive device.
She has multiple enterotomies.
And there are some strictures there
and some ascites.
She has not healed properly.
Boy, this complicates things.
As does the fact that she's H.I.V. positive.
She's living with A.I.D.S..
Hello.
Uh, don't be scared.
I'm just gonna take your blood pressure now, okay?
Mm. So--oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.
Um, we're-- we're here to help.
Help.
Let's get her on L.R. at maintenance
and start broad spectrum antibiotics.
Understand?
Help. Help.
Dr. Kepner...
Um, the antibiotics and the L.R.?
Oh, right. Sorry, Dr. Hunt. Right away.
You know, Dr. Kepner.
Yeah.
Perhaps if you spent a little more time just doing your job,
a little less time learning the new languages,
your attendings wouldn't have to repeat themselves.
Hold, please.
Dr. Altman, I would like to apologize.
I am... sorry
for going over your head
and putting you in a difficult position
during Callie's surgery.
I am sorry. I-I apologize.
Are you saying this because you mean it
or because you want back on my service?
Does it really matter?
Yes, it matters.
Here you go.
Thank you.
I, uh, I put together a schedule to, uh,
to help with the next two days.
Ah. Oh, by the hour, military time--wow.
Thank you, Colonel.
And I picked up a little something for Sofia.
Look at the little rosebuds.
Okay, Mom, baby clothes later.
Wedding rehearsal now. I've got 20 minutes
before I have to get back to the hospital.
Dad, where's the moment of silence?
Time is tight, Arizona.
I could not find a place in the ceremony for it.
Well, we have to light a candle for Timothy.
It's two minutes.
Timothy?
Oh, her brother.
Dad...
Sweetie, don't push it.
Okay, so the table is the altar,
and the lamp is...
Father Brooks.
Your priest?
Minister.
No, he's not catholic,
but he practices at a very big church.
It's--it's old and drafty. It's--you'll like it.
It's very churchy.
I see.
Okay, Mrs. Torres, you'll be over here in the front row.
Okay, and I know where you want me.
Right back here to walk my little girl down the aisle.
Sorry.
Sorry. Surgery ran long, but I'm here.
I made it. Where do you want me?
That is not where you will be.
Oh, this is your spot? Sorry.
Hey, Mark.
Why don't you stand over here next to me?
At least one of my fathers-in-law doesn't hate me.
You're Sofia's father.
I love Sofia, so I'm gonna at least try to like you.
But if you call me your father-in-law again,
I'll knock you out.
Okay.
So Arizona walks down the aisle first.
There she goes.
All right. And then I go.
And then I hand the bouquet to--
Mom... Can I hand you the bouquet?
Actually, I, um, I-I need to use the powder room.
Excuse me.
Well, I'd like some bouquet time if you don't mind.
I haven't had enough bouquet time today.
I mean, you'd think being on the chief's research project
would help in the race for chief resident.
You might even think it'd make me a contender.
Only I'm not saving little kids or people with Alzheimer's.
I'm cleaning up mouse poop.
Can you hand me that basin?
Wanna hear my conversation with the chief every morning?
"Avery, how are the mice?"
"Oh, they're fine, Chief.
They're running on their wheels.
They're eating their cheese."
If I worked at a pet store,
I'd be employee of the month by now.
But I'm a surgeon,
babysitting a bunch of mice.
Until you get F.D.A. approval,
okay, which, I'm sure you're gonna be
working on humans any day now.
Now grab me another plum.
Why are you peeling these things apart anyway?
I'm practicing.
Since my kid's skin
has grown directly onto the heart muscle,
I'm gonna be helping Teddy remove the adhesions
without puncturing the heart.
Hey! Don't eat my adhesions.
Oh, gross.
Okay, okay, look, I need 20 good reasons
why I shouldn't let Cristina back on my service today,
because I am ready to buckle.
I have got a really complicated case,
and I could use her skills today,
so 20 reasons, right now, please.
I don't have one reason.
Ugh. I think you should put her back on your service.
No. No.
That would be the worst thing that I could do.
I mean, that j--that won't teach her a thing.
She went over your head in a surgery.
Yes, that was bad form,
but don't you think you're being a little bit harsh?
Harsh?
Okay, first of all, she went over my head to you,
and you enabled that behavior,
which you really shouldn't have done.
But more importantly is,
Cristina is dangerous right now.
She got lucky. Callie survived that procedure,
but it just as easily could've been disastrous.
Cristina got lucky.
She doesn't see it that way.
She thinks she's right.
She always thinks she's right.
And that is not being a good doctor.
That is dangerous.
Tell her that.
Instead of just shutting her out, tell her that.
There's no telling Cristina Yang anything.
She has to learn it.
And until then, I am okay being the bad guy.
I can handle her being angry at me.
Do you really think that she can handle something
like killing Callie Torres?
So Zola doesn't have a Chiari malformation,
but she does have hydrocephalus.
Okay.
Let's book an O.R. for the shunt right away, okay?
Hey, what do you got for me? Any news?
Ugh. I went over all the screening tests,
but you need to start looking at
the next wave of patient charts.
Next wave?
The Alzheimer's trial.
The first wave of the trial is done.
Now we're getting ready to treat the next group.
Let me know when the O.R. is booked.
Mer, what's going on? Does he know what you did?
What did I do?
I saw you with the clinical trial envelope.
You were hiding it under your lab coat.
Look, if you messed with this trial somehow,
this could be bad for you-- like, really bad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whatever you did, no matter how minor,
it invalidates the entire project.
Alex--
You could get into real trouble here, Mer.
It's illegal to mess around with a blind trial.
I didn't do anything! So shut up about it.
Dr. Stark, can I talk to you?
Well, it appears you already are.
I-I have some concerns about Asha.
She hasn't eaten a bite of food since she arrived.
All right. Start her on parenteral nutrition.
I will, obviously, but more to the point,
the fact that she's not eating, not speaking...
Kepner.
She just seems really scared, and I...
You know,
unless the next piece of information from your mouth
relies on the words, uh, "lab results" or "vitals"
or "Code Blue," I don't care.
You promised.
You promised me that we could work together,
that it wouldn't be weird,
that you would treat me like any other resident.
I assure you, I am treating you
exactly the way I treat other residents.
It's a 9-1-1 on Asha.
Asha, what's wrong?
Okay, what happened?
Her blood pressure dropped out.
Her pulse was thready.
Somebody notify Hunt.
Help.
Okay, get me four units of packed cells...
draw a new C.B.C., coags, open up her fluids.
Kepner, get a gown.
I'm fine.
I need a central line kit right now.
Kepner.
I'm fine. I've got this.
Two more days.
We can handle two more days.
And then they'll be gone,
and our lives will go back to normal.
No more brunches. No more praying.
No more of my dad calling himself the Colonel.
We just need to focus on...
The big picture...
Yeah.
Which is...
You and I...
are getting married.
We're getting married.
We're getting married.
We couldn't stop the bleeding,
so we rushed her here.
Oh, what the hell?
It looks like wax.
I have never seen anything like this.
Nobody has, at least not in the States.
She has intestinal T.B. Poor kid.
There's adhesions everywhere.
It's hard to even know where to begin.
The perforation's pretty high at the lesser curvature.
We should treat it like a normal perf, right?
And then start the anti-T.B. meds?
The less aggressive we are,
the greater chance we can avoid
short gut syndrome.
引起的吸收不良和营养不良
Absolutely right, Kepner.
Let's start by ligating the bleeding vessel.
The trick is to go in very slowly
until you feel a little give,
And then you should see some fluid.
Got it.
Very nice. You know, I wasn't exactly pleased
when you decided to bow out of the trial.
Yeah, well--
But the work you're doing with the kids
is really impressive.
Thank you.
And you were right about Meredith being the right person
for the Alzheimer's trial all along.
I'm impressed. You are remarkably calm
for a bride who's getting married tomorrow.
Well, you should see the schedule
that my dad put together.
I just show up where I belong, when I belong. It's perfect.
Everyone should get married like this.
Who is that from, hottie husband or hottie boyfriend?
It's from Andrew, who is not my boyfriend.
He's just, uh, he's just my wedding date.
Uh-huh, and does your hottie wedding date
know about your hottie husband?
Well, there's nothing to know.
I mean, Andrew will be in town for another week,
And then he's off to who knows where.
So I'm just enjoying what he has to offer while he's offering.
Appropriate urinary output, normal weight reading,
and... running on the wheel.
Patient H., you're looking great.
Very good.
Patient I., what can I say?
Appropriate urinary output.
I cannot believe I am talking to mice like they're--oh, no.
No, no, no. Mouse J.
Mouse J.
Okay, so just pretend my hoodie's a gown. Okay?
And...
open your eyes.
What do you think?
I had it made to look like yours.
I-I can see that.
I have loved this picture since I was a little girl,
and I just wanted to surprise you.
I...It's--do you like it?
Okay, what, Mom?
What don't you like?
Well, n-nothing, nothing. It's...
It's lovely.
Lovely.
That's... it?
What else would you like me to say?
I don't know. Something.
I mean, I've been bending over backwards
since you first got here just to make you feel comfortable.
I didn't ask you to do anything for me.
I'm getting married in a church for you.
Don't you dare imply that there's anything
about a wedding to a woman or...
a baby out of wedlock that's for me.
Okay.
So what bothers you more, my bastard child
or my lesbian fiance?
You're a lawyer, Mom.
You're out in the world. You know other gay people.
Your secretary's gay.
I'm your daughter.
Do you know how devastating it is
to raise a child and to love a child
and know you won't see that child in heaven?
认为同性恋死后不能上天堂
Oh, Mom.
You are not a bride.
And I am not the mother of a bride.
And this...
this--this isn't your wedding.
It isn't right.
I'm sorry.
I can't be here. I just can't.
Sefu...
Didn't they get you a cot
so you could stay with your brother tonight?
I can't sleep.
Back home...
I have all of these sisters,
but Kondo...
he's my only brother.
And...
I don't want to lose him.
I know you don't.
I know.
You've apparently stopped answering your pages
in order to, what, join the kitchen staff?
I need those post-op reports.
Wet-to-dry dressing applied in 18-10.
Vitals stable in your Crohn's patient, post-op.
You were exposed to HIV Positive blood.
I suppose you've checked yourself for cuts.
I'm a doctor.
We get exposed to things all the time.
I know proper protocol.
And the sticky yellow mess here,
this took priority over reporting back to me because--
This sticky yellow mess is nsima.
It's a maize porridge,
which happens to be a staple
in most east-African countries.
I found the recipe online.
I'm not sure why Asha hasn't eaten in two days,
but I am sure that she's not used to eating
processed American food.
I don't expect you to care,
but when she is ready to eat after surgery,
she's gonna be hungry,
and she's used to corn porridge.
So while I can't make her talk,
I can't do anything about the fact that she is sick,
that she has advanced TB,
that she is a 10 year old living with AIDS.
I can do this.
I can make my patient something she might eat.
So unless you have more insults for me, Dr. Stark,
I'm a little busy now making porridge.
I-I tried to reason with her.
She won't listen.
She's just sitting downstairs in the car.
I don't...
I don't know what to say, sweetheart.
I'm--I'm so sorry.
Daddy, you need to go. Okay?
Go? I-I can't-- I'm not leaving--
You have to go, okay, because if you don't,
I will start crying,
and then that will make you feel bad,
and then I will feel worse, so you...
have to go.
Okay?
Okay.
Is there any milk over there?
Alex, is there any more milk?
So you're not talking to me now, is that it?
You told me to shut up,
so I'm just gonna sit here and read the cereal box
and practice keeping my mouth shut.
I didn't change any data or falsify any results.
Or switch a syringe so some sweet, sad old lady
would get the drug and not the placebo?
That's what I thought.
Nothing I did will change any results.
It doesn't change the potential effectiveness of the drug.
It doesn't change anything.
Except the life of the guy
who was supposed to get the drug and now won't.
Look, the truth will come out,
when the F.D.A. investigates,
they'll invalidate Seattle Grace
as a research institution.
That blacklist is you, Derek,
every fricking doctor in this hospital.
This is bigger than you.
It messes with me. It messes with everyone.
I mean, I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a liar.
I never thought you were, either.
So what are you saying, you're gonna tell?
Morning.
I'm late for work.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, good. Can I borrow something?
It can be anything, really--
a handkerchief, tissue, cash.
I've got something old, new, blue.
I just need something borrowed.
I just got a call from Father Brooks.
His wife got into an accident.
Oh. She's okay, but, uh, they're in the ER now.
He's not gonna make it to the wedding.
You're kidding.
Please tell me you're kidding.
Do you know how hard it was
to find a minister willing to marry us?
Well, he left me some numbers.
We can call for a replacement--
No, no, no. You know what? Don't make any calls.
Don't get anyone.
Just... forget it.
I'm not getting married.
Let's go.
Mouse J. here took a turn for the worse last night.
I did an X-ray.
It didn't show anything,
So I did a CT.
You did an X-ray and a CT on a mouse?
I mean, if there's anything in this CT.
I can't make it out.
I couldn't either,
which is why I did an MRI.
You did a CT and an MRI?
Avery, you have $8,000 worth of scans right here
for a rodent.
Yes, sir, I understand that,
but if you just look at the MRI.
Just look.
What do you see?
I see a-a little hernia.
And the portal vein's not draining very well.
Which means the problem isn't
the way the device functions.
It's where the device functions.
We just need to put it closer to the surface,
just underneath the skin.
Let's get started.
You paged?
Yeah. Zola, this is Meredith.
Meredith, this is Zola.
Here, can you hold her for a minute?
Uh, sure. Come here.
There. Okay.
Zola, can you smile for me?
Yeah. See? Her facial movements are intact.
Okay, look. Over here. See that?
Watch how she's tracking me. Over here.
Neuro exam is good, even after the shunt.
Great. Did something happen? Why did you page?
I need to ask you something, okay?
Okay.
Can you excuse us for a minute?
Yes, doctor.
I need you to be completely honest with me. Okay?
If Alex said something to you--
Let's adopt this baby.
What? Are you serious?
Yeah.
You know, I was holding her yesterday,
And she was crying, and then she stopped.
And I've--I've held a lot of babies.
I've fixed a lot of babies, but I looked down at Zola--
I don't know what it was. I just--
I just couldn't imagine her being with any other parent
or any other family.
We've been trying so hard to start a family,
and--and she needs one.
Let's adopt her. I'm serious.
Let's adopt her.
You realize your door is unlocked?
I could be anyone.
I could be...a burglar coming to burgle you.
Where is the baby?
I could be a baby-napper trying to baby-nap you.
I know why they sent you.
And it doesn't matter what you say.
The wedding's still off.
My mom's right.
It's a joke.
It's not a wedding and it's not happening.
Oh, Callie.
I can't have a priest.
I no longer have a minister.
I'm not being given away by my dad.
The wedding isn't legal.
What's the point?
This isn't a wedding. It's not even in a church.
It's nothing.
It's a couple of girls playing dress up.
It's not real.
It's not real.
J--okay.
First of all, you do not need the law
or a priest or your mother to make your wedding real.
And--and the church is...
The church can be anywhere you want it to be--
i-in a field... on a mountain,
right here in this room,
anywhere--because where do you think God is?
Come on. He's in you.
He's in me.
Just right here, in the middle of us.
Now your--your church just hasn't caught up to God yet.
Your mother...
She hasn't caught up to God yet.
And by the way...
she may not ever catch up,
but it's okay.
It's okay.
If you are willing to stand up
in front of your friends and family and God
and commit yourself...
to another human being,
to--to give of yourself in that kind of partnership,
for better or worse, in sickness and health,
honey, that is a marriage.
That is real,
and that's all that matters.
Besides...
girl, I got legally married to a man in a church.
Look how well that turned out.
You ready for me yet?
Just about.
Okay, Grey, time to repair the V.S.D.,
through the diverticulum.
Can I have a little suction here, please?
Thank you.
All right, there's a small defect
at the neck of the diverticulum.
Grey, pull up on your pickups so I can get in there.
Hold the graft.
Are you gonna use an 11-blade to make the incision?
No, she's going in blind.
5-0 suture.
All right. I'm sewing in the graft.
Grey, would you like to tie off when I finish?
Y-yes. Yes.
We addressed all the strictures and adhesions
without sacrificing much of the intestines at all.
Hell of a save.
So, Dr. Hunt,
I understand you've been put in charge
of determining the next chief resident.
With input from all of the attendings obviously.
All right. Well, in that case,
I'd like to talk to you about April Kepner.
I think if you check my file, you'll see that I rarely give
formal feedback about my residents.
When I do, it is almost exclusively negative.
That said,
I'd very much like to recommend April Kepner
for the chief resident position.
She goes above and beyond for her patients
even when she isn't asked.
Well, especially when she isn't asked.
She sees the patient as a whole,
not just as a set of symptoms.
I'll tell you, that kind of caring, that can't be taught.
So I think this hospital would be lucky to have her
as the next chief resident.
Hmm. Well, thank you, Dr. Stark. Yeah.
That's very good to hear.
Are you sure he's still breathing?
I'm sure, yeah.
I couldn't have done this without you today, Avery.
Any of this.
I really appreciate your dedication to these mice
and this project--
Whisker twitched.
His whisker twitched!
O-okay, okay.
Come on. Come on.
All right.
Come on.
Come on, yeah.
We did it! He's back!
Mouse J. is back, baby!
Uh, yeah. Excellent work.
Keep this up, you may be getting your own slow clap.
Robbins, babysitter's here. Sofia's asleep.
I look great, by the way.
Let's go.
Robbins, you okay?
When I came out to my brother,
he asked me if that meant that I was gonna marry a chick.
And when I said yes, he got this b-big smile,
and he said,
"I'm gonna dance so hard at your wedding."
My dreams are coming true--
Dreams I didn't even know that I had--
but my brother's not here.
He's missing it.
And I know that I'm late. I know it. I know it.
But why do you think that my dad schedules
every minute of every day?
If every minute is accounted for,
then there's no time to slow down and just...
I just...
I need a minute to miss my brother.
Look at this list--
blood work, financial statements,
a home study, I mean, fire alarms.
And this is all just to see if the U.S.C.I.S. thinks
that we're suitable to adopt.
Look, if you don't want to do this--
No, I do. She could be our little girl.
She will be.
Look, don't get overwhelmed, okay?
We're gonna take this list one step at a time,
One day at a time, okay?
In fact, look, I can see something we could cross off today.
Look right here.
I told you, I don't want to do that.
Well, it's for the baby.
Okay, you ready?
I am.
Okay, then. Let's get married.
It's my own damn fault.
Had I minded my own business,
the wedding would be canceled,
and I'd be home looking at TV by now.
You're gonna be fine.
You're doing great. Come on.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Right here. All right.
You can let go of my hand now.
All right.
All right.
Don't trip. Don't trip. Don't--
You're not gonna trip.
You're right. I won't.
Okay.
Um, who gives this bride to this bride?
That'd be me.
Applicants Grey and Shepherd.
That'd be us.
There you go.
Need to see some I.D.
Here it is. Sure.
Okay, this seems to be in order.
I'll jump right in.
Uh, we are here today to participate
In a marital union...
to celebrate, uh, love and happiness
and loyalty, and well, in my opinion,
a little bit of magic...
Acting in conformity to the laws and regulations
of the State of Washington...
To bring together two exceptional
and beautiful human beings.
Since it is your intention to enter into marriage,
join hands and repeat after me,
I, uh, Derek Shepherd...
I, Derek Shepherd...
I take you, Calliope Torres,
to be my wife...
For better or for worse, in good times and bad...
I choose you to be the one with whom I spend my life.
Do you have some token you wish to exchange?
No, we didn't have time to get rings.
Okay, we'll skip that part.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay,
you sign there, and you sign there.
By these acts and according to the laws
of the State of Washington...
Okay, I hereby pronounce you
wife and wife.
Congratulations.
Well, thank you.
Next applicants, please.
First dance!
So what happened with Teddy?
Did you talk to her?
So my date just called
to say she got stuck delivering a baby.
Literally--the baby got stuck halfway out.
I was wrong to doubt the mice.
Karev, watch your back,
'cause Mouse J. has just made me a contender.
Thank you, Mouse J.
To Mouse J.
You're not the only contenders, you know?
My sources tell me that Kepner could be a dark horse.
Oh, please.
No offense, Dr. Hunt, but, uh,
I have you scheduled for a swenson procedure
on a 2-year-old orphan tomorrow morning.
I'm sure you understand.
I'm just looking out for the kids
that I brought here from Africa.
Any idea when they're cutting the cake?
I wanted to take a piece to Adele.
Oh, I have no idea, sir.
You know, it's funny how things work out.
Karev stepped up.
Jackson's starting to shine.
There's Kepner, Grey.
I always assumed that you would be
the front-runner for chief resident, Yang.
But, uh, it just goes to show--
you can't count anyone out.
I'm gonna check on that cake.
You want a real apology?
Can't this wait till work tomorrow?
'cause my date's waiting for me.
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm such an exceptional surgeon
that it threatens you.
I'm sorry my surgical repair saved
Callie's life and yours didn't.
I'm sorry your ego is so fragile
that I had to stand on the sidelines of a surgery
I should have been performing with you today,
like I have been standing on the sidelines
for the past three months,
basically ruining my chances for chief resident.
You want sincerity?
I could not be more sincere.
And yet...
you still don't get it.
My glass is empty again.
I, uh, I have a proposition for you.
Mm. I like the sound of that.
I've been offered a position at Landstuhl Medical Center.
In Germany? Wow.
Uh, wow. That's, uh...
That's an amazing facility.
The position they offered me is permanent.
So I accepted on one condition.
That they find an opening for my incredibly talented
cardiothoracic surgeon girlfriend.
Andrew--
I live a nomadic life.
And it's never bothered me till now.
I want to settle down.
I want to start a life with someone,
and I'm hoping that that someone is you.
Just when we think we've figured things out...
the universe throws us a curveball.
All right, it's now time to clear the dance floor
and make way for the father-daughter dance, folks.
Oh, crap. I forgot to take that off the schedule.
I-I meant to. I'm sorry. It can--
No, no, no, no, no.
Of course you should get to dance with your dad. It's okay.
I'll just sit this one out.
Okay.
Go ahead.
No, you won't. I'm a father.
I can dance. Let's dance.
So we have to improvise.
We really need to leave
if we're even gonna make an appearance.
Oh, come on. Just one more minute.
You said that 20 minutes ago.
Listen to her. Listen to her. Look at her.
Come on. Listen to that.
We're not gonna make the wedding, are we?
They'll understand.
We'll get 'em a really nice present.
Right? Look at you. Come on. Look at her.
Look at her.
We find happiness in unexpected places.
May I cut in?
She's all yours.
We find our way back to the things that matter the most.
I was driving to the airport with your mother,
And it hit me--
I've been looking forward
to dancing with you on your wedding day
since I first held you in my arms,
so I turned the car around and came back.
So here I am
to have this dance wth my daughter.
The universe is funny that way.
Sometimes it just has a way
