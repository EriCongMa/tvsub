gloria , honey !
i &apos;m ready whenever you are !
we should hurry . the reservation &apos;s at 7 : 00 .
claire , where are you ?
okay , see you in two .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m striking a seductive pose for your mother .
gross . but i like the suit . is that new ?
oh , yeah .
now that his honey gots her own money ,
daddy went and snagged hisself some new threads , girl .
hands down , your funniest voice .
bordering on the offensive .
listen , i &apos;m a realtor ,
and i work a lot with families ,
so normally , i dial the sexy back to five ,
but claire &apos;s been working very hard lately .
so tonight ...
stick around if you want to see
your mom &apos;s tongue fall out of her mouth .
not unless you want to see my lunch fall out of mine .
oh , i &apos;m sorry i am late .
traffic was horrible .
sounds like someone could use a tall drink of water .
yeah , right . water .
luke , what did i tell you about
leaning back on that thing ?
i don &apos;t know . &quot; don &apos;t &quot; ?
honey , what are you still doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be babysitting joe .
yeah , but i have to drop off alex to watch lily first ,
and she &apos;s still not ready .
she can &apos;t be concerned about her looks , right ?
i can hear you !
i &apos;m kidding .
i &apos;m just saying ,
it &apos;d be sad to think she actually tries .
heard that , too !
it was a joke !
man , do big ears actually hear better ?
oh , my god , just stop talking .
okay , girls .
it &apos;s time for you guys to hit the road .
okay , bye .
oh , yeah , bye .
bye .
why aren &apos;t you going with them ?
he wanted to stay home .
i said it was okay .
by himself ?
it &apos;s fine .
if he &apos;s old enough to watch &quot; the walking dead &quot; with me ...
he &apos;s not .
then he &apos;s old enough
to stay home alone .
he &apos;s not .
claire , he &apos;s not a little boy anymore .
i &apos;m fine .
see how deep his voice is ?
are you okay ? !
oh , this is haley .
&quot; be there in 5 . alex took ducking forever . &quot;
oh , it &apos;s fine . you know what ?
we have to pick the &quot; save the date &quot; card .
i &apos;m at a loss .
can we just do it tomorrow ?
i hate the way my dad looks at us when we &apos;re late ,
like we &apos;re two silly queens
blasting disco music ,
primping , losing track of time .
wow , it gets really busy in that head , huh ?
okay , quick . which one do you like ?
uh , that one .
really ?
i think you picked too quick .
no , i didn &apos;t . i really like that one .
i really like this one .
well , then , why did you ducking ask me ?
fine , goes with yours .
well , if that &apos;s the one you really like .
can you just get ready ?
yeah . lily , hit it .
on it !
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
i &apos;ve never seen you so excited about a restaurant .
i &apos;ve waited six weeks for this reservation .
they have an australian wagyu beef
that &apos;s supposed to change your life .
in the way heart disease changes your life ?
because you &apos;re a pillar of health .
they only feed this cow alfalfa , barley , and red wine ,
and some chef hand @-@ picks each cut ,
dry ages it 35 days
before cooking it to a perfect medium @-@ rare ,
all for me .
doesn &apos;t the wine make the cow drunk ?
it &apos;s not &quot; the far dide . &quot; the cow doesn &apos;t drive anywhere .
gloria !
let &apos;s go !
you know she &apos;s not here , right ?
what ?
she &apos;s having her hair blown out .
that &apos;s a thing ?
that i pay for ?
gloria &apos;s always late .
then i get mad and tell her to hurry .
we yell , and it just takes longer .
so i promised myself , no matter how late she is ,
just to take some deep breaths and stay calm .
that &apos;s the only thing i learned in lamaze class
because we were always late .
hi ! everybody &apos;s running like crazy tonight .
i took san vicente thinking that i was gonna save some time ,
but then they &apos;re working on the sewer .
so i went around montana ,
down moreno .
but then there &apos;s that dip in the road .
i always forget about that dip in the road .
i hit it so hard that i spilled the coffee all over the car .
did i tell you who i had coffee with ?
i think luke is scared to be left in the house alone ,
and he &apos;s just pretending to be brave for you .
honey , he &apos;s 14 .
we left alex alone when she was 10 .
we didn &apos;t leave her . we forgot her .
and when we got home , she was fine .
physically .
plus , she &apos;s still friends with
that sweet 911 operator .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
making sure luke knows
what to do in case of emergency .
of course he does .
someone &apos;s at the door !
luke , it &apos;s just your mom testing you .
don &apos;t worry , mom .
if i hear that while you &apos;re gone ,
i won &apos;t answer .
i &apos;ll just hide where no one can find me .
cam , come on , let &apos;s go .
two seconds .
i thought that being with a man
meant that i wouldn &apos;t have to wait around like this .
i feel cheated . i do .
let &apos;s play dolls .
actually , i want to read you one of my favorite books .
it &apos;s called &quot; little women , &quot; and it &apos;s about four sisters
who overcome poverty and the patriarchy ...
nope ! dolls .
this is ashley . she &apos;s a wife .
well , i hope that &apos;s not the only thing that defines her .
does she have a career ?
nope , she shops . where &apos;s haley ?
how come it takes me five minutes to get ready ,
and you take forever ?
oh , please . i could get ready in five minutes , too ,
if i dressed like --
you did it again .
not changing .
fasten your seatbelts .
it &apos;s going to be a crazy night .
no , honey , it &apos;s gonna be a bumpy night .
remember , you can &apos;t have two dads
and make that mistake .
bumpy night .
okay , so how often does this happen ?
too often .
men just don &apos;t have that many options .
i can &apos;t tell you the number of times
i &apos;ve walked by a women &apos;s boutique
and just thought , &quot; what i would do
to have that many choices . &quot;
don &apos;t ever say that again .
i don &apos;t like any part of it .
all right , one of us has to change .
we look like twin toddlers at church .
yeah , tell me about it .
and this place we &apos;re going is supposed to be super hip .
we &apos;re probably gonna run into someone .
and come on . i don &apos;t have that many outfits .
my clothes take up exactly one @-@ quarter of the closet .
that &apos;s not fair . my clothes are bigger than yours .
all right , i hate to play this card ,
but i was dressed first . so ...
oh , that is silly .
lily , it &apos;s time to play &quot; who wore it best ? &quot;
no , i &apos;m not doing this again . i can &apos;t .
fine . alex .
uh , i don &apos;t know .
boys &apos; clothes aren &apos;t really my thing .
really ?
i don &apos;t get it .
doesn &apos;t the wine get the cow drunk ?
thank you .
honest to god .
have neither of you seen a cow ?
they &apos;re huge .
i bet tequila would do it quicker .
it &apos;s not the goal to get the cow drunk .
you got to be kidding me .
manny , see why your mother &apos;s taking so long .
and don &apos;t tell her i sent you .
mom ! hurry !
don &apos;t yell . i could have yelled .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
because i didn &apos;t want to yell .
i want you to go .
why can &apos;t you go ?
why can &apos;t you do what i ask ?
i &apos;m trying to do something new here !
stop yelling , jay ! i &apos;m ready !
oh , geez .
haley , manny knows where all the baby stuff is ,
and if joe won &apos;t go to bed ,
just put on gladys knight
and bounce him around a little bit .
oh , you still do that ?
i loved when you did that with us .
how about that ?
somebody in this family remembers a nice thing i did .
i remember something nice you did .
you bought me this dress yesterday when you were working .
how do i look ?
gorgeous . let &apos;s go !
you didn &apos;t even look at me . haley .
well , &quot; a , &quot; your hair looks amazing ,
like you just got off a horse .
that &apos;s exactly what i was going for .
but if i had one thought ...
no ! no thoughts .
... are those for sure the best earrings ?
they seem to be kind of getting lost .
i have the same color in a bigger size .
how much bigger ?
like a meter .
a meter ? that &apos;s like a foot .
actually , it &apos;s like a yard .
oh , sorry -- it &apos;s like a millimeter .
you mean a centimeter .
all this math . just show me .
gloria !
what ?
i think the new earrings
are really gonna tie your whole outfit together .
you &apos;re so sweet !
wow . that was very mature of you .
yeah , well , i &apos;m a lot older now
than when she started getting dressed .
so this sound ...
... that &apos;s the doorbell .
that other sound was the smoke alarm .
got it .
okay , and if you &apos;re hungry , don &apos;t order a pizza .
they don &apos;t screen those delivery guys .
half of them are ex @-@ cons .
stop it . you &apos;re gonna scare him . it &apos;s gonna be fine .
but if you do choke , you &apos;ve gotta throw yourself
against the back of a chair to get the food out .
he &apos;ll just drink stuff .
nothing from under the sink .
even if it &apos;s lemony ?
i &apos;m just messing with you .
in case of fire , go low and get out .
in case of earthquake --
wait . you think there could be an earthquake ?
the last time we had one , that big cabinet fell on me .
no , it didn &apos;t .
it did ? !
let &apos;s go .
bye , honey , we love you .
do you have the keys ?
we &apos;re gonna check in . i promise !
uhh , what &apos;s going on ?
new suit ?
this old thing ?
yes , it is .
i got it at this hipster place downtown .
you like it ?
it &apos;s tight .
well , the salesman said it was the style ,
and he looked like a mumford and son ,
so i think he &apos;d know .
mm , let &apos;s go .
slow down , flo jo .
you know what ? we don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;ll just change .
well , now i feel bad . let &apos;s both just change .
that &apos;s the fair thing to do .
okay , fine . but quickly , plemony snicketlease .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s blue .
yeah , this one &apos;s so yellow .
oh , you know what ?
i have a stain on this one . i can &apos;t wear it .
oh , paisley , yeah . i don &apos;t know .
are you kidding me right now ? !
what ?
i know this trick , cam .
you take forever to pick out an outfit ,
knowing very well that i &apos;ll say , &quot; let &apos;s just go , &quot;
because we &apos;re late .
meantime , you get credit for offering to change
while i &apos;m the one who actually does .
as usual .
excuse me .
are you accusing me of manipulating you to get my way ?
actually ...
because that &apos;s what my mother used to accuse me of ,
and i got to say
that that brings up a lot of stuff with me .
you &apos;re crying without tears .
give me a minute .
&quot; &apos; christmas won &apos;t be christmas without any presents , &apos;
&quot; grumbled jo .
&apos;it &apos;s so dreadful to be poor , &apos; sighed -- &quot;
stop ! i hate this .
can i put makeup on you ?
why does everyone ask me that ?
let &apos;s just have a good time tonight , all right ?
i &apos;m not mad .
okay , good .
and you do look super @-@ duper handsome in that .
don &apos;t even .
i &apos;m gonna grab a water for the road .
yeah , get me a soda .
okay , alex . thank you so much .
have a fun night .
honey , we love you .
here you go .
all right . thank you .
okay , and remember , no eating in the living room .
aah ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
what did you do ? what did you do ? !
come on ! you can &apos;t possibly think --
you shook this can
so you could wear the outfit that i wanted to wear ?
that is exactly what i think !
that is insane .
you saw me take it from the refrigerator
and bring it to you .
did i ?
or were you out of my sight for the two seconds
that it took you to get from the refrigerator to here ,
which would have given you exactly the right amount of time
to shake the can ?
nice theory , nancy grace , but i &apos;m not that petty .
okay , you two . did you see anything ?
just pretend you &apos;re coloring .
okay , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to reach the mirror .
i got something in my eye .
hi , you &apos;ve reached the dunphys .
why isn &apos;t luke picking up ?
it &apos;s hard to reach the phone
when you &apos;re tied up by a recently paroled pizza guy .
ha ha . you &apos;re very funny .
what are you doing ?
i know it sounds weird .
call it mother &apos;s intuition ,
but i just have this feeling that something is wrong .
fine , do what you want ,
but i &apos;ve just about had it up to --
higher than here with this .
die , pizza man !
stop ! stop !
oh . sorry , mom .
told you he could take care of himself .
move .
why does she do this ?
we &apos;re gonna lose our table .
she knows how important it is to me to be on time .
this is torture .
i think you &apos;ve lost perspective , jay .
you know what i would give to wait around
for a woman like that ?
reel it in , creepy .
that &apos;s your mother up there .
sorry , sorry .
once i changed the earrings , i had to change the shoes .
and then i tried on one of gloria &apos;s old dresses ,
which made me feel like a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
ay , your body &apos;s beautiful .
i agree .
take it outside the family .
okay , we ready to go ?
wait . i have the wrong lipstick .
oh ! that &apos;s it ! i &apos;ve had it !
just one minute !
nothing takes a minute with you .
we &apos;re leaving right now .
i don &apos;t care what you have to do .
it &apos;s bad enough you &apos;re being rude to me ,
but you &apos;re being rude
to the people sitting there waiting for us !
sorry , you &apos;re the first to arrive ,
and we can &apos;t seat you till everyone &apos;s here .
i hope you &apos;re happy !
where the hell is everybody ?
yes , i hate waiting like this .
do you ?
just because everybody else is late
doesn &apos;t make it okay for us to be late .
i can &apos;t get ready fast with all the yelling !
i wasn &apos;t yelling .
you see , you &apos;re doing it again !
gloria , you do this every single time .
if you know how long it takes you to get ready ,
why don &apos;t you start earlier ?
i have my reasons .
i would love to know them .
you &apos;re going to be mean .
i promise i won &apos;t be .
i like to make an entrance .
what &apos;s that , now ?
i like the part where i go in ,
and everybody &apos;s waiting for me ,
and they say ,
&quot; gloria , you look so pretty ,
and that dress is so beautiful . &quot;
is that so bad ?
i don &apos;t love it .
oh , this room is so nice .
i know . it &apos;s almost as gorgeous as -- you monster !
what ? oh , this ?
well , you know , you couldn &apos;t wear it ,
so i figured , what &apos;s the harm ?
mm . okay , you know what ? i will go over there ,
and i will be as socially magnetic as i always am .
we will put this on the back burner ,
but underneath , i want you to know , i am fuming .
hey , jay , where &apos;s gloria ?
she &apos;s -- she was there a second --
there are my boys !
gloria , you look so pretty .
that dress is so beautiful .
you got to be kidding me .
you let him watch those scary shows with you ,
and then we leave him home alone at night .
of course he &apos;s gonna arm himself .
he was fine until you gave him your &quot; 50 ways to die &quot; speech .
what was the one about the welcome mat ?
they are highly flammable .
for seven to ten people a year ,
they may as well say , &quot; welcome to the morgue . &quot;
you know what ? drop it .
i don &apos;t want to fight in public .
it &apos;s embarrassing .
fine .
hi , how are you ?
good evening . good .
oh , my leg &apos;s asleep !
my leg &apos;s asleep ! okay , thank you .
sir , if the rest of your party doesn &apos;t arrive soon ,
we have to give up your table .
any minute .
again , dad , sorry we &apos;re late .
yeah , you know , mitchell put on some music ,
and we were primping and dancing around ,
and i guess , well , we just lost track of time .
actually , dad , what happened
was cam was practicing this trick
where he pretends to be accommodating
and then magically gets his way .
there they are .
we need a second .
oh , cam , no .
where are you guys going ?
can &apos;t talk . too mad .
oh , god .
hi , dad .
where &apos;s gloria ?
she -- for the love of --
there you are !
oh , my goodness ! that dress !
gloria , holy mackerel .
we &apos;re so sorry we &apos;re late .
we had to drop luke off at your place .
phil wanted him to stay home alone , but he got scared .
man , i can &apos;t wait to get some food
in my mouth and yours .
poor haley .
what is she going to do with all those boys ?
* i &apos;ll be with him *
* i know you will *
* on that midnight train to georgia *
* leaving on the midnight train to georgia *
you know what ?
i resent the implication that i always get my way .
really ? the &quot; save the date &quot; cards .
for our wedding ?
oh . so , it is still our wedding .
i wasn &apos;t sure i was even invited
because you keep asking for my opinion
and then doing the exact opposite .
that &apos;s one thing .
what about the music ?
i think our love deserves a band , not a d.j.
the tablecloths .
they make sneakers out of that fabric .
you won &apos;t let me pick one thing , and you want to know why ?
because i have better taste than you .
i was gonna say because you &apos;re a control freak .
and how can you think that i have bad taste ?
we chose the exact same outfit .
did we ?
i wore fun loafers .
you wore sensible oxfords .
your collar &apos;s buttoned down .
mine &apos;s a more current widespread .
and i chose a bold pocket square
to bring out the stripe in the shirt ,
all of which you wouldn &apos;t have thought of .
because , well , i &apos;ve already said .
you don &apos;t like my oxfords ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m being harsh .
they &apos;re fine .
thank you .
for a small @-@ town detective .
okay , look . i can &apos;t help myself . i did it again .
so , i @-@ i don &apos;t love them .
but i do love you .
and i don &apos;t want you to feel left out .
okay . then let me have a say in planning our wedding .
that &apos;s what we agreed to .
you will , and you should , and i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
can you just do one thing for me ?
sure .
just be honest , and i &apos;ll let this go forever .
did you shake that can ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
see , phil ?
they don &apos;t let manny stay home alone .
why do you think haley &apos;s there ?
actually , we let manny stay home all the time ,
and sometimes , he makes cupcakes ,
which i could use one right about now --
or a potato .
haley &apos;s there to take care of joe .
are you sure , guys ?
&apos;cause claire &apos;s always right about everything
all the time , forever and ever .
thank god . here they are .
fiona , we &apos;re all here .
actually , dad , we could use a moment .
i &apos;m going to eat my hand .
&quot; jo immediately sat up ,
&quot; put her hands in her pockets , and began to whistle .
&quot; don &apos;t , jo . it &apos;s so boyish . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why i do it . &quot;
&quot; i detest rude , unladylike girls . &quot;
&quot; i hate affected , niminy @-@ piminy chits . &quot;
okay , this stinks . i give up .
thank god .
want to see your hair ?
lily , that &apos;s actually good .
can you really do makeup ?
stay there .
is it really too much to ask that you consult me
before you make such a big decision ?
claire , when you went back to work ,
you asked me to take the reins .
so i think you need to trust me now .
do you really think i &apos;d put luke in a dangerous situation ?
he &apos;s my favorite , which i did not just say .
if anything happens to him ...
it won &apos;t .
if you haven &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m pretty good at this ,
as hard as it is for you to pay me a compliment .
where is that coming from ?
well , do you like this suit ?
i wouldn &apos;t know
because all you said was , &quot; it &apos;s tight , &quot;
and not in a cool black way .
wait , a @-@ are you trying to say
that you squeezed yourself in that for me ?
yes .
you &apos;ve been a little distracted at work ,
so i wanted to look nice for you .
oh , honey .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re right .
luke probably would have been fine ,
and i am having a hard time letting go .
and if there &apos;s one person in the world i trust , it is you .
and ?
and ... you look hot in that suit .
when we get home later ...
okay , you &apos;re actually gonna need to stop .
this suit can &apos;t get any tighter .
hey , we &apos;re back .
nobody goes anywhere .
everybody hold hands , and we go right to the table .
fiona ?
actually , we just gave away your table .
i &apos;m sorry , but i did warn you about this .
listen to me , fiorina .
this man has been waiting
to eat in this restaurant for months !
we were all selfish , and we made him late .
and maybe i got a little crazy ,
but i &apos;m gonna think about that later .
but he has done nothing wrong !
so we &apos;re not gonna leave this place
until he eats that drunk cow
that he can &apos;t shut up his mouth about !
why you haven &apos;t moved ?
last night , i had the greatest meal i &apos;ve ever had ,
and it never would have happened
if gloria hadn &apos;t got us kicked out
of that snooty restaurant .
tacos .
tacos .
i need a taco .
yes .
taco truck !
that is delicious .
no , but seriously , who looks better ?
i don &apos;t know if it was the six scotches i drank
waiting for everybody ,
or the fact that i hadn &apos;t eaten anything since breakfast ...
or the moment phil &apos;s suit finally gave up .
they even played my favorite song .
* he &apos;s leaving *
* leaving *
* on that midnight train to georgia *
* leaving on the midnight train *
* said he &apos;s going back to find *
* going back to find *
* the simpler place and time *
* oh , yes , he is *
* and i &apos;ll be with him *
* yes , he will *
* on that midnight train to georgia *
a train i &apos;d never make
unless i told gloria it left at 11 : 00 .
* i &apos;d rather live in his world *
* than live without him in mine *
here you go .
i didn &apos;t know what you wanted to drink ,
so i just got you this soda .
that &apos;s fine . thank you .
cam , what did you do ?
i did exactly what you did
because i know you so well .
i didn &apos;t shake the soda .
then you have nothing to worry about ,
so go ahead and open it .
i shook it , okay ?
i shook the soda . i shook it up !
are you happy ?
it was petty and stupid and awful .
i &apos;m sorry .
