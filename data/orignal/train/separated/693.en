My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death...
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
You must go now.
Conrad is a ruthless man. You are not safe.
I shouldn't have chosen Victoria over you.
Lydia Davis found a photo of a Grayson party.
I was in the background.
Pre-Emily Thorne/ Amanda Clarke.
Emily announced that she's with child.
I'm thrilled.
She's lying.
Emily's having my baby. I'm sorry.
Good-bye, Danny.
I'll slip it back into Victoria's closet
before she ever knows about it.
Once it's covered in gunshot residue.
Your wedding is tomorrow. I won't be in attendance.
I'm sorry.
While I admire your determination, Ems,
shouldn't getting Victoria to your wedding today
be your sole focus right now?
I've come too far to let her win.
I'll be damned if she robs me my wedding day.
You know, there are more direct ways
of dealing with this problem.
She's not getting off that easy.
Well, I hate to say it,
but her cold feet have put yours to the fire.
What are your options?
I have a plan.
And what's that?
Proving that blood...
is the most powerful thing of all.
Shouldn't you be getting ready?
To do what exactly, my dear?
Finally go down for the David Clarke frame-up?
Yeah, this list worked its way free from your bag
while you were busy faking affection for me.
It's not what you think.
I think I've been played a fool by you and your wiles.
It's obviously my greatest weakness.
You're the beneficiary of Ms. LeMarchal's patronage,
are you not?
I was.
But I-I...
I told her I wouldn't work with her anymore.
Well, nonetheless, this house has hit its quotient
for vindictive harpies.
You're more than welcome to resume slinging drinks
at whatever backwater berg will have you.
Please, Conrad.
I admit that when I returned, I wanted payback,
but I just couldn't go through with it.
Get out.
需要马上聊聊
I gather from the tenor of your text
that all is not well this morning?
Victoria isn't attending the wedding.
Why is it the women in my life
never cease to surprise and disappoint?
I know that she and I have had our differences,
but to miss her son's wedding?
Well, you and your union have my full support, Emily.
Good...
because I already have no family.
And I'm sure their absence is amplified
on a day such as this.
So please don't think me presumptuous
when I hope that you might find me as...
adequate recompense.
I do, Conrad.
And I know my father would share my feelings for you
if he was still alive.
And perhaps he would've had some...
fresh insight on how to deal with Victoria.
But sadly, you are stuck with a man who has very little sway
over his wife.
Then I guess this will be...
the first of many things that Victoria misses.
The birth, the christening...
her grandchild's whole life.
If only Patrick hadn't left.
Why?
Because he reminded her of the pain her absence can cause.
Maybe his presence would've changed her mind.
I guess he's gone.
So Victoria's attendance means that much to you?
I just want this day to be perfect,
from start to finish.
Here.
Shouldn't you be getting ready?
Tux takes 10 minutes to get on,
12 depending on the cufflinks.
Since our future's riding on this issue,
I figured I'd pop by.
Go. You're making us all nervous.
Heard you were here.
I was--
Giving an interview for the article on your cake.
I know. How'd it go?
Good.
Said nice things about you. I think I even meant them.
It'd be much easier if you hated me right now.
And I would
if I hadn't just booked two more gigs.
Guess your master plan worked, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I want you to know--
Enough, Danny.
I know you're used to getting your way,
But you can't make everything okay for everyone.
Life doesn't work like that, even for you.
Congrats again.
Of course, Carrie.
We have a 3:00 tea time,
which will allow for cocktails at sunset.
I'll see you then.
Mom?
Oh! Patrick!
Oh, my god!
Are you okay? What are you doing here?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Are you?
While you were sly to exile him to the nearest island,
did you not think I'd come to know he was in Manhattan?
You stay away from my son.
I was hoping to use dear Patrick as incentive
to change your mind about attending Daniel's wedding.
I can't imagine why you would care.
Oh, wait. Let me guess-- Emily put you up to it.
Well, she and I both agreed
that your absence shouldn't become today's focus.
So I'm going to quash my understandable resistance
to embrace one son of yours
if you're willing to muster the love to support the other.
If you think I'm going to be blackmailed
by a collusion with that--
They're right, Mom.
You worked so hard to repair our relationship.
I wanted to do the same for Daniel.
And that's why I came when Conrad reached out.
When Conrad reaches out,
beware of what's in his hand.
I approach with open palm, Victoria,
hoping to leave our grievances in the past.
If anything should happen to Patrick,
understand this, Conrad--
they will be wiping what's left of you up with a sponge.
I'll have a tuxedo sent...
Assuming we have a deal that you will attend
all wedding-related festivities.
Say "Yes," Mom.
For the family.
Your family.
Okay, let's go over this one last time.
Before you board the Grayson yacht,
I'm gonna sneak on side
and preset the gun we bought in Victoria's name.
Then I will hide out and wait until exactly 10 past 9:00,
when you should be approaching the buoy.
At which point,
you will premiere the Grayson family slide show,
which I nauseatingly prepared.
When everyone's watching,
I'll make sure Victoria leaves.
Then I'll make sure she's trapped,
then await the sound of gunshots.
And I'll only fire once I've poured my blood on deck
as evidence that she shot me.
Once you've jumped overboard,
I'll release Victoria's door, ensuring her lack of alibi.
Now you have exactly 20 minutes
until the coast guard starts the search.
Retrieve the case from the buoy,
use the mini scuba tank to get beneath the surface,
catch the current, and meet me at the beach.
Then finally, with means, motive,
gunshot residue on her bracelet, and no alibi,
Victoria Grayson will be under arrest for my murder.
And under questioning, I guarantee
that she'll roll on Conrad in an attempt to save herself.
Let's take down the Graysons once and for all.
You came to say good-bye?
Since you're not coming to the wedding... yeah, Jack, I am.
Look, I'm, uh...
I'm sure you got a million things to do,
and I'm not much for good-byes, so...
Jack...
There's one more thing I wanted to tell you before I go.
About Amanda.
I was with her when she died.
What?
I was able to get you off the boat.
But by the time I made it back...
I couldn't save her.
I held her in my arms, Jack.
And the last thing that she made me promise
was that I would take care of you and Carl.
And you're just now saying this?
Why wait till now?
I know it's because you were
just too busy protecting your plan.
Which I changed because you asked me to,
because there was a time, Jack, when you were my best friend.
But look at what you've become
and who you're turning me into.
You are so selfish.
You use everyone who cares about you.
I lost Amanda, too.
You've taken everything from me!
Even this moment.
This good-bye.
I know Amanda deserved better from me.
I just hope that one day,
you can understand why I needed to do this.
Good-bye, Jack.
You did well playing contrite for Conrad.
Well, I meant what I said,
about bringing the family back together.
I know you did.
Thank you.
But the idea of you apologizing to that man is nauseating.
Well, it got me through the door, right?
I'm so glad you're here.
I think you're the only person who'll get me through today.
Okay.
Of course, I--
I wonder what that tarantula has up his many sleeves.
We have to be ready to strike first.
I can't go down that road again.
Nor would I want you to.
We'll find more creative ways of dealing with Conrad.
I don't think I could ever bear the thought of losing you again.
You have nothing to worry about, mom.
News travels fast.
I got your text.
Um, actually got all 40 of 'em
over the past month.
With a zero percent response rate.
You really know how to make a guy feel special.
Patrick, I spent a lot of time
wondering what the hell happened.
I...
About disappearing-- Nolan, I'm sorry.
There were reasons it was time for me to leave the Hamptons.
It's a good thing that I, uh...
like reunions.
Nolan, I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
And I-I-I know I'm the one that said
we shouldn't care what other people think,
but things have changed.
My mom really needs me right now, so I...
Yeah, but I'm not...
asking you to make a choice.
Look, go to the wedding with her.
Spend the after party with me.
Sorry.
It's for the best.
I know. Bugging the bride on her wedding day--bad form.
But I thought we should talk.
I honestly don't have time for this right now.
Oh, funny that you should say that,
because there's nothing honest about you,
and I can finally prove it.
Here's the "After."
clearly not you.
Ready for the "Before"?
And there you are, Emily.
Looks just like you,
but with a billion fewer dollars.
What do you want, Lydia?
For starters, I want my house back.
It helped being next door to land a Grayson,
didn't it?
It's yours.
Just please,
don't ruin my wedding day.
Leave the door unlocked.
It'll make it easier for me to move back in.
Mm. I'm sure that smile would be genuine
if Lydia was draped over your arm.
I heard about your slumber party last night.
Oh, that was a momentary lapse of reason--
not unlike our last approach to the altar.
Mrs. Grayson, how does it feel
adding a new member to your family?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Patrick is a gentleman
and the light of my life.
I think he meant Emily.
Is your son excited? Is your son excited?
Of course he did.
I've always put faith in my son Daniel's heart.
And today, we shall see where it lies.
Charlotte, you look beautiful.
Me?
You're already glowing.
I can't believe I'm gonna be an aunt again.
I'm sure it'll be a little girl.
And just think, she and Carl will grow up together,
play on the beach.
I'm sure they'll be best friends.
Sounds wonderful.
I'm gonna go check and make sure my folks are here
and give you some time alone.
Charlotte...
I love you.
I love you, too,
my almost sister.
You look beautiful.
Though I imagine my admiring gaze isn't why you summoned me.
Lydia has evidence that could ruin me.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
Just getting to see you so lovely is...
it's worth the risk of being here.
Rohan did an exemplary job,
though it's likely a wasted effort
as there should be no reason to activate this emergency beacon.
May I?
After our rocket start,
who would thought we'd end up here?
Truthfully, I did.
Hoped, at least.
Only you
could make vengeance so beautiful.
Stay back.
Let's do it.
...the social event of the season.
We are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage
of Emily Rebecca Thorne
and Daniel Edward Grayson.
If anyone has reason to object to their blessed union,
please speak now or forever hold your peace.
I don't recall
seeing your name on the guest list.
Who the hell are you?
A friend of the bride
who's been authorized to initiate the transfer
of the beach cottage's ownership--
a deal that we can start now and finalize tomorrow,
or...
it goes away if you go anywhere near that church.
With this ring, I commit to you,
to our child,
and our future together.
I love you, Emily,
now and always.
Daniel...
I've looked forward to this day since I was a little girl.
Thank you for letting me into your life,
into your family.
Daddy!
Through you,
I have become the woman that I've always wanted to be.
The woman that I needed to be.
From the moment I met you,
I knew that this moment was in our destiny.
We share a bond that is unbreakable...
until death parts us.
By the powers vested in me by god
and the state of New York,
I pronounce you man and wife.
You may now kiss your bride.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor to present to you
Daniel and Emily Grayson.
You've been quiet ever since we left the church.
I'm sorry.
It's our big day, and here I am, stressing about work.
Is that why you're drinking for the both of us?
Well, my dad opened... a 64-year-old bottle of glenlivet.
Grayson groom tradition.
Well, maybe you should slow down a bit.
We still have a boat ride to Nantucket ahead.
You, uh, have her for a lifetime.
You mind if I borrow her for 16 eight counts?
Well, she's all yours.
I hate to say it.
You two do make a beautiful couple.
And it's such a shame
the bride only has a few hours to live.
Did you handle the Patrick situation?
He shut me down,
in favor of staying glued to mommy drearest's side.
Which is exactly why he can't get on that yacht.
He won't.
Trust me.
I do,
with my life.
So...
I guess this is it.
Long live David Clarke.
No, we need more intimate shots.
I want the readers to feel like they were here. Okay?
Sure.
Hands-on, right down to the last detail.
Such dedication for an editor.
And a beat reporter, too, I hear?
Chasing specious conspiracy theories.
Don't make an enemy of me, Ms. LeMarchal
Or what?
You'll destroy me like you destroyed so many others?
Oh, no, you see, such flagrant inaccuracies of my character.
But then, your source is a...
disgruntled ex-mistress with a history of head trauma.
Yet, you are so concerned.
Ah, rest assured, Lydia is no threat.
One romantic rendez-vous with you
and she was useless to me.
Is that so?
Her allegiance is clear.
As twisted as it seems, she loves you.
This is Sara. Leave a message.
It's me.
Maybe we... we...
Daniel?
You okay?
House manager in Nantucket needed to...
confirm a surprise I'm planning for em.
Well, it's time to cut the cake.
Let's cut the cake.
Father/daughter shot.
Thank you. Gorgeous.
Daniel hasn't uttered a word to me all day.
Well, give him some time.
At least he looks happy.
Emily's been kind.
Well, that's how I know she's up to something.
A word of advice--
be the perfect in-law, perfect grandmother.
And then when your suspicions are proven true...
don't say "I told you so."
我知道保罗神父的真面目
Is everything okay?
Excuse me.
Sara made a beautiful cake.
You don't have to say that.
I understand what it is to want closure.
I know you do things you never thought you would do.
I swear,
I'm gonna be a better man to you,
and an even better dad to our baby.
Excuse me.
Have you come to kick me out of this suite, too?
I have not.
Then what, Conrad?
Lydia, I am a titan of industry,
master of the damned universe.
I have the right family,
the right connections,
and the wrong woman by my side.
I planned to remedy that
when I fell in love with you years ago--
a feeling that was recently reignited...
and promptly... extinguished when I found your journal.
Conrad, I...
Shh. Let me finish.
I've always had a weakness for you
because you're the only woman to see the guilt and the pain,
the...
the good... and the bad.
I'm not a simple man to be with,
but I have a simple question.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Then I want you to have the life I promised years ago,
with me.
And maybe it's time we shake things up in the Hamptons.
Let's.
Emily told me
you almost didn't attend the ceremony.
What changed your mind?
Love for my son.
Well, I assume you mean Patrick.
Your brother's presence made this day bearable,
but I came because I wanted to salvage our relationship,
for everyone's sake.
Well, that's easy.
You can... accept Emily, accept that we're having a baby,
and we're happy.
Yet, you're obviously self-medicating.
Daniel, you don't look happy.
You look trapped.
Where's Patrick?
I hope he'll be joining us on the yacht.
He went to the city to pick up a few things.
But he'll be arriving in Nantucket tomorrow.
Good.
I do want this to be
a weekend the whole family can remember.
Okay, last looks for hair and makeup.
We have a few shots here at the house
and several more combinations as you board.
Sorry I'm a bit late,
But, um...
Well, I guess now's the time to tell you all that
I've invited someone to join us on our family sojourn.
And my guest has flawless skin.
No touch-up needed.
Conrad.
Lydia and I don't exactly get along.
Oh. Well, it may be your honeymoon, sweetheart,
but it's still my yacht.
And mine.
Vacationing with your harlot is where I draw the line.
Need I remind you of our deal, Victoria?
If you want me to welcome Patrick back into the fold,
you'll do the same for my companion.
You duplicitous--
Victoria.
Don't give him the satisfaction.
My associate said we had a deal.
Right. The beach house.
What more do you want, Lydia?
I want you to get exactly what's coming to you.
All eyes were on the Hamptons today
for the most anticipated wedding of the year,
as socialite Emily Thorne
and budding media mogul Daniel Grayson...
wed in a ceremony on...
Don't worry, boss.
I'm off the clock and a paying customer.
They've been playing
this "Happily ever after" crap on loop.
What about the cake? That's the real story.
Well, this must be some great P.R. for you.
That's gotta be a reason to celebrate.
It's not that kinda night.
It's the kinda night you get wasted and think about
how you fell in love with your ex-boyfriend
weeks before his wedding,
and how you keep replaying his stupid voice mail he left
at his frickin' wedding reception.
Daniel?
Yeah.
And he let me think there was a chance.
I saw Danny this morning.
He didn't ask me, but...
I know he wanted me to forgive him.
I didn't because...
once I do--
It's over for good.
Dumb as hell, right?
Come on.
You're not gonna tell a stupid girl
she's being stupid?
Well, you know, that kind of attitude
just might get you laid tonight, Mr. Porter.
How about I call you a cab?
Thought my text would get your attention.
What do you think you know?
When I heard about the sabotage to Conrad's brakes,
I did what I've been doing since I was 14 months old--
put two and two together.
I know it was you that caused the crash.
What is this? A threat?
No.
I've known about this for weeks.
I haven't told a soul.
The only reason that I brought up what you did
was to bring you back.
Patrick...
You're safe,
in a way that you never were at Grayson Manor.
You know, Victoria told me about
how Conrad kept her prisoner in that marriage for years.
That man killed her spirit.
He did just a little bit, you know, every day.
So I did something that I regret like hell.
I'm sure you can't possibly understand that.
I fight for the people that I love, too.
That's why you're here...
right now.
I can't just let that go.
Can I get everyone's attention, please?
I know that many of you thought a family honeymoon
was... odd, to say the least.
But...
I want this marriage
to be about family--
past, present,
and future.
I've been keeping a little secret from you all,
even Daniel.
I put together a video of
some of our Grayson celebrations over the past couple of years.
I wanted to screen it for you all now.
Don't worry. It's cider.
To ties that bind us.
Cheers.
To family.
Cheers.
To family.
Cheers.
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!
I'll take care of it in the stateroom.
Hello?
What are you talking about?
Daniel?
That was Sara's roommate.
Daniel, what is it?
Sara tried to kill herself.
I am so sorry.
Don't. Don't.
Victoria, wait.
Have you come to help?
Mm. Well, I didn't even think to ask if you had club soda
for this spill, since most bartenders do.
I'm done making mai tais.
Conrad's promised me a penthouse.
If you're referring to that sad little pied-à-terre
where he entertains his mistresses,
I'd wash the sheets first.
You don't love him, Victoria,
so I don't know what you're going on about.
Besides, we both know you have far bigger concerns than me.
And they say no one ever thinks about the mother of the groom.
I thought I'd bring you a real drink,
since I suspect you're about as pregnant as I am.
This photo proves that
you've been targeting my family and my son for years.
Now who are you?
As of five hours ago,
I'm Emily Grayson.
You're trying to bait me.
You'd like nothing more than for me to grab you by the throat
so that you can say that I'm crazy.
You know, for once,
you're not completely mad, Victoria.
Daniel needed a little last-minute incentive,
so I stole from the master manipulator.
After all, isn't a fake pregnancy how you landed Conrad?
Well, the difference is that I believed I loved him.
But you're nothing but a predator.
An empty shell who seeks to wreak havoc.
That's it.
Do you even hear yourself, Victoria?
What a sad, sad woman.
To care about what you think, Emily,
I would have to feel something for you.
You are as worthless to me
as this bracelet.
Go on.
Go after it,
before the other bottom-feeders beat you to it.
Good-bye, Victoria.
Two minutes and then fire.
I heard everything.
Daniel.
What, you gonna shoot me?
No.
You set me up.
Two years!
Two years,
and I bet you laughed at me every time I questioned you.
And you just fed me more of your lies.
And why?!
Why did you tell me I was gonna be a father?!
I'm sorry.
Captain, man overboard!
All hands on deck!
Bring her about!
Off the starboard!
All right! Starboard engine full throttle!
What the devil happened?
Oh, my god.
Where's Emily?
Where's Victoria?
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna shower.
Why don't you
put on some music and, uh, come join me?
Okay.
I mean, dude.
You ever hear of a universal remote?
What are you doing here?
Don't worry.
I just wanna end things right with her.
Emily left this for me, but I think she should have it.
It was Amanda's.
She's not here?
What do you mean?
She should have beat me to the beach ten minutes ago.
The distress beacon has not been activated.
Then where the hell is she?
Oh, god.
Emily?
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
Emily!
