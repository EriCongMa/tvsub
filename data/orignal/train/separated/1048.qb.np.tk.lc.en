any leads on who killed ellen ?
no , not who killed her .
sam ?
not even a last name .
but there &apos;s this .
an e @-@ mail account not linked to anything else
the marshals found at ellen &apos;s apartment .
when i run one of mozzie &apos;s tracking programs ,
i get this .
somebody &apos;s still checking it , regularly ,
at internet cafes around d.c.
you think it &apos;s sam .
ellen told me to trust him ,
that he &apos;s my best chance for answers .
but if it is sam ...
what do i say ?
you tell him you want to meet on neutral ground .
&quot; we &apos;ll meet on your terms . &quot;
no , you can &apos;t let sam control the meet .
neal ! neal ! let me in !
neal !
someone &apos;s trying to kill me .
what ? ! why am i not surprised ?
no time for sarcasm , suit .
calm down , okay ? you &apos;re all right now .
i almost ate a bullet . i &apos;ve been on that ride before .
it shakes you up . i can &apos;t calm down .
mozzie , breathe .
take a seat ...
and tell us what happened .
okay .
it all started when june and i paid our weekly visit
to the market of lost treasures .
hester &apos;s storage sells the best abandoned units .
okay , we got a 5&apos;x10 &apos; here . get a good look .
at a storage auction ,
you only have a few moments to gauge the unit &apos;s worth .
people see &quot; fragile , &quot; and they think &quot; valuable . &quot;
but an arrow pointing in the wrong direction .
reeks of foreclosure trash .
ooh , look at that toy .
that is an antique lionel crane .
john @-@ john had one down at the cape .
okay , time &apos;s up .
we &apos;re gonna start the auction .
give me $ 25 .
now , $ 25 right here . looking for $ 50 .
$ 50 . i got $ 50 right here . looking for $ 100 .
$ 200 , $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 . that &apos;s $ 600 right here .
looking for $ 700 .
$ 700 going once . $ 700 going twice .
it &apos;s sold , right here at $ 700 to the gentleman .
you used june as a plant
to up the price of worthless units .
well , it helps drain their resources
so i &apos;m flush when a valuable unit comes up .
and june was okay with that ?
most likely , it was her idea .
all right . what happened ?
june was crushing it ,
but i still hadn &apos;t seen a desirable unit , until ...
corner unit . get a look .
okay . let &apos;s start the bidding .
we &apos;re gonna start the bidding at $ 25 .
anybody give me $ 25 right here , looking ar $ 50 .
$ 25 .
$ 50 , anybody ? $ 50 right here . looking at $ 75 .
$ 100 !
$ 100 right here . $ 200 . $ 300 , looking for $ 400 .
$ 400 !
$ 400 , looking for $ 500 . $ 600 , looking for $ 700 .
$ 800 !
looking at $ 800 . $ 850 , for $ 900 .
$ 900 .
$ 975 ?
$ 925 ? $ 900 going once .
what &apos;s the matter -- low on funds ? - $ 900 going twice .
till next week , mini @-@ me .
sold , right here at $ 900 to mr. dapper .
let &apos;s take a look at the next unit . follow me .
oh , these old cameras are great .
they don &apos;t have the prism that flips the image --
a natural gravity defier , if you will .
oh , moz .
of all the units ... why this one ?
it &apos;s a cache of chaos .
pinhole cameras .
maybe find some daguerreotypes ,
some forgotten vivian maier photographs .
whoever this guy is , he was definitely onto something .
or on something .
i &apos;ll leave this to you .
thanks , june .
i &apos;d stumbled onto something interesting .
the flotsam of an unusual mind ? eh , perhaps .
but whoever this , uh , c.h. is ,
he &apos;d certainly given me my money &apos;s worth .
of the two keys i found -- one modern , one antique --
the modern key opened the obvious door .
anyone home ?
you walked into the house ?
i &apos;d bought it , didn &apos;t i ?
no . you didn &apos;t .
seriously , suit ? what would you have done in my situation ?
i would never be in your situation .
get to the part about the gun .
fine .
naturally , i made myself at home .
you started cleaning ?
well , a layer of dust would do my sinuses no good ,
and it led to a fortuitous discovery .
you found yourself a secret passage ?
in the library , behind a bookcase !
and it gets even better .
you &apos;re a nightmarish goldilocks .
minus the golden curls . keep going .
well , i spent a few days settling in .
now , i &apos;ve lived by myself long enough
to know when i &apos;m not alone .
he wore all black , and -- and he was tall --
like &quot; ichabod crane &quot; tall .
where &apos;s the flag , 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ?
he called you 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ?
and he wanted a flag ?
i had no clue what he was talking about , either .
well , that makes all of us .
so i had to think fast .
the flag .
of course . i was expecting you .
take me to it now .
i have a set of rules specific to this situation .
sure .
establish eye contact ... follow me .
... force him to acknowledge my humanity ...
slowly . no sudden moves .
... then run like hell !
you are dead , 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 !
taxi !
so , i popped out on the street ,
hailed a cab , and came right here .
so , all this is a case of mistaken identity ?
yeah . he thinks i &apos;m someone named 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 .
and that you &apos;ve got a flag .
no , no . not just a flag .
a flag he &apos;s willing to kill for .
nypd did a search of mozzie &apos;s new house .
they found an open window ,
empty liquor bottles , and a slept @-@ in bed .
how about the secret passage behind the bookshelf ?
that , they also found , along with a broken vase .
so mozzie &apos;s not entirely crazy .
they &apos;re calling it a tall tale of an illegal squatter , which --
isn &apos;t entirely untrue .
except for the &quot; tall &quot; part .
what do you have , jones ?
dead @-@ end city .
our storage unit is registered to a p.o. box
owned by someone whose signature is totally unreadable .
and whoever they are ,
they stopped paying cash two months ago ,
so the facility sent the required late notices
and auctioned it off to your guy , mozzie .
what about the house ?
well , it &apos;s owned outright by a robert townsend , since 1781 .
yeah , he &apos;s real dead .
a family trust was set up early last century to maintain it .
the last executor died years ago ,
but the trust keeps up the payments .
we could get more on the trust
with a federal grand jury subpoena .
this isn &apos;t a federal crime ,
and you &apos;re fresh out of the bureau doghouse .
all right . anything on the initials &quot; c.h. &quot;
that mozzie found on the robe ?
nada .
nothing .
anything on who or what the name 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 might be ?
nope .
zilch .
maybe i can track the family lineage
without using fbi resources .
guys , i &apos;m sorry , but i have to
get my land @-@ fraud case to the a.u.s.a. by noon .
neal , could you -- - help diana research the family .
mind reader .
we found more on robert townsend .
he was part of the culper spy ring .
主要领导人是撒母耳 · 卡柏
if i recall from history class ,
george washington created the culper spies
to aid the continental army during the revolutionary war .
please tell me you &apos;re not talking about those culper spies .
yes , i am . they sent intel
from british @-@ occupied new york using codes .
and they used numbers , not names .
don &apos;t tell me . 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 was robert townsend ?
you got it .
why would the gunman call mozzie
a code name of a dead revolutionary war spy ?
this book presents a possible theory .
it caused some controversy
when it was published six months ago .
it claims culper descendants
have been keeping the spy ring active since the war .
by using their ancestor &apos;s numbers ?
yep . listen to this .
&quot; culper descendants
are a secretly sanctioned government organization ,
empowered by blood to keep the united states safe .
their name may have faded ,
but their loyalty is alive and well . &quot;
that &apos;s insane .
the culpers disbanded after the revolutionary war .
only a conspiracy nut would think that these guys ...
look who we &apos;re talking about .
yeah . he &apos;s gonna love this .
he is .
of course culper descendants kept the spy ring alive .
how did i miss this ?
because they didn &apos;t and you didn &apos;t .
it makes perfect sense .
this book was published , exposing them , drawing them out .
it even has their secret communication codes !
mozzie , this author of this book lost his tenured professorship
because it &apos;s filled with b.s.
read the reviews -- &quot; rampant speculation . &quot;
speculation ?
our government has endorsed
a cornucopia of questionable programs --
stargate , mk @-@ ultra , the space shuttle .
he has a point .
why are you indulging him ?
if the culpers don &apos;t exist today ,
then why is someone trying to kill 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ?
and where is 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ?
he &apos;s right , peter .
whatever you think about this ,
we could be dealing with a missing person .
that &apos;s ... possible .
7 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 , 2 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 , 6 @-@ 6 @-@ 9 , 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ...
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s the journal i found at the storage unit .
i &apos;m reading the code . t @-@ these numbers mean words .
&quot; washington hand unto 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 the country clothier
he carried through the ice unto new jersey in december . &quot;
what ? !
washington gave a flag to the culpers .
the very flag he carried across the delaware in 1776 .
what do you think of that , suit ?
that flag would be worth a fortune today .
an authentic symbol of our burgeoning &quot; freedom &quot; as a country ?
on a rough estimate , i would say priceless .
peter , mozzie has stumbled across clues
that could lead us to a lost american treasure .
indeed !
this is a modern day 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 &apos;s coded journal .
and he &apos;s talking to a 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 about the flag .
3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 ?
oh , the culpers &apos; female spy .
it looks as if our lady culper has some letters
containing important information pertaining
to the location of the flag .
we should reach out to her .
how do you make contact with the mysterious ancestor
of a 250 @-@ year @-@ old woman ?
well , the way the culpers originally communicated --
through strategically placed messages in newspapers .
洗衣店
so , this is what a secret spy message looks like .
according to the journal mozzie found ,
7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 requested this lady culper
check this paper every morning for a code .
so mozzie placed his own ad .
well , that &apos;s only a little bit crazy .
what does it mean ?
well , during the war ,
the culpers had to travel the long island sound
from british to american territory .
sounds dangerous .
it was .
so , what they did is they hid codes
on a clothesline by the shore to communicate .
gives new meaning to &quot; dirty laundry . &quot;
so , mozzie &apos;s using the old clothesline code .
that &apos;s kind of cute .
no , don &apos;t encourage .
but undergarments symbolize the person you want to contact .
and then the handkerchiefs were where they were supposed to be .
so the petticoat is the female spy mozzie wants to meet .
yes , the female spy descendant .
now , he wants to meet at 9 : 00 a.m.
where ?
well , back in the day , four handkerchiefs
referred to an old pub on 16th and 2nd avenue .
well , that &apos;s stuyvesant park now .
yeah , so we &apos;re going to stuyvesant park .
that &apos;s them , about to ruin a perfectly good saturday .
well , honey , you get to go on a treasure hunt .
you love treasure hunts .
i &apos;m only going on the off @-@ chance
that the gunman sees this ad and shows up .
morning , peter .
neal .
suit .
haversham .
got everything we need for a day of intrigue .
mrs. suit , it &apos;s been way too long !
oh , it has , and i see you &apos;ve fallen
back into the routine of torturing my husband .
old habits .
the suit will see it my way .
&quot; time makes more converts than reason . &quot;
thomas paine &apos;s &quot; common sense . &quot;
you &apos;re the last person who should be quoting &quot; common sense . &quot;
mozzie , do you really think you &apos;re gonna swap intel
with a spy in the east village ?
indeed .
you know , i once entertained the idea
that my birth parents were spies .
there &apos;s no chance you &apos;ll ignore that , right ?
have fun .
no one &apos;s recognized me yet .
keep your eye out for ichabod crane .
i &apos;m completely exposed out here .
neal , i &apos;m using an outdated cia spy kit
that , according to mozzie ,
he once hoped belonged to his parents .
tell me why you &apos;re encouraging this
before i get sent back to evidence .
i don &apos;t think you want to know .
you &apos;ll get all tense , and you &apos;ll make that grimace , and ...
there . it &apos;s like i &apos;m getting a massage .
talk .
now i &apos;m tense .
oh , that does help .
talk .
okay . you know mozzie is an orphan .
yeah
well , an orphan &apos;s gonna wonder about his parents .
so , he imagined they were spies .
mozzie &apos;s first conspiracy theory and his coping mechanism .
occasionally , something happens
that triggers mozzie to revisit his childhood .
he falls into a spy cycle ?
do not mention valerie plame in his presence .
so , if this female culper descendant actually shows up ,
he might spiral back to his childhood delusions ?
when ellen told me my dad was corrupt --
you ran from the truth .
yeah , and became a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
mozzie tells himself these stories
to maintain his faith in the world .
but not in the government .
his faith , however limited , is all that separates
a man with a conscience from a man without one .
i knew i was right .
so much for a delusion .
agent 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 ?
agent 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 .
no names . perfect .
actual spies don &apos;t greet each other by code .
they do in airport novels .
i was busy working on the flag .
i thought that stupid culper descendant book
might &apos;ve caused you to go dark .
you know the press actually contacted me to verify it ?
it &apos;s frustrating that our existence came into question .
as if there &apos;s even a question .
so , do you have the letters ?
i do . i &apos;m still concerned about their preservation .
preservation ? o @-@ of course .
i can assure you they will be ... preserved .
i know i keep harping on it . it &apos;s the librarian in me .
commendable profession , 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 .
call me tempest .
no need to pretend about the culper code with me .
that &apos;s a mark against mozzie &apos;s theory .
what &apos;s your name ?
oh , he &apos;ll find a way to ignore it .
you can just call me 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 .
i take the culper code very seriously .
i love how invested you are in our ancestry .
family history is very important .
yes , it &apos;s , uh , vital to know who we come from .
i take it you found the infirmary ?
the infirmary ? y--
of course . i ... found the infirmary .
the -- the infirmary .
yes , o @-@ of course .
the flag , the letters , the infirmary --
are they making it up as they go along ?
the infirmary . why do i know that ?
where is it ?
uh , all in good time .
we made a deal -- the letters for the infirmary .
the storage unit used to be an infirmary .
i wonder why that &apos;s so important .
well , hopefully , we &apos;ll find out .
if you won &apos;t hold up your end ,
i &apos;ll be going .
uh , t @-@ the infirmary is downtown .
i @-@ it &apos;s now a facility known as hester &apos;s storage .
these letters have been in my family for generations .
please be careful when you test them .
this has been a pleasure , 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 .
recognize someone ?
yeah
all right . intercept mozzie . get him out of here .
i &apos;m gonna have a chat with our friend .
fbi ! put down your weapon !
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ve been mugged twice .
i &apos;d like to see a badge .
put your gun on the ground now .
right .
how about the badge ?
all right . my apologies .
i reached for my wallet , you reached for the gun .
my instinct kicked in , all right ?
you have a permit for this ?
i &apos;d be drawn and quartered if i didn &apos;t .
go ahead .
you match the physical description of an assault suspect .
i &apos;m gonna need you to come in , answer a few questions .
you were just at stuyvesant park on a whim ?
no , i read an ad in today &apos;s newspaper .
i thought i &apos;d be able to interview
some culper spy descendants .
well , why would you want to interview the culper spies
after you &apos;ve already written a book about them ?
you writing a second book ?
yes , some asinine critics seem to
have missed the vision of my first .
and you aim to prove them wrong ?
once i definitively prove that the culpers remain active ,
i will be lecturing at harvard with tenure .
what &apos;s your connection to the culpers ?
i have none .
the closest i come to the revolution
is my penchant for tea .
you simply want to be the first person
to prove that they still exist ?
with psychoanalytic skills like that ,
you should be in the profiling department .
tell you what else i see -- a disgraced egomaniac
who &apos;s playing an unorthodox game of &quot; capture the flag . &quot;
i am looking for the flag . so are a lot of other people .
it is not a crime .
no , but attacking the man known as 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 in his home is .
and i do hope that you are able to capture
whomever is responsible for that .
i think i have .
finding that flag , by any means necessary --
that would go a long way to restoring your reputation .
i &apos;m an academic .
do you really think i would stoop to such measures ?
you were pretty quick with that gun .
i was mugged ! y--
well , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s there in the report .
now , if you can &apos;t charge me with anything ,
i &apos;m going to leave .
what , you can &apos;t hold stringer on anything ?
except he tried to kill me !
we have a circumstantial witness report ,
and his gun permit cleared ,
despite his itchy trigger finger .
is diana still putting leaves on the townsend family tree ?
i &apos;m about to talk to her . the letters reveal anything ?
not yet .
but mozzie &apos;s mixing chemicals right now
to test for something called &quot; a sympathetic stain . &quot;
ah , the invisible ink washington used
to pass messages to the culpers .
of course that would make an appearance .
you really know your culper history .
i &apos;ve been catching up .
washington was quite an innovator .
for a guy who never told a lie ,
he certainly stretched the truth a lot .
it is the mark of a great politician .
i &apos;m ready .
all right . mozzie &apos;s ready .
i &apos;ll let you know if we find anything .
all right .
you think tempest has kids ?
must be hard to raise kids as a spy .
nearly impossible , i &apos;d imagine .
so , we got everything we need to read between the lines ?
you know , there are those who say that the coining of that phrase
is washington &apos;s greatest achievement .
here . light that up .
okay . now , be careful .
&quot; the secret is in your eyes . &quot;
i think i know what that means .
find anything ?
i started with the family history of robert townsend ,
the man they think is mozzie &apos;s ancestor .
and ?
his lineage ends with his son ,
and little is known about his family after he died in 1838 .
but guess who &apos;s the mother of his son .
you got me .
agent 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 .
the ancestor of our librarian .
that got me thinking .
what if i track her ancestry or other culper spies ?
i might figure out who 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 is today .
i found a bunch of them nearby .
who are they ?
one &apos;s a marketing director in connecticut ,
there &apos;s a nurse in spanish harlem ,
and a rutgers professor .
a professor ?
i interviewed a former professor about this --
oliver stringer .
no connection . could be a coincidence .
unless it &apos;s not . who &apos;s your guy ?
nathan woodhull .
well , we won &apos;t be interviewing him anytime soon .
he was strangled in his home two months ago .
is your professor stringer a suspect ?
no , but the guy they arrested
has initials that are particularly interesting .
&quot; cabot hawkins . &quot;
&quot; c.h. &quot; -- the initials on mozzie &apos;s bathrobe .
look where they &apos;re keeping him .
&quot; the secret is in her eyes &quot; made me realize
what these holes you told me about might be for .
the room is a camera obscura !
these used to be windows .
so , you black out most of the light in the room
except for one spot on the glass ,
and the light naturally projects .
it &apos;s an upside @-@ down image .
the view outside over the woman &apos;s eye !
yeah .
it flips the image like a pinhole camera .
so that &apos;s where the flag is ?
well , not necessarily .
i mean , there are dozens of holes here .
oh , and each hole presents a different location over her eye .
modern @-@ day 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 drilled these holes
to try to figure out which projection is correct .
he was re @-@ creating the infirmary .
his ancestor would lay on this bed ,
looking up at 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 &apos;s eye .
the flag could be any one of these .
so , the coordinates to the right hole
are the final key .
if we get those , then we &apos;ll find the location of the flag .
hey , peter .
can you and mozzie meet me at my house ?
i &apos;ve got an update on the case .
all right .
i paid a visit to bellevue today .
meet psych patient cabot hawkins ,
otherwise known as agent 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 .
cops found cabot hawkins at a murder scene
of another culper spy descendant --
number 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 .
that victim could have been me !
judge ruled cabot be taken to an insane asylum ,
and his records were sealed .
were you able to question him ?
at first , he wouldn &apos;t talk to me .
he said he would only talk to 7 @-@ 1 @-@ 1,
but i got to him eventually .
7 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 ? that &apos;s george washington !
how &apos;d you get to him
if he &apos;d only talk to washington &apos;s descendants ?
i may have quoted our founding father .
you tricked him into thinking that washington was your ancestor ?
i gently guided him .
cabot claims that he was only there to get the guy &apos;s documents ,
but when he arrived , the man was already dead .
do you believe him ?
he also told me that his cat gave him a parasite
that subtly manipulates his personality .
sounds like paranoia runs in the townsend blood .
yeah .
cabot also said that he alone
tracked down the descendants &apos; clues about the flag .
with no help from anybody ?
all by himself ?
so there &apos;s no culper network .
i &apos;m sorry , moz .
well , theories are meant to be disproved .
you think , uh , stringer could be the killer ?
my gut tells me it &apos;s not cabot .
then i gave you one bad guy to put on your books .
good for you .
hey , where are you going ?
we still need you to prove stringer &apos;s guilty .
well , you &apos;re good at solving crimes .
i &apos;ll just stick to , uh ...
finding them .
you sure he &apos;s gonna be all right ?
this spy thing means more to him than he lets on .
what you got there , moz ?
oh , research -- about my parents .
this may be a surprise ,
but the culpers weren &apos;t just a treasure hunt to me .
no ?
once again , i fell under the spell
that if the culpers existed as spies --
then your parents could be spies , too .
yes .
what are these ?
i made them in third grade to impress the other kids
at the orphanage about my parents &apos; story --
secret shadow @-@ puppet show at lights out .
i might need to see that immediately .
no , it &apos;s too humiliating .
billy chadham never let me hear the end of it .
well , i &apos;m not billy chadham . show me .
it was russia , during the cold war .
alisa the noble had nobly --
remember , i wrote this when i was 8 --
devoted her life to her country .
meanwhile , across the bering strait ,
alvin the great --
i was obsessed with &quot; the chipmunks &quot; --
was also a servant to his country .
then , one fateful day , by way of the berlin crisis ,
their paths crossed .
their forbidden love , fit for shakespeare ,
resulted in the gift of a tiny son .
i was the greatest violation of the cold war .
ill luck befell them for it .
their governments , forces more evil than godzilla --
sought to divide them .
their son , in mortal danger , gave them no choice .
so they hid him with jeffries the king ,
who loved the child as his own .
and the parents were heroes ...
the child thrived ...
and one day , they reunited ...
and they all lived happily ever after .
it &apos;s a really great story .
that &apos;s all it is , neal -- just a story ...
an 8 @-@ year @-@ old tells himself
to hide the fact that his parents didn &apos;t want him .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know how hard it is to lose faith in your family .
i pored over woodhull &apos;s crime @-@ scene photos yesterday
when i finally noticed something .
the tie around his neck -- it was loosened .
so someone was trying to give him air ?
cabot was telling the truth .
he arrived after the murder and tried to help .
only thing the p.d. did get right
is that they retrieved the victim &apos;s hard drive .
found some very interesting e @-@ mails
he exchanged with stringer
about the culper descendants .
stringer used him for research .
at first , but eventually the victim gets evasive .
stringer accused him of hunting for the flag on his own .
yeah , he felt threatened .
he &apos;s a sociopath .
he thinks the flag is the key to regaining his respect .
so , stringer kills the victim
and then goes after cabot for the flag .
he doesn &apos;t know his name or what he looks like ,
so he waits at the house until someone finally shows up .
enter mozzie .
that &apos;s my working theory .
but short of having stringer confess ,
i don &apos;t know how i can prove it .
so let &apos;s get him to confess .
stringer believes the culpers still exist , right ?
let &apos;s prove they do .
my vertigo is acting up .
are you sure you can do this ?
he &apos;ll be fine . he &apos;s happy to help .
we &apos;re on , boss .
stringer must have gotten my note .
i used culper code to lure him in .
5 @-@ 6 @-@ 1 , 6 @-@ 8 @-@ 2 --
yeah , enough with the numbers .
let &apos;s get ready for our close @-@ up .
all right . good luck .
come in .
i got your note . what is this about ?
the boss wants a meeting .
the boss ?
mr. stringer .
glad you could join us .
who are you ?
we &apos;re old friends .
this is 7 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
george washington .
i cannot tell a lie .
george washington is your ancestor ?
yes .
this could go bad fast .
and what about you ?
whose descendant are you ?
thomas jefferson &apos;s .
i knew it .
the spy ring is still around .
general , i &apos;ll leave you the room .
what do you want with me ?
you &apos;ve been accosting my agents looking for the flag .
let &apos;s discuss it like gentlemen .
your network &apos;s secrecy has ruined my reputation .
why should i talk to you ?
because i can remedy that .
please . sit .
the general doesn &apos;t like guns .
i hold onto my weapon , or i &apos;m leaving .
holster it , and you can keep it .
you do know i &apos;d be more of an asset in the room with them ?
neal &apos;s enough of a live wire .
i don &apos;t need a spark plug in there , too .
this spark plug got him here , didn &apos;t he ?
let me start by saying thank you .
you &apos;ve actually done us a service
by eliminating agent 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 for us .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
yes , you do .
7 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 was a traitor within our network --
fed you information for your book
that revealed our existence .
well , sadly , he didn &apos;t feed me enough .
my book was crucified .
i can &apos;t say that upsets me .
i take it he &apos;s how you found our headquarters here ?
he showed me the correspondence with 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 about the flag .
i traced his i.p. address and found this place .
and you &apos;ve been watching it ever since .
well , i was beginning to worry that 7 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 had disappeared on me
until he showed up a couple days ago .
he hadn &apos;t disappeared .
he was detained for the murder you committed .
so that &apos;s who they got . karma .
he didn &apos;t deny it was his murder .
well , i hope your gratitude includes a gift .
i want the flag .
we don &apos;t have it .
but we &apos;d be willing to join forces in the hunt .
look , i have the coordinates .
what makes you think i need you ?
coordinates ? !
because i have the infirmary .
you should give me the infirmary .
you know this is psychological torture
making me stay in here and watch my dreams die .
then go home .
please . your part &apos;s over .
well , fine . i know when i &apos;m not appreciated .
well , you should give me the infirmary
considering i am the man who dispensed of your traitor .
well , since you &apos;re the man ,
the infirmary is now a storage space on pearl street .
well , i wish i could say this has been fun .
good luck finding the flag --
especially without 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 &apos;s family letters .
oh , withholding information . how typical .
what do you want for the letters ?
i want to know our traitor suffered .
well , he fought me for every last gasp of breath .
anything else ?
is that enough ?
it &apos;s plenty .
fbi ! put your hands in the air now !
come with me if you want to live .
what the hell ?
what the hell just happened ? !
we were wondering the same thing .
he &apos;s trying to save the coordinates .
what ? what coordinates ?
the coordinates that lead to the flag .
if we arrest stringer , he &apos;ll never give them up .
so , where are they going ?
the storage unit .
y @-@ you can lose the gun .
yeah , i &apos;ll lose the gun when i &apos;m convinced
i have all the clues , fed .
i have no idea why that lock is broken .
open the door . slowly .
agent 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 ? !
don &apos;t play me with this culper crap .
you &apos;re another fed .
no , she &apos;s a descendant of 3 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 . look .
she looks just like her .
what are you doing here ?
when he told me about the infirmary ,
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t believe it was real .
i had to see it for myself .
you touch one hair on her head ,
and you will not live to find that flag !
the coordinates are 61 centimeters by 99 .
you have three minutes to impress me .
good ?
yeah .
they must be on their way to the flag .
if they find it , mozzie &apos;s a dead man .
we don &apos;t have the coordinates .
you think mozzie left a clue ?
i know he did . it &apos;s just a matter of where .
it &apos;s locked .
i might have a key .
antique key ...
antique lock .
what &apos;s all this about ?
well , the long story short , the coordinates identify a hole
that projects the flag &apos;s location onto that woman &apos;s eye .
how &apos;d i miss that ?
now ... hold on a second .
this one &apos;s turned around .
it &apos;s the revolutionary war monument .
this monument is dedicated to the fallen soldiers
of the revolutionary war .
it was built around this stone .
&quot; 416 @-@ 209 &quot; -- &quot; never forget . &quot;
i think the flag is under here .
you know the culper code .
because you &apos;re a culper spy !
aha ! they do exist !
what ? ! i am not a spy .
hey , guys , how about we lift the stone ?
he is gonna kill us
the moment we confirm the flag is here , isn &apos;t he ?
if you see a moment , use your spy training .
i am not a spy . i don &apos;t have training .
oh , right .
&quot; culpers don &apos;t exist . &quot; copy that .
still , use your spy training .
all right . what do we got ?
well , there &apos;s a box down there .
all right . how about you go down there and get it ?
me ?
yeah .
help me up !
i hear rats down here !
you don &apos;t hear rats . you are a rat .
okay . let &apos;s see it .
it &apos;s gone .
what ? !
oh , you bastard . you conned me again !
no , that can &apos;t be ! it has to be here !
everything led to here !
you really are a spy !
run !
watch out !
fbi ! fbi ! drop your weapon !
all right .
drop it !
all right !
let &apos;s try this again , shall we ?
you &apos;re under arrest .
you okay ?
yeah . she used her spy training .
i told you -- i am not a spy .
i @-@ i saw a moment , and i took it .
hey , your secret &apos;s safe with me .
thank you .
that &apos;s a shame .
all that work , and no flag .
yeah , perhaps , but i still think it was worth it .
you &apos;re not upset ?
well , i got conclusive evidence that culper spies do exist .
and if they do , anything &apos;s possible .
tempest told you she &apos;s not a spy .
she was preserving her cover .
might i point out she was the first one to open the box ?
what does that matter ?
the flag was gone .
and so is she .
i think my work here is done .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible ...
culper descendants are running some sort of spy ring , do you ?
no . no , i ...
no .
yeah . i didn &apos;t think so .
you want to get out of here ?
sure .
