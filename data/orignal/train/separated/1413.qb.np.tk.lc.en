okay , well , alex has a cello lesson at 11 : 00 ...
and junior congress at noon .
doesn &apos;t she also have no boys at forever ?
don &apos;t you have an eating disorder you need to attend to ?
yeah , anyway , uh , we could see the 4 : 00 or the 6 : 20 .
oh , actually , that &apos;s no good .
i &apos;m meeting my friend denise for a drink .
denise ? do i know denise ?
yeah . you know , my old girlfriend .
oh , my god . gross . i can &apos;t even picture you with a woman .
thank you .
you had a girlfriend before mom ?
try two .
trust me . i had plenty of fun in my time .
and then i met your mom .
and thank you .
so i guess she travels
around selling makeup for a cosmetics company .
she &apos;s in town for a week .
you mean she &apos;s like a door @-@ to @-@ door salesman ?
if you were doing it , they &apos;d call it a dork @-@ to @-@ dork salesman .
my boy strikes like a rattlesnake !
oh , yeah ? w @-@ well , you-
wow . all right , well , we can see the movie tomorrow .
come on . it &apos;s time for your lesson .
you mean her second lesson , because she just got schooled .
what &apos;s wrong with me today ?
shake it off , champ . it &apos;s not your day .
ay , good morning , papi .
is it ?
ay , you &apos;re still sad because of that audition .
that part was mine . i was born to play tevye .
instead they give it to rod jackson ?
what does he know from suffering ?
how are we doing ?
a little better .
but we &apos;re gonna go and throw ice cream at the problem .
well , if that doesn &apos;t work , this should do the trick .
&quot; what doesn &apos;t kill us makes us stronger . &quot;
we can hang this in your room .
you can see it every morning , start to internalize it .
pretty soon nothing will keep you down .
but it &apos;s not true .
what are you talking about ?
lots of stuff that doesn &apos;t kill you makes you weaker .
my friend &apos;s grandfather had a heart attack .
now he needs a machine to breathe .
i &apos;ve seen him- at the supermarket .
now he needs to drive one of those little , like-
that &apos;s right . be negative .
it &apos;s just not a good poster , jay .
you &apos;re only making me stronger .

did you pack the bread for the ducks ?
yes .
not the whole @-@ wheat kind . the ducks don &apos;t like that .
they &apos;re ducks , mitchell . they don &apos;t care .
we both believe that
animals should play a big part in lily &apos;s life .
having grown up on a farm , i was surrounded by them .
they were more like brothers
and sisters than just , you know , livestock .
delicious brothers and sisters .
life on a farm- they know what they &apos;re getting into .
eesh .
oh , wait .
oh , it &apos;s the office .
don &apos;t answer it .
i have to .
it &apos;s like this every saturday . just ignore it .
well , maybe it &apos;s not that this time . hello ?
yeah .
that &apos;s nice .
holy- shel ? you all right , buddy ?
oh , hell .
oh , there &apos;s four of &apos; em , mitchell .
they &apos;re giving her little duck kisses .
oh , she &apos;s laughing . i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re missing this .
well , why not , cam ? i &apos;ve missed everything else .
she rolled over when i was in phoenix .
she started scooting when i was in court .
well , just tell &apos; em you &apos;re not coming in . you do enough for &apos; em .
well , you know that . i know that . you know ?
the only one who doesn &apos;t know that is my sucky boss .
he &apos;s the suckiest suck of all time .
he &apos;s a miserable son of a bitch who ...
may have heard everything i just said .
hi , honey .
hey .
when are you getting together with your gal pal ?
actually , i was just checking on that .
she &apos;s supposed to send me a message .
oh , you &apos;re facebook friends .
sure am . she &apos;s one of my 447 friends .
everybody wants a slice .
how long have you two been in touch with each other ?
uh , she tracked me down about a year ago .
what ? what &apos;s- what &apos;s that sound ?
mmm . nothing .
oh . here she is right now .
&quot; how about we meet at le reve at 7 : 30 ? &quot;
that sounds innocent enough- i mean-
drinks with an ex @-@ girlfriend at an intimate french restaurant .
honey , you &apos;re doing that thing when you say what i want you to say
but your tone seems mean .
let me guess . denise isn &apos;t married .
recently divorced . what &apos;s the big deal ?
come on , phil . you can &apos;t be that naive .
seriously , women in their 30s on the internet are like-
they &apos;re like ninjas .
they get into their little black outfits
and try and sneak their way into your marriage .
that &apos;s not denise .
here . read some of her messages .
you &apos;re gonna feel silly .
okay .
&quot; hey , phil . how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
you can &apos;t add the sexy voice .
&quot; hi , phil . how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
&quot; so glad to hear your neck is better . &quot;
are you seriously jealous ?
no ,
i am not jealous at all .
i just happen to know women better than you do ,
and that woman wants a slice .
okay . just to prove how wrong you are ,
i &apos;m gonna invite her over here for drinks .
fine with me . just hope it &apos;s fine with denise .
&quot; gee , phil , i really had my heart set on le reve . &quot;
that voice doesn &apos;t bother me .
kind of like it !
has he been acting weird around you ?
no , no . i &apos;ve been avoiding him all morning .
so you don &apos;t even know if he heard you .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing this .
and where are you ? i only have a half hour for lunch .
hello , handsome .
so this is where it happened .
just turn off the phone ,
roll down the window and we &apos;ll see if you can hear me .
go around ! we &apos;re re @-@ creating a faux pas !
thank you .
okay . can you hear me now ?
yeah , but just barely .
is this how loud you were talking ?
it might have been a little bit louder .
there was traffic . i almost had to shout .
you almost had to what ?
shout .
little bit louder now .
shout .
little bit louder now .
shout !
really , cam ? my job is at stake here , and-
oh , who are we kidding ? you can obviously hear me .
i am so screwed .
manny ? manny , come here a second , pal .
huh ?
i got some bad news , buddy .
what is it ?
well , there &apos;s no easy way to say this .
shel turtlestein is dead .
what ? how ?
i was down here reading the paper ,
and i heard this commotion up in your room .
so- so naturally , i go running up there .
and this mangy raccoon had busted through your screen .
he must have scampered up to where shel was .
by the time i walked in , he had-
the little bastard had him by the neck and shaking him .
gravel was flying everywhere .
he didn &apos;t even flinch .
he just stared at me with that smug look and then bolted .
if only i &apos;d have got here earlier .
may i see the body ?
baby , are you sure that &apos;s a good idea ?
it &apos;s something i have to do .
that &apos;s him .
sorry , pal .
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
yep . only the good die young .
but in school , we learn raccoons are nocturnal .
they sleep during the day .
they sure do , and this one must &apos;ve got up for a midnight snack .
you know , we &apos;ve all done that .
i guess so .
yeah .
it all adds up .
i don &apos;t think i can be in here right now . too many memories .
he &apos;ll be okay .
you lie .
what ?
i &apos;m colombian . i know a fake crime scene when i see one .
i was hanging up the new poster
and it fell on top of him . it was an accident .
you have to tell him .
no . i &apos;ve been through this before .
when mitchell was nine , i was supposed to take care of his bird .
it got out and flew into a fan .
it was like a bloody pillow fight .
my god . how many pets have you killed ?
just the two .
i took the heat on the bird . it was a big mistake .
to this day , mitchell looks at me ,
i see him thinking ,
&quot; that &apos;s the guy who killed fliza minnelli . &quot;
and what if he finds out ? then what ?
you &apos;ll be the guy that killed his pet and lied to him .
he &apos;s not gonna find out because i covered my tracks .
okay .
fliza minnelli ?
how did i not know that kid was gay ?
hey , luke .
big day for you , huh ?
why ?
because you will get to meet your real mom .
what ?
we all made a pact we &apos;d deny it until you turned 21 .
but that &apos;s the real reason dad &apos;s old girlfriend &apos;s coming over .
she &apos;s your mom ,
and if she likes you , you &apos;ll go live with her .
i &apos;m not adopted . i &apos;m asking mom .
you mean mrs. dunphy ? she &apos;s not going to tell you the truth .
i @-@ i &apos;m not-
i know .
just &apos; cause he called you a dork @-@ to @-@ dork salesman ?
the empire shakes back .
raccoons have five toes .
what &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t mean to bother you .
it &apos;s just confusing .
the footprints in my room only have four toes .
you know , i bet i know what happened .
i &apos;ll bet he lost those toes in a fight .
and that guy looked like he &apos;d been in a brawl or two .
one toe from each foot ?
maybe .
you know , manny , i think the only thing ...
that &apos;s gonna get you to stop asking all these questions ...
is for you to have a little closure .
what do you mean ?
well , i &apos;d like to throw a little memorial for shel .
it &apos;ll be good for all of us .
that way we get our grief out ,
and then we never have to talk about this ever , ever again .
hi . oh , careful . there &apos;s a thing .
yeah . good to see you .
hi ! oh , my god .
hi . i &apos;m claire .
you must be- oh . yeah . hi .
denise .
well- okay .
you &apos;re even prettier than the pictures that phil &apos;s always posting .
just a couple .
oh ?
shut up . every week .
he loves showing you off .
and my boyfriend likes your acapulco pictures ,
probably a little too much .
well , thank your boyfriend for me .
come on in , please .
oh , i brought you , um , some lifting intensifier .
not that you need it . it &apos;s a limited edition ,
thank you . thank you .
never mind .
oh , denise , i think you might know these people .
uh , that &apos;s haley
hi .
alex and-
luke .
i had curly hair just like that when i was little .
so ? that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
why don &apos;t we , uh , come on in , have a seat . please .
so what was my dad like in high school ?
only the most amazing break @-@ dancer ever .
no way .
oh , don &apos;t fire it up . what ? what ?
he had a boom box and a piece of cardboard in his locker .
and what was your dance name ?
o @-@ zone .
i drove him to his star search audition .
which is totally political , by the way .
o @-@ zone .
that is dead @-@ ass funny . i &apos;m so calling you that .
thank you .
wow . you really lucked out .
you have a beautiful wife , a gorgeous house .
and those kids- i could take luke home with me .
well , be my guest .
seriously , you go right ahead .
no ! i like it here !
alex , honey , will you go find out what &apos;s wrong with your brother ?
okay .
you know , um , if it &apos;s okay , i think i &apos;m just gonna use the , um-
oh , yeah . of course . down the hall .
left @-@ hand side . you can &apos;t miss it .
thanks .
okay , she &apos;s fantastic .
yes ?
yes . i feel awful .
when did i become this horribly cynical person ...
who assumes the worst about people ?
i first noticed it seven years- you &apos;re not .
such an idiot . is it-
oh , i &apos;ll show you . yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay . thanks .
so how are we gonna do this ?
i thought i &apos;d just point at the door .
so i was thinking
i was thinking too .
here ... is my hotel room key .
you can come by whenever you want .
that was funny this morning , huh-
when i pulled up next to you at that stoplight ?
funny ?
yeah . because i was on the phone with my partner ...
talking about how horrible his boss was- his .
and then you pull up . so-
anyway , i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
i &apos;m getting worried they &apos;re gonna move up our court date .
i need you to bust ass preparing .
&apos;cause if they call us on monday-
uh , you need to get that ?
no . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just a ...
picture of my daughter standing for the first time .
yeah , they do that . it &apos;s a big day .
anyway , i need you here tomorrow .
i know it &apos;s a sunday , but ,
uh , you think you can be on time , okay ?
actually , um , i have plans tomorrow ,
uh , so i won &apos;t be here .
i @-@ i have plans to stay at home
with my family and do absolutely nothing . okay .
but i will see you on monday .
so , you &apos;re in charge now , is that it ?
well , i just figure if my daughter can stand up ,
then so can i.
all right , look . we &apos;ve all been working hard lately , okay ?
but that &apos;s the job .
so either come in tomorrow or don &apos;t bother coming back again .
okay .
need the , uh , i.d. to
make the elevator go down to freedom ...
and this to complete my set .
turtle , reptile , pet .
shel turtlestein was many things .
i don &apos;t think i can do this without crying .
maybe we should just get to the cold cuts .
well , we wanna hear it .
jay , why don &apos;t you read it ?
you were with him at the end . remember ?
&quot; shel turtlestein was many things , &quot;
&quot; but above all , he was my friend . &quot;
&quot; when i didn &apos;t get a date with fiona gunderson , &quot;
&quot; shel was there . &quot;
&quot; when i didn &apos;t get to play the part of tevye , &quot;
&quot; shel was there . &quot;
&quot; and when a raccoon broke into my room , &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , shel was there .
&quot; i said a lot of things to my friend , &quot;
&quot; but the one thing i never got to say was good @-@ bye . &quot;
stop . i know what really happened .
you do ?
i left a bag of chips near my bed .
the raccoon must have smelled it . it &apos;s my fault he &apos;s dead .
sorry , shel .
jay , you don &apos;t have anything to say to manny ?
yeah .
manny .
shel forgives you .
thank you .
oh , denise .
these pictures are amazing . thank you .
sweetie , that perm .
technically , that &apos;s a jheri curl .
i just love to take pictures . i took this one of myself today .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna open a bottle of wine .
no . no . that &apos;s the worst idea .
no , no . i &apos;m not in the mood .
what am i , raised by a pack of wolves ?
hey . come on now .
honey .
you weren &apos;t completely wrong about denise .
how &apos;s that ?
she wants me .
to do what ?
it . her .
oh . oh , this is because of the thing i said about facebook ...
and everybody &apos;s hooking up , and now you &apos;re disappointed .
no . she bit the air right in front of me . like that .
and then look what she tried to give me .
anything i can help with ?
no .
i just- i can &apos;t find my corkscrew .
touch me .
okay . denise ,
i think somewhere along the line you got the wrong idea .
my head is full of wrong ideas .
you have such great taste , claire .
thank you .
i remember phil used to have really good taste too .
let me get a little of this .
oh , here it is .
phil , would you mind grabbing us a couple glasses ?
you betcha .
need me to grab anything ?
no !
okay , this is so wrong .
i know .
it &apos;s way more exciting when she &apos;s in the room , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
i still have my cheerleader outfit .
so do i.
but this still can &apos;t happen . when did that break ?
why are you wussing out ?
i never wussed in .
what about all those things you wrote on facebook ?
&quot; how was your day ? my neck is so sore . &quot;
why do people keep adding voices to these things ?
i didn &apos;t mean anything .
are you telling me that i wasted a year
of my life on this relationship ?
what relationship ?
how many other women have you led on ?
no , i don &apos;t know !
phil ?
phil , honey .
do you remember when you broke your arm
when we were first dating ?
yeah , uh , when i slipped on the ice .
right . that &apos;s so weird . because in this picture ,
you &apos;re sitting with denise and you have a broken arm , so-
yeah , that &apos;s- that &apos;s weird .
so you were still dating her when you started dating me ?
no .
phil ?
yeah . maybe .
there was a time , a little overlap ...
when , uh , i was trying to break things off with denise .
you took me to santa fe .
santa fe ? phil , you told me that was your father .
okay , i know the pain is fresh , but the lie is really old .
you know , this was a mistake . i &apos;m gonna leave .
claire , if i were you , i would kick him out .
maybe he &apos;d appreciate you
more after he spent a lonely night in a hotel .
at the radisson , by the airport .
you quit ?
it was amazing .
no , no . this is the new me , cam .
i am not letting people run my life anymore .
i should be nervous , but i &apos;m not . i &apos;m excited for you .
yes ! it &apos;s exciting ! it &apos;s exciting .
because you followed your heart , and that is worth celebrating .
cam , i just feel-
so liberated .
and i &apos;m not picking it up .
i like this guy .
i do too .
yes , we &apos;ll have to cut back a little bit .
but isn &apos;t it worth it if you feel
like you &apos;re living your life for the first time ?
totally .
what were we even waiting for ?
you will go back to teaching music ,
and then i &apos;ll just find something in a ... few months .
and until then , all we need to do is just sit back ...
and watch this little miracle here dazzle us .
i &apos;m tingling .
i am too .
it &apos;s like my heart is full for the first time in forever .
oh , god , it &apos;s really pounding .
it &apos;s like i feel the weight of
endless possibilities just sitting on my chest-
she is not doing anything , cam .
you &apos;re not panicking , are you ?
of course i am panicking .
no . don &apos;t panic .
if you panic , i panic !
i just quit my job . cam ! my god .
mitchell , i am used to nice things .
what are we gonna do ?
okay . no , no . just calm down .
this is what we &apos;re gonna do .
i am going to- i &apos;m gonna do what i &apos;m trained to do .
i am going to lie , grovel , debase myself
until i get what i want .
i am a lawyer , damn it .
mitchell !
no .
oh , no , you &apos;re right . the tie .
no . we &apos;ll find something better for you ,
something that works for all of us .
there &apos;s no plan &quot; b &quot; here , cam .
we have a mortgage . we have- we have a child to support .
hey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;re gonna figure it out .
i just want you to be happy , and you will be happy .
and that is something worth toasting .
let &apos;s just drink the cheap stuff ,
&apos;cause we might have to sell that bottle .
it &apos;s hard to sleep in a bed of lies .
isn &apos;t it , jay ?
kids get over these things pretty quick .
he &apos;s probably sleeping like a baby right now .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s wide awake , full of guilt .
well , i &apos;m going to sleep .
damn it !
hello , jay .
what are you doing up ?
waiting .
waiting for what ?
the truth . it wasn &apos;t a raccoon , was it ?
oh , all right . you got me . i killed shel .
all right ? i &apos;m sorry . it was an accident .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to be upset with me .
you and i got off to a rocky start .
lately , it &apos;s been pretty good .
i was afraid i &apos;d mess all that up
if you knew that i was the one that killed your pet .
now you &apos;re the guy who killed my pet
and made a stupid lie about it .
well , i don &apos;t think it was stupid .
i thought it was pretty clever .
i was just trying to avoid past mistakes .
look .
i know i can &apos;t make things all better right now ,
but maybe over time .
maybe .
get some rest .
since we &apos;re confessing things ,
you know that scratch on your car ?
the one that can &apos;t be buffed out ? yeah ?
you should probably know how it happened .
i know how it happened .
raccoon did it .
good night , jay .
good night , kid .
best thing i ever did
was quit a miserable job and start my own business .
thanks , dad .
no , it &apos;s not gonna be easy .
that &apos;s why gloria and i wanna give you a little something
to help you through it .
no , dad , i can &apos;t .
no . i want to , mitch .
okay , but , i mean , as soon as i &apos;m back on my feet , i really want to-
oh . oh , dad . no . you-
you tried to give me this 20 years ago when my pet snake died .
i did ?
yes .
zsa zsa gaboa ?
oh , that &apos;s adorable .
and you really didn &apos;t know that he was gay ?
i must &apos;ve , right ?
