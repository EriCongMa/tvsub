got you booked on the ground floor ,
like you asked -- is that right ?
yes , that sounds perfect . thank you .
anything else i can help you with ?
no , that &apos;s all . thanks .
i forgot my badge , but i got to grab these records .
look , just sign in on the form .
i &apos;ll run you through the system .
i &apos;m in a real hurry here .
i wonder if i can look while you run me through .
go ahead .
where are you on keen ?
she &apos;s still looking into this classified homicide .
the file she has is redacted .
no way she finds out what really happened .
you &apos;ve discovered something curious
about your husband , haven &apos;t you , lizzy ?
hey , you &apos;re not cleared to be in here !
who &apos;s your supervisor ?
we need to continue to keep an eye on her .
she &apos;s testifying today in a case
from her time in new york with mobile psych .
a mexican drug dealer -- hector lorca .
i want you at the courthouse .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ve got court this afternoon . just going over some notes .
mind if i come with you ?
nothing would make me happier than seeing hector lorca
being sent away for life .
why do i get the feeling that you &apos;re less interested
in watching lorca than in watching me ?
i don &apos;t know . are you hiding something ?
dembe made contact .
reddington wants to see you -- alone .
you &apos;re due in port @-@ au @-@ prince at noon
if we &apos;re gonna make your appointment .
this won &apos;t take long .
bring the car around .
&quot; it was only through the efforts of an fbi profiler
&quot; that suspicion began to fall on hector lorca ,
leading to his arrest and indictment . &quot;
well done , lizzy . very impressive .
you are aware , then , that i &apos;m due in court in three hours .
your case is about to go sideways .
why ? what &apos;s happened ?
lorca &apos;s people have reached out to me .
normally , i wouldn &apos;t give him the time of day .
he &apos;s a vicious , little drug @-@ lord thug .
certainly nothing there to hold my interest .
but their request is of great interest
because it concerns you .
what &apos;s he asking for ?
transportation out of the country ,
new identity , passport , bank account , credit cards ,
as well as the proper introductions
to reestablish his operations elsewhere .
and he wants it by tomorrow night .
for whatever reason , lorca is under the impression
he &apos;s about to be a free man .
i &apos;ve got a witness testifying today who &apos;s got him cold .
lorca &apos;s not going anywhere .
something is going to happen , lizzy .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to have
a very good day in court at all .
francesca trevino was abducted
from a school parking lot .
lisa molinera was taken outside a movie theater .
bill jackson --
he kissed his wife goodbye one day to go for a jog .
miguel romero ,
daniela morales ...
roberto pena .
109 victims over the course of six years --
members of u.s. and mexican law @-@ enforcement agencies
preparing cases against the criminal cartel
run by mr. lorca .
they were witnesses prepared to testify against him .
they are all presumed dead .
none of them have ever been found .
mr. pena , can you please tell the court
what your connection is to this tragic situation ?
that &apos;s my son , bobby pena .
he was a member of the u.s. border patrol
when he was taken .
i never saw him again .
i know who did it .
i saw him .
i know who killed my son !
oh , my god ! he &apos;s not breathing !
get the paramedics in here !
bailiff , secure the defendant ! i want this courtroom cleared !
what is that ?
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
what is going to happen now ?
if the juror can &apos;t continue , they &apos;ll bring in an alternate .
for now , we &apos;re gonna keep you in a holding area .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
what about my wife ?
i &apos;ll go and find her .
i &apos;ll bring her back here .
please .
they got lorca secure .
just got it from the emt --
the heart attack was chemically induced .
that juror was poisoned .
stairs !
the manufacturer has replicated the specs
of the fim @-@ 92 with a few small improvements .
it &apos;s lighter , more consistent tracking .
i &apos;m confident your client will be thrilled .
put him on .
mr. reddington is not avai--
now !
it seems to be urgent .
yes , you also have a few dozen of those .
sweetheart , not really the most convenient time for me .
i don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass . where are you ?
haiti .
doing what ?
keeping up appearances . i &apos;m a criminal .
the minute i stop being one , i become quite useless to you .
my witness is gone . lorca &apos;s people contacted you .
what did they say , exactly ?
what i told you is what i know .
beyond that , i really can &apos;t help .
a man &apos;s life is at stake !
a man &apos;s life is always at stake --
and tragically low stakes , at that .
i shouldn &apos;t have to remind you i did not offer my services
so that i could help you round up
your run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill drug lord or what have you .
you all seem to be doing a perfectly mediocre job of that on your own .
i &apos;m after the big game , lizzy , the ones that matter .
this case matters to me ,
to the hundreds of families who deserve to know
what happened to their loved ones .
no bodies were ever recovered .
they never got to say goodbye , to bury their dead .
did you say hundreds ?
and no bodies have ever been found .
what ? what are you thinking ?
nothing . you should go home , lizzy .
pour yourself a chardonnay and move on .
your witness is most likely dead .
i think you already know that .
and if what you &apos;re telling me is true ,
you &apos;ll probably never find him , either .
经追查 &quot; 失踪 &quot; 线索
how you holding up ?
fine .
nice try . but i always know when you &apos;re lying .
really ?
yeah . i know all your tells .
right now , you &apos;re telling me that you want to be alone .
and that &apos;s okay , but ...
i just wanted to say
what happened today is just part of your job .
you know , you deal with bad people ,
and sometimes bad things are gonna happen ,
and it &apos;s not your fault .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s --
i mean , besides the best day ever , right ?
right .
hey , i get it . bad day at work .
come home . don &apos;t want to talk to anybody .
especially someone whose stitches are officially oozing .
it &apos;s so gross . i know .
and you park yourself in here
and cheer yourself up with memories of better times .
we were in boston that weekend .
you had that job interview .
yeah . it was a great trip .
yeah .
god , when was the last time that we did that , you know ,
that we just packed up the car and got the hell out of here ?
because we need that . like right now .
you have no idea .
i know .
do i really have tells ?
lizzy , you &apos;re an open book ,
which is one of the things i love about you .
&apos;cause i always know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
keen .
we found out where they took pena .
an eyewitness saw a white van leaving the courthouse .
they found it abandoned 10 blocks away .
traffic camera picked up the swap car .
apb got a hit on the plate from local p.d.
the desk clerk said
it was a large black duffel bag .
there &apos;s no sign of him , liz . i &apos;m sorry .
has forensics been through ?
they &apos;re going through now .
so far , they found a hair on the bed skirt ,
but we don &apos;t think it &apos;s human .
the desk clerk said he saw the suspect with a dog .
we found traces of adhesive on the walls .
we think he maybe used tarps or plastic sheeting .
it &apos;s a motel room .
should be latent prints all over , and there &apos;s nothing .
he &apos;s wiped the place clean .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about your case .
what do you have so far ?
i &apos;m at the crime scene .
or what we think is the crime scene .
you didn &apos;t find anything .
not much .
tape residue on the walls ?
how do you know that ?
look in the tub .
run your fingers around the drain .
what do you smell ?
chemicals .
you see , lizzy . now i &apos;m interested .
why ?
the stewmaker is in town .
you &apos;re going to need a plumber .
the stewmaker is a true blacklister ,
the only fellow to engage
when one has a particular sort of disposal problem .
he &apos;s a chemical expert
who turns his victims into chemical stew ,
thus the nom de guerre .
no dna . no nothing .
he makes corporeal problems literally disappear .
but it &apos;s much more than the proficiency
of his tradecraft that gets him on the list .
he &apos;s a ... trophy collector --
remembrances of his victims .
memori morti .
now , you &apos;ve lost your witness and with him your case .
but the stewmaker is the key to so much more .
he &apos;s served the needs of international syndicates ,
repressive regimes ,
anyone with a need and the means to pay .
the stewmaker knows where all the bodies are buried .
he &apos;s got the answers to hundreds of unsolved murders .
so , how do we get him ?
he &apos;s notoriously cautious .
i don &apos;t even know who he is or where he bases his operation .
and believe me , i &apos;ve tried to find him .
lorca knows .
if not his name , he knows how to make contact .
yes .
i suggest you encourage mr. lorca
to share that information .
the stewmaker is obviously here now , but he won &apos;t be for long .
and if you let him slip away ,
he &apos;ll be as gone as his victims
and you &apos;ll never see him again .
we know that luis pena is dead .
we know about the stewmaker .
my client has no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
cooperate , help us nail this guy ,
and we can talk a plea agreement .
you were responsible for luis &apos; safety .
i &apos;m sure you promised him
all sorts of protection to compel him to testify .
this is on you .
i had nothing to do with it .
the government is dropping this case .
that is a surprise .
you know , the thing about narco dollars
is that they always seem to find their way
into some pretty unsavory hands .
we &apos;ve got files on shell corporations ,
numbered accounts , all related to a mysterious hector lorca .
but you &apos;re not such a mystery anymore .
you &apos;re bringing money @-@ laundering charges ?
based on what evidence ?
are you dropping this case or not ?
this case , yes .
but homeland security suspects
that you may be laundering money
through entities with financial ties
to terrorist organizations .
that &apos;s a load of crap , and you know it .
why would they think that ?
because we told them he is .
homeland &apos;s gonna stick you in a nice hole someplace
while we check it out ,
and that could take some time , you know .
give us the stewmaker ,
and we &apos;ll set you up in a nice , cozy supermax .
i don &apos;t think you really understand who you &apos;re hunting .
this man , he is much more dangerous than your agents .
i &apos;ll take my chances with homeland .
i &apos;m a survivor . i like my odds .
once i turn you over to homeland ,
it &apos;s beyond my ability to help you !
you &apos;ve helped me enough , agent keen .
you &apos;ve disrupted my business , my life .
you &apos;ve embarrassed me , my family .
you think you know me , with your profiles ?
you have no idea .
come on !
we just got the surveillance footage from the airport .
what did you know about the transport attack ?
how did he know where to strike ?
i swear to god , if you had anything to do with --
what you &apos;re forgetting is we want the same thing ,
agent ressler .
why would he kidnap agent keen ?
what &apos;s his play here ?
i have a contract with lorca
to personally hand him a new identity .
that &apos;s never gonna happen .
your witness is dead , you lost lorca ,
and he took agent keen .
i &apos;d say my meeting with lorca might be the equivalent
of you falling on your ass
and landing in a pile of christmas .
we &apos;ll need time to set up a sting .
he &apos;s been evading capture for years .
he &apos;ll be more on guard than ever .
any change of plans , and we &apos;ll lose him .
i meet with lorca alone .
an fbi agent &apos;s life is in jeopardy .
there &apos;s no bargaining here !
when confronting complex equations ,
the simplest solution is most often the correct one .
you lost her . i can find her . it &apos;s that simple .
i &apos;m coming with you .
then understand i take no responsibility for your safety .
and the fbi backs off .
no surveillance , no wires ,
or you can find what &apos;s left of agent keen yourselves .
as soon as you have information on agent keen , contact me .
i &apos;ll get backup , and we &apos;ll take him .
no . i &apos;m gonna make him feel safe .
lorca &apos;s gonna walk , and you &apos;re gonna have to just trust me .
lorca &apos;s not going anywhere .
and i &apos;ll never trust you . you know why ?
because after tracking me for years ,
you &apos;ve come up with one undeniable truth --
i only do what &apos;s good for me .
and that is a person you can trust , donald .
now let &apos;s go .
lorca will have questions about you .
you &apos;ll need breviloquent answers .
ready ?
good evening , gentlemen . i &apos;m raymond reddington .
mr. lorca , i &apos;m raymond reddington .
i didn &apos;t expect two of you .
oh , this is special agent donald ressler
of the federal bureau of investigation .
it must be open season on the fbi . i like it .
he insisted , dying to meet you .
what &apos;s he saying ?
he &apos;s telling his man to be ready to cut off your head .
you want to tell me why i shouldn &apos;t ?
one chance . make it a good one .
better start talking , donald .
red ...
kill him .
he &apos;s also a wonderful dancer .
how do you think red got you a new i.d. ?
new passports ?
established interpol data background ?
new history , false prints ? that &apos;s all me .
i &apos;m not the guy you kill , hector .
i &apos;m the guy you pay .
and if i don &apos;t show up for dinner tonight ,
you &apos;re dead by morning .
is this true ?
it is indeed . crooked as a corsican highway .
he &apos;s an asset .
so if you &apos;re gonna kill my inside man ,
the least you could do is thank him first .
your new life .
i hope it &apos;s an interesting one .
i &apos;ve also arranged a flight to take you to venezuela .
you just need to sit tight for at least 12 hours .
no . i &apos;m leaving now , tonight .
not with my assistance , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re bad for business . you &apos;ve made a mess .
you &apos;ve abducted an fbi agent . i presume she &apos;s dead .
i don &apos;t know .
in any event , the city &apos;s locked down .
i can &apos;t have you getting busted
with my fingerprints all over you .
when i arrange transport , it &apos;s flawless .
i won &apos;t compromise my people .
every sat tracking system , every surveillance camera ,
every law @-@ enforcement officer in this town is looking for you .
no way you &apos;re getting out of here anytime soon .
so just sit tight .
take your new identity , catch a ride on my plane ,
and let me clean up your mess .
full @-@ service provider , huh ?
yes .
so , where is the man holding the agent ?
you have a problem with me disposing of this bitch ?
agent keen will soon disappear .
that is the price for taking everything i have .
see , that &apos;s the problem right there .
you let your emotions get the best of you ,
which is how people wind up in jail , hector .
stupid people .
i need the name and location
of the man holding elizabeth keen .
are you sure it is not you who &apos;s acting on emotion ?
it sounds personal .
you got me .
it is personal .
i want your man .
so let me spell it out for you .
you get away .
agent ressler here saves agent keen .
he looks good .
and everyone feels better about themselves .
i need a name . now .
i don &apos;t have a name .
and i have no idea where he took her .
then good luck to you , mr. lorca .
i have a contact .
that is all .
tell me about the suspect .
got a contact from lorca ,
but it &apos;s through a mailbox rental place in g @-@ town .
name of the mailbox renter was an alias -- bill conners .
we found his driver &apos;s license at the dmv
and matched his fingerprints
to chemical purchases in maryland .
the stewmaker has a name -- stanley r. kornish .
runs a dental practice in kitzmiller , maryland .
not 100 % , but kornish is
definitely person of interest number one .
i hope you &apos;re on your way to kitzmiller .
we are .
time to go .
my name is elizabeth . i have a name .
i &apos;m a person .
i have a husband . i want you to know who i am .
dogs are not our whole life ,
but they do make some lives whole .
dembe , would you dial
the maryland state office of animal control , please ?
come on .
maryland animal control .
this is diana . can i help you ?
y @-@ yes . h @-@ hello , diana . this is stanley kornish .
i &apos;m in a bit of a panic .
my dog has gotten out ,
and i &apos;ve lost my cellphone with the tracking code .
i was wondering if i might bother you for the code
and if you could reboot the application
for this mobile device .
he &apos;s an emotional support dog . please hurry .
my heart , it &apos;s pounding , and i &apos;m having trouble breathing .
who are you ?
i deserve that at least ,
since you &apos;re gonna kill me .
i mean , you understand decency , don &apos;t you ?
at the very least , i should know the name
of the person who &apos;s gonna take my life .
i know the name they call you out there .
it &apos;s disparaging , disrespectful .
but it &apos;s not who you are , is it ?
it &apos;s not how you feel about yourself .
what name are you referring to ?
you don &apos;t know ?
what name ?
they call you the stewmaker ,
because of the chemicals you use to dissolve human bodies .
nature .
what about nature ?
it &apos;s the transference of energy .
energy ...
... cannot die .
it can only be transformed .
is that what you do -- transform energy ?
that &apos;s what nature does when the body dies .
but you do it very differently .
yes .
faster .
cleaner .
better .
go ! go ! go ! run !
move ! fbi ! hands where we can see them !
oh , my god ! what ? ! what ? !
oh , my god ! what ? what ?
let &apos;s see your hands !
everything &apos;s okay .
no ! no !
we &apos;re fbi .
no ! no ! where --
where are you taking my son ? !
mom ! mom !
he &apos;s gonna be fine , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re gonna be okay . all right ?
mom !
he &apos;ll be fine , ma &apos;am .
are you eleanore kornish ?
yes .
is your husband stanley kornish ?
yes .
where is he now , ma &apos;am ?
i don &apos;t know . he isn &apos;t here .
w @-@ w @-@ what &apos;s happening ? !
why do you want to talk to stanley ? !
where is my boy ? !
easy . easy . he &apos;s gonna be fine , ma &apos;am .
he &apos;ll be fine .
what about family ?
you seem like ...
a father .
you have kids ?
a son ?
a son , then .
how old is he ? how old is your son ?
he &apos;s 11 .
my son -- he &apos;s 11 .
i married late .
she &apos;s a n @-@ nice woman .
i knew it .
a caring father .
what about you ? are you a mother ?
no .
that &apos;s good .
i was -- i was asked to make you suffer .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s my job .
it &apos;s my job to read people .
and you &apos;re not a killer .
i &apos;m a lot of things , liz .
there &apos;s a nerve cluster just under the shoulder muscle .
just wait .
the pain should be quite intense .
my husband &apos;s a dentist .
he -- he would never do anything wrong .
where do you think he might be now , mrs. kornish ?
oh , it &apos;s the weekend . h @-@ he likes to get away .
he goes fishing .
where does he fish ?
we have a little cabin up in ...
i don &apos;t go ... there . i @-@ it &apos;s his place .
tell us about the cabin .
it &apos;s not far . up at backbone mountain .
kind of in the middle of nowhere .
near lamb knolls , i think .
what &apos;s the name of the road ?
up there , they don &apos;t have names .
some of the roads aren &apos;t even roads .
they &apos;re just dirt paths to the woods .
please , i have to know . what has stanley done ?
i need a chopper now .
i want tact ops on site within the hour .
and call ahead to forestry .
we &apos;re gonna need guys that know those woods .
we &apos;re getting very close , dembe .
pull in at the next shop . we &apos;re gonna need meat .
tell me , how does it work ?
how do you make them disappear so perfectly ?
it is perfect , isn &apos;t it ?
what did you give me ?
a sedative .
it &apos;ll eventually cause paralysis
yet maintain your sensitivity to pain .
hey , you don &apos;t have to watch this . go on .
why don &apos;t you go play ? go .
why are you doing this ? !
you don &apos;t take life . you clean up death .
everything changes .
everything evolves .
this is my evolution .
you know what i think ?
i think this idea of you vanishing people to aid nature is a lie .
i think you &apos;re trying to dissolve something else .
your past , maybe ?
whatever the horrible thing was that twisted you up inside
and made you into the freak that you are !
we &apos;re gonna run two team lines here --
one from lamb knolls to the southwest road ,
the other from the fire road back to the lake .
let &apos;s move !
you know , i was wrong about you .
you &apos;re not perfect .
hello , lizzy .
the effects will dissipate soon .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
okay .
shall we get started ?
a farmer comes home one day to find that everything
that gives meaning to his life is gone .
crops are burned , animals slaughtered ,
bodies and broken pieces of his life strewn about .
everything that he loved , taken from him .
his children .
one can only imagine the pit of despair ,
the hours of job @-@ like lamentations ,
the burden of existence .
he makes a promise to himself in those dark hours .
a life &apos;s work erupts from his ...
knotted mind .
years go by .
his suffering becomes ...
... complicated .
one day he stops .
the farmer , who ... is no longer a farmer ...
sees the wreckage he &apos;s left in his wake .
it is now he who burns .
it is he who slaughters .
and he knows , in his heart ...
he must pay .
doesn &apos;t he , stanley ?
no , red .
he couldn &apos;t help it .
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe he could change .
maybe he &apos;s not damaged beyond repair .
maybe he could make amends
to all those that he &apos;s hurt so terribly .
or maybe not .
where &apos;s kornish ?
we &apos;ve had a little incident .
agent keen needs medical attention .
how did you get in here ?
that &apos;s a pretty blouse .
get a medic in here now !
it &apos;s all over now . it &apos;s over now . it &apos;s okay .
everything &apos;s okay .
nothing .
here . it &apos;s horrifying .
but at least you can give peace of mind
to some of the families .
you &apos;re no better than him .
you gonna tell on me , lizzy ?
tell harold how bad i &apos;ve been ?
you &apos;re a monster .
yes .
how can you live with that ?
by saving your life .
the book i just gave agent keen
should help to put lorca or many of his kind away
for a nice long time .
yeah , but lorca got away .
cost of doing business .
no , you &apos;re not just gonna let him go .
he was offensive . you didn &apos;t like that .
he is on my jet .
i @-@ i know things have been a little weird between us lately .
i think what we were taling about ,
getting out of town for a few days--
i think we could really use it .
so i booked it .
it &apos;s just three nights back at that place we loved ,
the , uh , tellamy cove inn .
you know , it has that restaurant that you like and ...
it might be fun .
yeah ?
you &apos;re gonna get through this .
i promise .
