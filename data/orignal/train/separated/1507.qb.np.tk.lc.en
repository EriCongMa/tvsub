not so bad .
better than look from outside .
drop the cool girl acts . it &apos;s perfect .
so , it turns out our house has mold --
which is not a reflection on this excellent homemaker .
anyway , we have to vacate the house
while it &apos;s being treated .
i got us the last room at a hotel nearby .
i was a little concerned about
the five of us sharing a room .
but for one night ? i don &apos;t know , could be fun .
watch it !
look out !
haley , i need the wi @-@ fi corner . get down .
ugh , i need instagram
to know there &apos;s still beauty in the world !
luke , you &apos;ll set off the dogs !
look what i got from the vending machine
in the lobby -- a charleston chew .
remember these ?
can someone please tell the nigerian family
to shut their dogs up ? !
check it out ! according to this wrapper ,
we can win tickets to the 2005 all @-@ star game !
i think i &apos;m most excited about the night .
it &apos;s gonna be like camping .
yeah .
okay , does anybody else need to use the bathroom ?
no .
great . oh , finally .
i forgot my night guard .
sorry , mom .
what am i thinking ? this isn &apos;t my book .
great -- now that we talked about it ,
i need to use the bathroom again .
what is the point of a last call ...
coming through !
if you guys are just gonna do whatever -
someone else sleep in the tub tonight . like haley .
okay , now that we &apos;re all here , can we just --
no !
it &apos;s that stupid train .
it &apos;s gonna wake up those stupid dogs .
they &apos;re gonna start their stupid barking and --
they didn &apos;t hear it .
quiet , everybody . no &quot; good nights . &quot;
son of a gun . ray chapman just died .
i know !
he used to give me the best bonings .
you &apos;re thinking of our butcher -- ray eastman .
i hope .
no , chapman was a navy buddy .
i always meant to write to him .
oh , jay , that &apos;s so sad .
i hated his guts .
it &apos;s like they say -- you cannot put these things off .
thanks god manny &apos;s here .
i always get so nervous
when he goes out with that older boy , sam .
i guess i could try texting the widow .
they always stay in the driveway like that .
what are they doing ?
jay , go look .
gloria , can &apos;t you do it ?
no , i can &apos;t do it because you know
that he always say that i am nosey .
and manny &apos;s been acting very suspicious lately
i think that that older boy &apos;s a bad influence on him .
can you see ?
looks like he &apos;s driving a mustang .
pretty sweet one , too .
what the hell ?
what ?
they &apos;re kissing .
sam &apos;s a girl .
that gives a bigger reaction ?
manny has a girlfriend , and he has not told me ?
here he comes ,
and let &apos;s not ambush him with a bunch of questions .
no . he &apos;s probably gonna want to play this pretty cool .
oh , hey , guys .
well , heading up .
no , wait !
how was your night ?
oh , you know , just teens being teens .
anyway , big game tomorrow . night .
manny &apos;s first girlfriend is a senior with a mustang .
i &apos;d have put my money on a sophomore with a mustache .
you &apos;ve been sawing
at that chicken fried steak for 10 minutes .
just order something else .
mitchell , it &apos;s game day .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s my lucky meal .
oh , god . here we go .
well , that &apos;s attractive .
you look like a puppy with a slipper .
under my leadership , the varsity football team
is now 5 @-@ 0 -- new school record , very exciting .
cam , i can smell your hat from over here .
can i please just pop it in the laundry ?
and wash the luck off ? i &apos;ve worn it to every game .
see , he knows nothing about sports .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve given him a pass .
he doesn &apos;t have to go to games .
although -- i @-@ i do -- i hear it &apos;s fun .
three hours on a splintery plank
with parents squealing with delight
as their children maim each other .
he &apos;d know if he came . the seats are aluminum now .
okay .
some pie on the house , coach .
oh , and that couple over there picked up your tab .
oh ! thank you .
at least i &apos;m getting some perks out of all this craziness
and -- nope , they just covered your part .
lot of pool out there .
how about some marco polo ?
nah .
just like the old days , huh ?
no .
not it !
dad ! really !
bunch of complainers out here , huh ?
honey , i &apos;m gonna go for a run ,
and then maybe after we go for a swim .
okay .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a body spray called sex grenade .
one of the divorced dads in the hotel recommended it .
that smell is driving me crazy .
then it &apos;s working .
what the hell ? it &apos;s stuck .
get away from us !
there &apos;s nowhere else to go !
i can &apos;t breathe !
open the door !
there &apos;s an actual maid service at this hotel ? !
dad , no !
it &apos;s empty .
we &apos;re okay , guys .
i &apos;m gonna toss this .
when something like that happens ,
it makes you think , huh ?
luke !
seriously ? !
claire ?
nope .
i mean , what am i doing ?
i am totally at the wrong room .
are you ?
i &apos;m sorry , phil .
it &apos;s not what it looks like .
rumpled bed , wine ...
bra .
i knew it !
you &apos;ve been sleeping by yourself .
how could you ?
i am so sorry . i just couldn &apos;t take it anymore ,
and i needed a place where -- what is that smell ?
betrayal .
family meeting in the living room .
aren &apos;t we already in -- - in the living room !
there &apos;s no easy way to say this .
your mother &apos;s leaving us .
she &apos;s found another room that makes her happy .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s not your fault .
okay , look , i needed a little space ,
and there was a room that opened up down the hall --
then one thing led to another .
spare us , claire .
so , wait . mom &apos;s staying in that other room ?
you can visit her on the weekends .
aren &apos;t we here for just one more day ?
i knew you &apos;d be the one to lash out .
if mom is staying in an empty room ,
why can &apos;t some of us stay with her ?
you happy , claire ?
you &apos;re breaking up the family .
no , guys , your father is right .
this is my fault .
i should go back to my room
and just think about what i &apos;ve done .
come on . we hate it here .
i cannot look at that red hair
in the shower drain one more second .
look around here , people . none of us have red hair .
okay , one of you has to go with your mom ,
so we &apos;ll do this the democratic way .
whoever pulls the short crust --
come on , dad .
no , i don &apos;t want to do that .
fine !
you all want to go , then go .
turn your back on your father ,
just spare me
the empty apologies and the crocodile ...
okay .
finally .
tears .
i call &quot; no bathtub . &quot;
another good @-@ luck gift basket , daddy .
oh , they just let 7 @-@ year @-@ olds sign for these . okay .
how nice !
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve got here .
eggplant jelly ?
what do they send if they
don &apos;t like you ?
&quot; go coach , go dolphins ! &quot;
i don &apos;t know . it seems a little &quot; go &quot; heavy .
pink salt ?
what is wrong with people ?
okay , i got to skedaddle .
i &apos;ll see you guys after the big game .
all right , then .
and we &apos;re waiting because ...
forgot my keys .
yes , you did . right over there .
every time .
yes , every time .
i forgot them on the day of our first win ,
and it &apos;s worked ever since .
now scooch to the left .
i &apos;m not letting you do the coffee @-@ table thing again .
mitchell , superstitions are a big part of sports .
and witchcraft and cults and voodoo , but --
hey , look , you know what ?
i &apos;m not asking you to like football ,
but i like football .
football was everything to me growing up .
i was just a big , gay farm kid
until i joined the football team and i finally fit in .
now , i don &apos;t expect you to like it .
i don &apos;t expect you to come to the games .
but i do expect you to be 5 % less condescending .
now scooch .
go , dolphins !
it &apos;s too much -- the car keys , the coffee table ,
your roller skate on the front porch .
i @-@ is there any chocolate in any of these ?
you &apos;ll have to scrape it off this sun @-@ dried tomato .
i suppose on some level ,
it &apos;s possible that he might have a point .
i hate sports . i do .
but if you had my dad and my upbringing ...
i mean , have you ever been picked last for a team , lily ?
well , at gym the other day , these mean girls --
i mean , you have no idea , lily , the bullying and the teasing .
they put me in the ball bag .
if i am a little dismissive ,
it &apos;s only because of my harrowing backstory .
they said if i told , they would kill you and daddy .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve been making this all about myself .
i haven &apos;t even been thinking about cam .
this is crazy .
yes , this is crazy .
who cares if i like football ?
daddy likes football ,
and i like daddy , so -- i need to tell him .
i need to tell him i &apos;m gonna be more supportive ,
and i need to -- oh , honey , are you calling him for me ?
yes , i have a complaint .
can i please talk to harry or david ?
what &apos;s that smell ?
i believe you &apos;re referring to my bold new scent --
&quot; sex gre @-@ nod . &quot;
is that for sam , your friend that is a girl ,
but has the name of a boy ?
i knew you were spying on me last night .
yes , i have a girlfriend .
let me save you some snooping .
she &apos;s smart . she &apos;s pretty . she &apos;s a senior .
she &apos;s our high school &apos;s &quot; it &quot; girl ,
and &quot; it &quot; dumped the captain of the basketball team for me .
so , you &apos;re only 15 , and you go out with the senior .
are you sure you want to play that game ?
are you ?
i just want to --
mom , you &apos;re butting in .
i just want to meet her .
oh , absolutely not .
it &apos;s way too early .
promise me you &apos;ll stay out of this until i &apos;m ready .
that &apos;s as close as you &apos;re gonna get to a &quot; yes . &quot;
okay , i got to go get ready .
sam &apos;s gonna pick me up for a bite before the game .
jay , i don &apos;t like this .
eh , it &apos;s not my favorite exit of his ,
but it beats the dramatic stage bow .
no , that girl is too advanced for him .
i don &apos;t want her to force him
to do anything that he doesn &apos;t want to .
i think he &apos;ll be okay with whatever she wants to do .
okay , you go because i cannot butt in .
maybe you can talk to her .
maybe you can put the fear of god into her !
what , bust her windshield ?
break her pinkie ?
i go disconnect the security camera .
nice ride .
thanks .
you know , manny &apos;s not really used to ...
fast cars .
and i don &apos;t know what your intentions are
with this mustang , but , um ,
i suggest you take things nice and slow .
we clear ?
um , sounds like you really want me to drive slow .
no , uh , what i think i &apos;m saying is ,
hands can do things .
no , uh , hang on .
young people have urges , which is only natural .
i also have urges .
okay .
i mean , the point is , you &apos;re 18 .
and i have my eye on you .
jay , what are you doing ?
go inside .
no means no !
run !
score !
win !
yes !
and with 4 minutes left in the second quarter ...
... that &apos;s dolphins -- 27 ...
... badgers -- nothing .
all right ! what a game !
our guys were playing like
they come from a much poorer neighborhood .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s funny
that we haven &apos;t seen that girl , sam ,
the one named for a boy ?
i mean , it &apos;s a big game .
if she was really his girlfriend , she --
gloria , be realistic .
what do you want ,
her standing in the first row
with a sign saying &quot; go , manny &quot; ?
i &apos;m just saying that ...
&apos;cause that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s her ?
she &apos;s pretty .
she made that sign for him ?
i told you , she &apos;s a great girl .
and look -- she used glitter ,
for god &apos;s sakes .
jay , i think that she really likes him . look .
she looks at him the same way that i look at him .
so sweet .
and in her case , healthy .
go , dolphins !
we &apos;re really giving our fans
their money &apos;s worth tonight , boys .
he came .
he &apos;s at the 30 , at the 20,
the 10 , and he &apos;s in for a touchdown .
badgers score .
what ? !
we haven &apos;t let anyone run back a kick all year .
what happened ?
run ! tackle !
try !
touchdown , badgers .
what &apos;s going on , coach ?
all of a sudden , everyone &apos;s just off .
yep .
at least mitchell finally made it to a game .
yep .
focus , defense .
they got two players hurting us .
it &apos;s not that much to keep track of !
shoot . mustard .
i couldn &apos;t tell manny because it would kill him ,
and i couldn &apos;t tell gloria
because she would kill me .
hell of a way to ruin a nice hot dog .
end of the third quarter , and we &apos;re all tied up .
coach tucker !
okay , hey , everybody , grab a cup of water .
maybe you could hold on to those , huh ?
how exciting is this , huh ?
oh , you dropped your little clipboard .
i thought you had a work dinner tonight .
i did , but i blew them off .
i &apos;d rather be here supporting the team .
you better go , dolphins !
yeah , love that , but , you know , the game &apos;s almost over .
you might want to beat traffic , so ...
i thought you &apos;d be happy that i was here .
why do i feel like you &apos;re trying to get rid of me ?
i have no idea . it &apos;s not because you &apos;re a jinx .
a jinx ? do you think i &apos;m a jinx ?
no ! no , no , no , no , no .
this all can &apos;t be on you .
i &apos;m hearing a lot of things
that sound like the opposite of what you &apos;re --
hey , coach ! we need a play .
and malcolm just got stung by a bee .
i got to go . a bee ? !
okay , get some baking soda .
hey , do you guys know where the bar is ?
you &apos;re here , my friend .
what are you in the mood for ?
well , i &apos;d like my wife and kids back ,
but i &apos;d take a chardonnay .
ah , i thought you had that look about you .
i &apos;m lester . this is carl .
hey , carl .
hey .
i know it hurts now , but , uh ,
being a man @-@ about @-@ town ,
on your own , has its perks .
this is on me .
ah . so , who left who ?
she did .
she said she needed some space ,
got her own place , and took the kids .
chin up , my friend .
adventure awaits .
carl , could you swipe me ?
nacho machine ate my card .
phil .
hey , ayoola . this is my neighbor here .
pool ?
oh , no , thanks .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d be much fun right now .
okay .
phil , buddy ,
you get an offer like that , you got to jump on it ,
even if it &apos;s just a one @-@ time thing .
i don &apos;t know -- she &apos;s nice , her kids seem great ,
but i don &apos;t even speak her language .
who said anything about speaking ?
i think you guys have got the wrong idea .
my wife &apos;s getting back tomorrow .
oh , of course she is , champ .
uh , i &apos;m just saying , life is short ,
and why deny yourself a little innocent fun ?
your wife certainly hasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m up for it .
okay , but don &apos;t wait too long to start living life , phil .
thanks , guys .
you know when you don &apos;t think about
who was in there before you ,
a hotel bath can be really quite relaxing .
do you know if alex got my text ?
your swipe @-@ card wine .
thank you .
hey , so , i was talking
to those sad guys that are in the lobby ,
and they said the hotel &apos;s been half @-@ empty all week .
half @-@ full , honey .
be positive for once in your life .
okay , not quite the point i was making .
i want to hear your point , but right now ,
this magic juice is gonna help mama
turn that bathtub into a swim @-@ up bar .
i &apos;m just saying we could have been
in two hotel rooms this entire time .
okay .
wait .
so , dad put us through hell for nothing ?
do you guys hear that ?
the sound of my hero falling off his pedestal ?
uh , no .
the sound of your hero
playing with the nigerians in the pool .
okay , so , when i say &quot; marco &quot; --
hi , marco .
no , no , i &apos;m phil .
i &apos;m gonna say &quot; marco &quot; and then --
hi , phil .
let &apos;s take it from the top .
i &apos;m gonna close my eyes .
no , no , not -- not you , ayoola .
you keep your eyes open .
can you open ...
marco !
no , uh , iyapo , can you stay in the pool ?
that way , when i say &quot; marco &quot;
hi , marco .
come on .
he has a room to himself , and that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing ?
how surprised should we be ?
i mean , he &apos;s basically a hyperactive toddler
that just wants to play all the time .
yeah .
although it &apos;s really more about
wanting to spend time with us .
it &apos;s kind of all dad ever wants .
that &apos;s true .
he &apos;s , like , obsessed with us .
do you think he lied about the hotel being booked
just so we &apos;d all have to spend time together ?
and we totally ditched him .
even after he jumped on that sex grenade for us .
butterfingers . i spilled my wine in the tub .
would you mind , sweetie ?
what ?
only 6 seconds left .
the dolphins still down by 3 .
40 short yards , 6 long seconds .
we &apos;ve got this .
on three , &quot; go , dolphins . &quot;
two , three go , dolphins !
all right , manny , this is a real hail mary .
win or lose , i still have a hot girlfriend .
dolphins come to the line .
there &apos;s the snap .
tommy park back to pass .
he looks downfield .
hit it .
hit it ! hit it !
he &apos;s got a receiver .
touchdown , dolphins !
we won ! mitchell , we won !
oh , no !
hello ?
mitchell , we won !
and i looked back , and you weren &apos;t there !
please don &apos;t be mad at me .
i &apos;m on the fence .
i don &apos;t blame you .
i feel stupid for making you think this was all your fault .
no ! i &apos;m on the fence .
look to your right .
i was trying to leave ,
and then i got stuck on this fence with --
my -- my pant leg is --
what were you thinking ?
we both know you &apos;re not a good climber .
well , i know that .
there &apos;s a parking lot right over there .
i &apos;m parked over here .
sit right -- sit right -- sit right there .
sit right there .
okay , okay , put me down .
two , three .
you don &apos;t have to throw me .
look , i -- i get why you don &apos;t want me here .
i @-@ i know there &apos;s no such thing as bad luck ,
but there -- there is bad energy ,
and i bring a lot of that to your whole sports world .
and that &apos;s -- that &apos;s because of my own history with it
and you deserve better .
i couldn &apos;t do better . you know what ?
why can &apos;t we look at sports like one of those friends
that one of us likes and the other doesn &apos;t ?
sports can be like your mom .
you know , actually , i @-@ i didn &apos;t hate this .
oh , shut up .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i @-@ i was kind of getting into the whole football culture .
there is an elegance that this has --
no !
no ! this is vicuna !
you neanderthals !
great game , champ .
thanks .
you okay ?
yeah , just a little tired .
it was a big day . good night .
night , kid .
hey , wait a second .
your team just won six straight .
let &apos;s celebrate with a little scotch .
you &apos;re old enough for your first sip .
she dumped me , jay .
okay , we &apos;re gonna do this .
she was just using me to make her old boyfriend jealous .
now they &apos;re back together .
don &apos;t tell mom , okay ?
i had a sense she didn &apos;t like sam .
really ? she didn &apos;t say anything .
my first girlfriend .
she was perfect .
eh , a little wide in the can .
jay .
i &apos;m sorry . just ...
you ask me , you &apos;re lucky .
she dumped me by text
while making out with her old boyfriend .
i broke down crying . my charcoal ran like mascara .
i had to be comforted by the other team &apos;s mascot .
lucky ?
think about it .
how many guys your age would kill
to be used by a girl like sam ?
she picked you .
she used you .
i was a body , jay .
come on . if she had picked an average guy ,
that boyfriend never would have got jealous .
she had to pick a guy on his level .
yeah . maybe .
oh , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you .
it sucks , and sometimes
it &apos;s got to suck for a while .
i just wish i could say some magic words
or give you a hug -- make it all go away .
can i still have a sip of that scotch like you said ?
okay , i just opened a bottle ,
a beautiful 18 @-@ year @-@ old ,
full @-@ bodied .
sam !
okay . okay .
marco !
marco !
polo ?
marco !
marco !
polo ! polo ! polo !
who rings the bell in the middle of the night ?
it is the creepiest thing .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just , i don &apos;t know ,
some guy &apos;s car broke down and he wants to use our phone .
have you ever seen a movie ?
okay , do you remember how sad i was
when you guys left the hotel room ?
phil , what is on the other side of that door ?
hi , marco .
hey , guys .
it &apos;s possible they misunderstood me
when i said , &quot; you guys should stop by . &quot;
yeah , &quot; you guys should stop by . &quot;
marco !
all right .
