New York's Classic Rock Q1.04.3.
Good morning. I'm Jim Kerr.
Coming up later on the Q...
Half an hour, he says.
It's a fucking hour and a half already.
He's busy.
Enjoy the music.
I thought you weren't coming.
You don't wanna know.
Actually, I do.
We had intel
a Salafist cell was at Newark airport
boarding somebody onto a 767 to London.
You're right. I don't wanna know.
We get this all the time. Our source was either wrong
or it was done to study our response.
Happens all the time?
What's up, my friend?
You know, my kid is obsessed with this shit.
We tell him he's making a molehill out of it.
Is he right?
Hey. Probably another hour.
Just leave it out, all right?
I'll heat it up.
Well, then, don't leave it out.
What do you want me to say?
You got a rough enough job with this terrorism shit.
I'll let you get home.
The reason I called is those two Arabs I turned you on to,
well, I happened to remember
my nephew mentioned a bank
where they had an account.
A branch.
The Mintner First Merchants Bank.
You just remembered that?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Listen.
I know you got that friend in the Brooklyn office.
Is it possible he knows where Phil Leotardo is?
I want to try to avoid any more of my guys getting hurt.
I'm just saying,
if you heard anything from your pal...
I haven't.
I figured maybe money's sent to the Middle East.
You're overreaching.
OK.
See you Thursday.
Where are you going? I just got here.
I'm really late meeting Patrick in the city.
Bye.
How are you doing?
She smelled that odour too.
Your remodel will fix all that.
Maybe it's toxic. Maybe we shouldn't be breathing it.
It's not toxic. The owners were, what,
90 years old? It's piss.
I got to get home.
I'm working on it.
I went to see Sil
and Gab. Oh, my God, Tony.
Yeah.
Are you being careful?
This kind of bothers me.
Call me when you get home, OK?
OK.
Thanks.
Who is she gonna tell?
But you should use the back door.
I wouldn't kick her out of bed for purging cookies.
Real funny. We're just friends.
I know. Nice work.
She's a model.
She's doing some modelling.
She's a junior in high school.
What?
She's quitting modelling anyway.
She's tired of being exploited.
Did you help your mother put the carpets in the sun?
He did.
Uncle Bobby's funeral is finally set for Thursday.
And you're gonna be there.
How's that supposed to work?
We're all on Def-Con 4, living in separate houses,
and we'll stand in the open at a cemetery?
There is always a large FBl presence.
Unbelievable.
He was different, you know. We forget.
When he was with Blanca.
The ceremony just ended.
Every one of these things is lemon chicken or fish.
Look at that.
Can I have some sauce?
I heard cauliflower's $3.99 a pound.
I'm not gonna have this.
Can you believe that?
Pop, they got roast pork.
Give me one. Thanks.
She had won American ldol.
No.
Jennifer Hudson? Absolutely.
Jason G was the winner of ltalian-American ldol.
He could say "fuck" more times in a sentence
than any other contestant.
Uncle Paulie, come sit down.
I'll sit with you. I'm young at heart.
Who are you, dear?
Tara Zincone. Bobby's niece.
My condolences.
Did I eat!
It was good.
In the midst of death, we are in life.
Or is it the other way round?
I think the other way round.
Either version, you're halfway up the ass.
Pardon my French, sweetheart.
I've lost two dear friends.
Sil's hanging on.
I lost Ma last month.
You can take 2007 and give it back to the lndians.
I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?
Life goes on.
We were discussing Dreamgirls. Did you see it?
You people are fucked. You're living in a dream.
You still sit here talking about the fucking Oscars?
"What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
Yeets.
AJ.
Yeats?
The world...don't you see it?
Bush let Al Qaeda escape in the mountains.
Then he has us invade another country.
Let's join up, go kill some fucking terrorists.
It's more noble than watching these fantasies on TV
of how we're kicking their ass.
It's like, America...
What about it?
This is still where people come to make it.
It's a beautiful idea.
And then what do they get? Bling?
And come-ons for shit they can't afford?
I don't know what you're trying to say.
He's saying the framus intersects with the ramistan at the paternoster.
Tell you right now, it's light.
This situation ain't all bad.
I haven't had a green vegetable in over a week.
We can't even go down the pork store?
We gotta stay here doing nothing?
Baciagalup.
Who does he belong to?
He showed up during the big storm.
Caught a mouse down the cellar.
A lot of my customers giving their action to New York.
Power vacuum, they take advantage.
The fuck you come in that way for?
Sorry.
We're gonna meet Paulie down the hospital,
visit Sil. Wanna come?
No, I got shit I gotta do.
My daughter...
Yesterday it was his gout.
This is New York's famous Little ltaly.
It once covered over 40 square blocks
but has now been reduced to one row of shops and café–Ÿ.
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you? Are you close?
Let's do it over the phone.
No word yet.
No one knows where our friend is.
It's not that there's no word, it's that there's no progress.
Nobody's taking this lightly, Phil.
He should have been done first.
They thought they'd find them both at the strip joint.
I've heard this already.
I know you're disappointed, Phil.
I can hear it in everything you say.
Fucking A I'm disappointed.
I'm thinking.
I don't know. Maybe...
We can't go back. Are you out of your fucking mind?
No, I know.
Then what did you say it for?
I didn't, Phil. You did.
Listen, kid,
when this is over we're gonna sit down,
me and you.
I hope so.
I can't hear you. You're breaking up.
I said I hope...
Ferrara's.
Want a pastry?
I need to watch my weight.
I need to snag another husband.
You're the only one who realised that's a joke.
You had to grow up in our family.
That dig you made about me giving guys head under the boardwalk?
He took it so seriously, Bobby.
Anyway,
thank you for being here.
So what happens now?
Robert's already said he wants to go live with his aunt.
What about Sophia?
Nica is my daughter.
She's very much into her older sister.
Sophia's out of her mind if she thinks she's getting out of this house.
Is that a joke? Cos that one even got by me.
You know, five, six years ago
when Johnny Sack bought this house,
this was all cornfields here.
I'd like to give it a shot with Bobby's kids.
Bobby would want it.
I put in a lot of effort with Sophia, baking together.
I think we actually have a bond.
I had therapy. I'm a good mother.
I put Ma and all her warped shit behind me.
Good.
Not that I get any thanks for it.
You know, you could form a new nuclear family.
You bring Harpo down here...
It's a big place.
Harpo changed his name.
He's Hal now.
Janice...
You need anything, you know I'm minutes away.
Yeah.
Multiple calls
traced back to a payphone in Oyster Bay, Long lsland.
What?
Where's the phone at exactly?
Gas station, most likely.
Gas station?
He's lammed out.
He may not be able to get a clean cellphone.
Listen, thanks. Really...
All right.
You kept telling me this guy is good.
It's amazing it was written so long ago.
It's, like, about right now.
This could be a mistake.
I know.
We're good friends.
Yeah.
Wait.
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.
Go!
Oh, Christ. I parked in leaves.
At least my gas tank was practically empty.
How many fucking times have I told you?
It's an SUV! Watch where you park off road!
The catalytic converter and the dry vegetation.
I didn't see the leaves.
You can grill steaks on that converter.
I told you.
If there was children playing in those leaves,
you'd have run them over?
I guess.
You gonna get cute now?
I was just answering her question.
Dad, he wasn't being funny.
You mind your own goddamn business unless you want some of this too.
Mr Fat Mouth.
What did you say?
What was going through your mind?
What do you want from me? I am depressed.
I'm supposed to go round looking for piles of leaves?
Wanna hear depressed? $30,000 for that car.
Isn't that what you have insurance for?
Excuse me? You're not getting another one.
Actually, that's good.
lt'll force me to take the bus.
What?
We have to break our dependence on foreign oil.
Caf?Napoli.
George, it's Anthony.
Your fucking ears must be ringing.
I just left your friend, the son, crying the blues
over the situation between you and that outfit.
That's why I'm calling.
I need you to reach out to the little guy.
He's not happy with Phil neither.
I know.
You're not part of that family.
You're basically retired. Everybody trusts you.
What I'm thinking, you'd supply a neutral location,
guarantee everybody's safety.
I could do that.
Hi, George.
Hey.
They're here. They've been patted down too.
Anybody want a water?
No.
No.
We started it? We got a dead goomah in Queens
and her old Ukrainian father.
I'm not even gonna blame Phil.
John Sacrimoni, my friend,
I'm sorry to say, was an insecure guy.
He created a constant tension
within his own family which spilled over.
Go ahead, Carmine.
George was good enough to broker this meeting. You just gonna sit there?
It didn't have to be this way.
We agree. It's gone too far.
Phil, I don't know... he's changed.
You got my word. We'll back off.
My price is you help us get a location on Phil.
I can't go there.
But you do what you gotta do.
One more thing. You hit my brother-in-law.
So?
This is my sister we're talking about.
She's gotta see something out of this.
We'll come up with a number.
Look at all this mail.
Anybody need some barbers' scissors?
Tone?
Put some next to my coat.
He was at the safe house. We brought him over.
Get him the fuck out.
These are snakes with fur.
The old ltalians will tell you
you can't even put them around a baby.
They suck the breath right out.
You're the only baby here so we're ahead of the game.
You wanna be wearing his pelt on your head?
I said get rid of him.
Leave him.
He's a good guy.
No payphone.
Look, there's a double-breasted robin.
It doesn't cost anything to be polite.
That goes two ways, ma'am.
Pat, how are you?
Hi.
Livia.
I'm Janice, her daughter.
What did he say? I can't...
Uncle Jun',
I wanna show you something.
Bobby and my baby.
Janice.
No, I'm Janice.
That's my little girl. Her name's Domenica.
Sweet as she looks, she left my stove on on purpose,
put the flame out with a wet dishrag.
I caught her.
Uncle Jun',
I'm afraid I have bad news.
Bobby's dead.
The Ambassador Hotel.
Your Bobby. Bobby Baccalieri.
I'm a widow now.
She was inveigling him.
She's after his money.
You're not even curious about him?
He can fucking rot.
When you were an inpatient
you said you might try and get a job.
I can't now because of the car.
I need to get a bus schedule.
The thing is,
ever since it blew up
I feel, like...
cleansed or something.
Because
it was a polluter?
No.
I mean, just watching it go,
that huge fireball...
You have no idea. The heat...
My seat melted.
I had been in it just a few seconds before.
Carlo.
Yeah.
T, I had a meeting down here with Carlo this morning.
We were supposed to go see Butch and them on a couple of items.
Carlo didn't show.
And he don't answer his phones neither.
I'll call you back on the prepay.
Yeah.
What are you thinking?
That maybe we were had.
That this Butch has taken out another ranking guy.
T?
What if he flipped?
Who? Carlo?
Well?
You there?
His kid, the imbecile...
Jason. He got picked up yesterday,
Patsy told me, for selling Ecstasy.
Mead', they're gonna be here...
Miss Hunter! Long time no see.
How are you, Mrs Soprano?
Oh, my God, when was it?
It was around when you quit college.
You're being kind. I was kicked out for partying and drunk driving.
Well, I didn't want to say, but...
Well, that was always you.
What are you up to now?
I'm in my second year of med school.
Yeah,
I completed undergrad at Purchase,
got my act together.
Yes. They're gonna be here, Meadow.
A man took his horse to a vet
and the vet says to him, "Why do you have a long face?"
A horse goes. There's no man.
Right. A horse goes to a vet.
The vet looks at his face and he says to him,
"My friend...
A horse goes to the doctor.
The doctor says, "Why the long face?"
Can't tell jokes.
More pinot grig', Patrick?
No, thanks.
Speaking of jokers, where's that other son of yours today?
I didn't think he was invited.
I just thought with all the wedding talk...
No, really, that pal of his, the other Jason,
I heard he ran into some trouble.
Carlo's Jason.
He's a mess.
All right.
He's got no shortage of lawyers here.
Tone, Patsy needs a refill.
No, Tone, I'll...
Sit down.
This one here would only take the case for free.
That's why we want her at Grubman,
Grubman & Curcio.
Mead' and I have had some conversations
and we may still snag her at the firm
when she's done with law school.
No kidding?
We went out to dinner with Steven Grubman and the subject came up.
Steven was impressed with her work at the Poverty Law Centre.
He even got into starting salaries. He was talking 1.70.
Jesus. Sweetheart, that's fantastic.
He had had too much Gevrey.
Don't devalue yourself.
We've got a real interesting case right now.
We're defending James Trefoglio
on those corruption charges.
Is that your case, honey?
Bid rigging. It's got bagmen, whores,
it's fascinating.
Yeah, he does that,
sometimes most of the day, stares at Chrissy's picture.
The fuck?
You know, they're funny that way.
I had an aunt, her cat would only sit
at the exact corners of the table, staring out,
or at the intersection of two walls, staring in.
This fucking animal is history today.
Pick him up.
You pick him up.
T, you see this shit?
Does it all the time, he says.
Yeah?
Look at him staring at that dead kid.
Gives me the fucking creeps.
Walden, give us some privacy.
Yeah.
Walden. What the fuck kind of name is that for an ltalian?
I was named after Mr Bobby Darin, Walden Robert Cassotto.
The Cifaretto crew, it's a fucking Chinese fire drill over there,
especially now Carlo is absent.
I know.
I want you to skipper that thing.
Really?
Fucking thing is one big ATM machine.
All our construction with New York folds right into your kick.
Yeah.
Jesus, I thought you'd be pleased.
I didn't hand you a diagnosis of the clap.
With due respect, I'd like to just mull it a little.
I'm no spring chicken no more.
I don't want to die on you, leaving you worse off than before.
You with the dead thing.
You got the arms and upper body of a 20-year-old.
I gotta work at that.
And I had the prostate.
All right, sure.
Go ahead.
I'm a little miffled but yeah, sit with it.
Thanks, T. This means everything,
your faith in me.
In the line of duty.
But we're short-handed.
Anyway, mid-'60s, probably used the payphones.
We don't have payphones.
Just a couple of stations have them now.
Get in.
Activity, that's good.
I can already see a difference.
Yeah.
Gotta get back at it myself.
Listen.
I'm gonna join the army.
What?
Did you sign any shit?
No, but this week I will.
I gotta deal with Rhiannon first.
Rhiannon? What about your mother?
Her too.
Are you nuts?
You wanna get sent to lraq?
Afghanistan.
It's probably good for my career.
You don't have a career.
My ultimate goal is
to qualify for helicopter pilot training,
afterwards go to work for Trump or somebody,
be their personal pilot.
I'm not even gonna tell your mother about this.
And don't you do nothing
until we've had another chance to talk.
You hear me?
Yes.
He's gonna join the fucking army.
I gotta be frank,
you people got him out of his room, great,
so he can be cannon fodder?
I wasn't aware of this latest plan.
Sorry.
I should have gone before we left the house.
Still on the army thing.
On the other hand, I'm thinking he could benefit
from the training, the discipline.
Maybe the army'd be great for him
if there wasn't a war going on.
I didn't tell you, he spent $200
on a set of CDs that teach Arabic.
Jesus Christ, come on. Shish kebab, what else do you need to know?
He used to just veg in front of that TV.
He says he wants to get past the hate,
focus it only on the terrorists.
I really can't reveal much more.
Right. Even though we're paying.
This whole therapy thing, I gotta tell you...
What?
My mother was a borderline personality.
So what?
I don't know if you knew that.
No.
I did not have a very happy childhood.
No?
There was little love in the house.
He's mentioned your mother briefly.
A very difficult woman,
undermining.
I tried to place her in a retirement community
for her own good.
She turned on me completely.
You see, I never could please my mother.
To what do I owe this chance to go sake bombing?
We used to have dinner all the time.
You're gonna get married and my chances are flying by me.
So, your brother,
our little soldier boy,
what do you think is wrong with that googootz?
The world is a sad, fucked-up place.
If there's so much suffering,
why did you go off the paediatrician bit?
We talked about that.
You said you wanted to be a lawyer for black people.
That's all I said? Really?
What I said was the state can crush the individual.
New Jersey?
The government.
Specifically the federal government.
And what about little babies
in the face of meningitis?
You know what really turned me?
Seeing the way ltalians are treated.
It's like Mom says. If we can have our rights trampled like that,
imagine what it's like for recent arrivals.
If I hadn't seen you
dragged away all those times by the FBl
then I'd probably be a boring suburban doctor.
Bye-bye.
Wave bye-bye, Grandpa.
Bye-bye, Pop-pop.
Say bye-bye.
I gotta make a phone call.
I'll meet you at the drugstore.
Tell the goddamn pharmacist to call Dr laconis.
I should get a 60-day supply of the Plavix.
Phil!
Oh, my God!
Phil!
Oh, my God!
Help me! Oh,
my God!
My babies! Somebody help!
Help me! The babies!
Somebody help me.
Help me, please.
Oh, God, they're locked in there.
Oh, shit!
Seen Metro News?
No.
Your own beat. Phil Leotardo got popped.
Damn. We're gonna win this thing.
OK,
as your parents we don't feel
joining the army is in your best interest.
This country is in a crisis.
How can one soldier stop it?
When my enlistment's up,
I could join the ClA or something.
With a military background I'd have a leg-up.
As an Arabic speaker I'd be really useful.
You're gonna ask the Donald
for some time off from your pilot job to go on ClA missions?
Everything's a joke to you.
I'm not having a good time.
Did you or did you not want me to go to military school?
But I started to cry.
At least you'd have come out an officer.
Even then I was opposed to it.
I hate this idea.
I'm applying for Officer Candidate School.
I want to be a liaison officer
with the local population anyway.
Officer Candidate School?
You have terrible grades. You flunked out of college.
Here we go. That's all this is about, right?
No, that's not what this is all about.
You don't want to go to college, don't go,
but don't get your legs blown off.
Always with the drama.
So what does your girlfriend say, the fashion model?
She doesn't think I should go either.
Well?
Not that long ago you talked about owning a club.
You had a problem with that too.
A lot of your friends are in film school, you say,
especially the ones you used to go to the clubs with.
So I got this screenplay from Danny Baldwin.
We met at your cousin's movie.
Danny hoped I'd set him up with some financing,
but I never read it.
Well, you did now.
Yeah, I did now
and it's about a private detective
that gets sucked into the internet through his data port.
And he's gotta solve
some murders and some virtual prostitutes.
I read it. It's scary.
I talked to Little Carmine
and he wants to develop it through his company.
He does porn.
He did Cleaver. He's branching out.
You would work for his producer, lnge.
You would be, what is the word?
Development executive on this project.
Really?
What's this got to do with clubs?
Hollywood and gossip columns, the nightspots...
You get some real-world experience under your belt,
you come see me
and we will talk about me investing in a club.
Run that past Rahoony, see what she says.
Somebody's giving grand jury testimony on something.
So Carlo has flipped.
We don't know.
And subpoenas are flying.
My hunch...
80 to 90% chance you'll be indicted.
That fucking gun charge,
I get sick when I think of it,
plus interstate fraud and, if Carlo starts talking, homicide...
Give me the fucking thing.
Not like we haven't envisioned this day.
No, it's not.
Look, trials are there to be won.
So?
With all due respect, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart,
I'm gonna pass.
I don't fucking believe this.
Why?
Every guy who ran that crew died prematurely.
Come on.
I beat cancer once.
You've no idea what that does to you.
I know, but Jesus...
Richie Aprile, Ralphie MlA, Vito,
and who knows what with Carlo, Gigi...
Gigi died taking a shit.
Doesn't mean it's not part of an overall pattern.
Are you gonna deny yourself life-changing money,
a package to leave your niece who has MS?
It's like your bullshit with the cat.
The fucking animal catches mice for us
but you'd drown it.
I would.
He's not looking at Christopher.
A rat died in the wall back there or some shit.
I moved the picture. The fucking thing
came to the new spot and stared.
It's the abstract shapes or something.
Tell you this,
since he's dead,
my gambling luck's done a 180.
OK.
It's fine for you to believe that shit,
but I can't worry about a jinx?
Tone, I never told this to another living soul, but...
Yeah?
One time at the Bing,
I was alone to meet Eddy Lind,
I saw the Virgin Mary.
Why didn't you say something?
Fuck strippers, we could have had a shrine,
sold holy water in gallon jugs.
Could have made billions.
I tell you something deep in my heart and you laugh it off?
I'm not saying there's nothing out there,
but to not live your life? What the fuck are you gonna do?
You don't want the job, you don't want the job.
I can put Patsy in there.
He's gonna be part of my family now.
It'll be good.
Prick.
You always know what to say to me, don't you?
No, I'm serious.
I live but to serve you, my liege.
Well, they had to get it for me.
There's no real public transport out here.
But I said no more SUV.
Well, that's the cool part,
23 highway. It's not so bad.
Hey.
Listen, we're not eating at home tonight.
I thought we'd go to Holsten's.
You said we'd have manigott'.
I got meetings with carpenters.
Holsten's is the consensus.
I gotta see some people. I'll meet you there.
Sir.
Sir, excuse me.
Hello.
What, you don't recognise me?
We used to play catch.
You don't remember that you shot me?
Enough with the fucking birds.
I'm Anthony, Johnny's son.
Fuck you want, a boutonniere?
All right, listen to me. Uncle Pat came to see me
about Janice, about your money.
People keep asking me. I don't know.
There's a man from another galaxy that came here.
That's your accountant.
I'm confused.
Any money should go to Bobby Baccala's kids.
Now, Janice may not do that, but Bobby was with us.
He's a made guy. Wouldn't be right.
Me, I never had kids.
You remember where your stash is, you let Uncle Pat know.
Me as the head of the family,
I'll hold on to it as a guardian, for Bobby's kids.
You remember Bobby?
Sure.
You don't know who I am, do you?
Remember Johnny,
Johnny boy, your kid brother?
"This thing of ours.
I was involved with that?
You and my dad.
You two ran North Jersey.
We did?
Yeah.
Well, that's nice.
Hey. - Hey.
What looks good tonight?
I don't know.
Where's googootz?
He just called. He's on his way.
Mead's coming separately. She had to go to the doctor.
Switch birth control.
Did you talk to Mink again?
It's Carlo. He's gonna testify.
Onion rings.
Best in the state as far as I'm concerned.
Shit.
How was work today?
All I'm doing is getting coffee and placing phone calls.
You may not realise it but you are making contacts.
It's an entry-level job.
So buck up.
Right, focus on the good times.
Don't be sarcastic.
Isn't that what you said?
"Try to remember the times that were good.
I did?
Yeah.
Well, it's true, I guess.
