to our best and final score .
what is it ?
part of the original german u @-@ boat manifest .
you still think caffrey has the art ?
i don &apos;t know .
agent kramer is sorry he can &apos;t be here in person ,
but he briefed me fully .
he did ?
chris gates .
you &apos;re interpol ?
yeah . so it &apos;s a partial list .
most of what was on the sub is still unaccounted for .
they only found one page .
if anyone tries to sell anything that &apos;s on that list ,
we &apos;re gonna nail &apos; em .
yes , we are .
did you find the safe ?
the manifest wasn &apos;t in there , moz . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s open season on keller . spoils go to the victor .
a $ 6 @-@ million bounty .
that &apos;s roughly the black @-@ market sale price of the degas .
no . that &apos;s the exact sale price of the degas .
it &apos;s on the list , moz !
you lied to me ?
when the degas turns up -- and it will --
the fbi is gonna know the treasure didn &apos;t burn .
and we &apos;re the prime suspects .
the sparrow dies at midnight .
then i &apos;d hate to be the sparrow .
seriously ?
i was about to expose the leader of the north american union .
nope . you just thought you were .
the n.a.u. doesn &apos;t exist .
says you . you set this up ?
i had to talk to you somehow .
another piece of fiction .
much like the yarn you spun
about not having the fbi &apos;s art manifest .
you have a right to be angry . i lied to you .
why ?
i broke into peter &apos;s safe .
i had the list in my hand .
i was ready to take the treasure and go .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
peter cal--
i have a life here .
but we had a dream .
well , dreams change .
i mean , have you ever thought
we might not like whiling away our days
on a mediterranean island ?
then we sell our island and come back .
no , you can come back . i can &apos;t .
i run on this ,
and new york is just a memory for me .
come on , neal .
this was the one --
the perfect last score .
i knew you were dragging your feet .
you went behind my back and fenced the degas .
i did it to --
i did it to protect us .
by putting a hit on keller ?
doing something that rash
is exactly what will get us into trouble .
most black @-@ market pieces never resurface .
you know that .
because they &apos;re not on a list
that peter is actively looking for .
the degas is . if peter finds it --
yeah , i know .
and it proves that the treasure didn &apos;t burn ,
and the trail leads straight back to us .
so let &apos;s stop the bleeding . who &apos;s the fence ?
rusty .
rusty ? seriously ?
all right , talk to him .
find out who he sold the painting to .
we &apos;ll start there .
fine .
talk to rusty , okay ?
but that does leave one question .
do you want to stay ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
the greatest way to live honorably
is to be what we pretend to be .
i &apos;m paraphrasing ,
but i don &apos;t think old socrates here would mind .
he might . can i help you ?
yeah .
you know anything about renaissance portrait medals ?
you seem to know that i do .
i have a cold case on a fiorentino
that was taken from the smithsonian 8 years ago .
the one i found turned out
to be chocolate , wrapped in foil .
you probably heard that story .
sounds vaguely familiar .
i thought it might .
i &apos;m -- - agent kramer ,
head of the bureau &apos;s d.c. art crimes unit .
i &apos;d say this moment was inevitable , mr. caffrey ,
given i am who i am , and you are who you are .
oh , good . you two have met .
oh , neal and i were , uh ...
well , what were we doing here ?
shooting the breeze .
yeah . yeah , you could say that .
agent kramer was my mentor at quantico .
now i &apos;m a just a friend .
so you &apos;re the one who taught peter everything he knows .
well , i taught him a fair amount .
kept a few things for myself .
oh , now , you didn &apos;t tell me that .
what brings d.c. to new york ?
you tell him ?
why don &apos;t we take this into the conference room ?
all right .
two days ago , we got a tip
that a long @-@ lost masterpiece surfaced in new york .
you all know agent kramer from d.c.
one of our c.i.s heard chatter
of a black @-@ market painting being sold here .
a degas .
good eye , jones .
this one &apos;s called &quot; entrance of the masked dancers . &quot;
it was compl--
oh , neal , i &apos;m sure you can take it from here .
oh , completed in 1884,
it &apos;s one of degas &apos; seminal works .
it &apos;s more complex than the gauzy ballerinas he &apos;s famous for .
it &apos;s believed to have been taken by the germans in &apos; 41
from the tsarskoye selo museum in saint petersburg ,
along with a whole lot of other art .
it hasn &apos;t been seen since .
what do you think , neal ?
me ?
i think recovering this masterpiece
would be incredible , sir .
me too .
so we &apos;re gonna find it .
hey , moz , did you talk to rusty ?
i left word . he hasn &apos;t returned .
relax . he goes up to the poconos .
the fbi knows about the degas .
our degas ?
well , as much as it ever was .
we have to find rusty ,
make sure he keeps our names out of this .
oh , the hypothetical becomes the reality .
well , how &apos;s this for reality ?
agent kramer is in town from d.c. , lending peter a hand .
really ?
what &apos;s the eminence grise of the art crimes unit like ?
take peter , add years of experience
and less inclination to cut us slack .
my blood just ran cold .
supposedly he has an encyclopedic knowledge
of the impressionists .
well , he knows enough about our degas
to scare the hell out of me .
please tell me he didn &apos;t bring his girl friday with him .
no , we caught a break . agent matthews isn &apos;t with him .
a break , indeed . i don &apos;t
know how you would have gotten out of that .
well , let &apos;s focus on getting out of this .
we need to stop peter from finding that painting .
what do you have in mind ?
locate the degas and get it back .
why is there a giant hourglass on my table ?
somewhere along the line , i think your motives got blurred .
keeping the treasure here
was never part of the long @-@ term plan .
moz , this is not -- - 48 hours .
in that time , i will do anything you think we need to do
in order to leave .
and when time runs out ?
lolana and i
are taking the treasure and leaving ...
regardless of the list , the degas , or the fbi .
i hope you &apos;ll come with us .
you &apos;re giving me an ultimatum .
yes , i am .
stay here with peter or come with me .
choose a side , neal .
yeah , that was an interesting one .
we pulled the wire con on a mob boss .
another average day
in the new york white collar office .
don &apos;t laugh . it &apos;s not far off .
what happened to the stoic , no @-@ nonsense probie
we called the archeologist ?
the archeologist ?
yeah , he &apos;d never stop digging .
i &apos;m still stoic .
well , neal &apos;s loosened you up a little bit .
not true .
i can see that .
but in a good way .
hey , our closure rate is unprecedented .
they know about you boys in d.c.
lot of water @-@ cooler talk
about gotham city &apos;s finest cop and robber .
you took this right here in the kitchen .
yeah . yeah . neal is my c.i. , and he &apos;s --
he &apos;s also a friend .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna go put a pot of coffee on ,
and i &apos;ll let you guys talk , okay ?
you &apos;re awful close to the guy you think stole the degas .
it &apos;s that obvious ?
well , today you had a roomful of people
ready to go after that painting ,
and you looked at only one man .
you think he stole the treasure ?
i have my suspicions .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
i need an outside perspective .
hey , before i met you ,
i had a c.i. who used to throw batting practice
for my son &apos;s little league team .
and now ?
now i get the occasional e @-@ mail from prison .
these are short @-@ term relationships , peter , at best .
it &apos;s hardwired in their brains .
you think once a con , always a con ?
i think recidivism rates paint a bleak picture .
you have to protect yourself when they fall .
i know . my career &apos;s at risk .
no , i &apos;m not talking about your job .
i &apos;m talking about you .
when this happens ,
you &apos;re not slapping cuffs on a criminal .
you &apos;re taking down a friend .
it hurts .
people can change .
pete ...
you asked me for my help .
if neal is a suspect ...
he is .
... then you have to treat him like one .
neal , we need your expertise .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m here for .
great .
let &apos;s say that you &apos;re in possession
of a masterpiece that disappeared 70 years ago .
like a degas ?
exactly .
you can imagine that , right , neal ?
enjoying the fantasy as we speak , sir .
too bad it can &apos;t last .
why not ?
because the painting &apos;s hot . you have to get rid of it .
or the feds will take me down ?
exactly .
you need to take that ?
nope .
so i &apos;ve got a hot degas i need to move
before you take me down .
question is , how do you fence it ?
i don &apos;t . i &apos;d have someone fence it for me .
why go through a middleman ?
a degas appearing after all this time
is going to be greeted with a healthy amount of skepticism .
people will assume it &apos;s a forgery .
yeah , they usually are .
so i &apos;d need someone with
an impeccable reputation to make the sale .
you want me to ask around ?
actually , kramer &apos;s team already has two suspects in mind .
thorough .
this is gus leland .
deals exclusively in french impressionists ,
recently returned to new york .
i know gus . he always has quality work .
he definitely fits the bill .
second guy is known as rusty .
renowned for an impeccable eye at spotting forgeries .
yeah , he &apos;s suspected of brokering the black @-@ market sale
of matisse &apos;s &quot; la pastorale &quot; last year .
yeah .
and it &apos;s also rumored
he recently sold a high @-@ priority painting here .
mm . tell me , neal ,
when you fence your degas ,
who are you gonna use ?
rusty &apos;s got the local contacts .
i &apos;d go with rusty .
then that &apos;s who we &apos;ll go after .
okay . my team has gus .
good luck , gentlemen .
all right , i &apos;ll call mozzie .
he keeps tabs on gotham &apos;s black @-@ market elite .
no need .
we &apos;ve had eyes on rusty for 24 hours .
we know exactly where he is .
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s walk .
don &apos;t we need a car to pick up rusty ?
i got a few in place .
need to reach out and touch someone ?
i find it a handy tool
to keep abreast in this fast @-@ paced world .
no one ever talks anymore . put that away .
let &apos;s talk .
okay .
tell me why kramer &apos;s really here .
he &apos;s a friend and he &apos;s a mentor .
he &apos;s a watchdog .
is that what you think a mentor is ?
let &apos;s see -- as depicted in homer &apos;s &quot; odyssey , &quot;
mentor was half @-@ man , half @-@ god .
he represented the union
of path and goal , if i recall .
wisdom personified .
that &apos;s one interpretation .
mentor also guided odysseus &apos; son during the trojan war .
you planning to go to war , peter ?
oh , not yet .
but if i have to ,
kramer &apos;s got my back .
must be nice having someone who believes in you .
i never gave him a reason not to .
rusty !
what &apos;s this about ?
you already have a new piece to sell ?
you asked to meet in plain sight .
could you pick somewhere more public ?
and your hair &apos;s like a freaking flare .
this is genetics . that shirt is a choice .
why are we here ?
this is about the last piece i sold .
where is it ?
questioning my professional discretion ?
i &apos;m insulted .
rusty , i need it back .
well , that &apos;s a different conversation .
i can talk to the guy , see if he &apos;d be willing
to part with it for , say , a 30 % profit ?
this is an emergency .
do you know how this works ?
i &apos;m a middleman .
i give you the name ,
you cut me out the next time .
my entire job is dependent
on me not telling you that information .
the fbi is looking for that painting .
now you &apos;re trying to scare me into helping you ? sad .
not sad .
urgent ! the feds are here !
really , mozzie ?
going with the old , tired &quot; g @-@ men are after me &quot; bit ?
rusty , stay where you are ! rusty !
diana , tell backup to come around to bryant park .
hey , look out !
all right , i &apos;ll take left , you take right ?
peter ?
go .
such a hurry !
why &apos;d you bring the suit ?
look , the fbi has been monitoring rusty .
peter didn &apos;t give me a chance to warn you .
did you get the info ?
rusty didn &apos;t tell me anything .
on the upside , i &apos;m assuming he won &apos;t tell the fbi , either .
all right , good . i &apos;ll head him off .
what ? no ! let him go !
peter is gunning for me , moz .
if i help him catch rusty ,
maybe he &apos;ll ease up on his leash .
now get out of here before he sees you .
hold on . rusty &apos;s phone .
i deleted any references to us .
perfect . thank you , moz .
diana , where are my guys ?
this exit &apos;s closed .
rusty ...
we need to talk about a man and a degas .
got to love good old @-@ fashioned teamwork .
he screamed for his lawyer the second i put cuffs on him .
he knows talking will kill his reputation .
we need leverage .
you have it . found rusty &apos;s phone .
he must have tossed it .
his recent call list
should help us figure out where he got the degas .
we &apos;ll get this to e.r.t.
meet you back at the office . we &apos;ll go over details .
sounds good .
your boy is very helpful for our lead suspect .
so it seems .
excuse me ! hold the elevator please !
thank you .
chris . chris gates .
agent matthews .
please . you can call me melissa after last time .
sorry . melissa . how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
good .
i didn &apos;t know they &apos;d pulled in interpol for this .
well , here i am .
on your way to see agent burke ?
yes .
yes . we &apos;ll go together .
fan ... tastic .
i assume you &apos;re here about the degas ?
i only know what kramer tells me .
can i trust you ? - what &apos;s wrong ?
melissa ...
can i trust you ? - try me .
what i am about to say ...
damn it . you &apos;re not authorized .
authorized for what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . there &apos;s no time .
there is a mole in the white collar division
here in new york .
what ?
we intercepted an unidentified transmission from this office .
someone here is trying to make a play for the sub &apos;s stolen art .
and they &apos;ve sent interpol in to investigate ?
yes . i &apos;m on special assignment . no one here can be trusted .
as far as this office is concerned ,
i &apos;m a recovery consultant on loan to the bureau .
but the night we had drinks --
i was careless , all right ? i let my cover slip .
i &apos;m sorry i got you mixed up in this .
chris --
call me &quot; neal . &quot; please .
i definitely don &apos;t regret the drinks , though .
agent matthews . thanks for making the trip .
of course . that &apos;s the job .
i have everything that agent kramer requested .
great . i see you &apos;ve met neal .
yeah . yes , neal and i
had a very interesting conversation on the ride up .
he &apos;s always good for that .
you were right .
the numbers on rusty &apos;s cell gave us a lead .
glad i could help .
agent kramer &apos;s in the conference room . come on up .
i owe you another martini .
it looks like rusty deleted several numbers from his phone
before neal found it .
unfortunately , we don &apos;t know who he bought the degas from .
but if we find it , we &apos;ll have leverage
to make him tell us where he got it .
yep .
the good news is , we think we know who he sold it to .
there were several calls placed to this man .
that &apos;s elliott richmond .
he &apos;s a black @-@ market arms trafficker .
rumor is he made a fortune moving m240s .
a fortune he spends on art .
he &apos;s got a soft spot for impressionists .
art is currency for guys like this .
over the past decade , a majority of black @-@ market dealers
stopped trading in cash .
too easy to trace , too unwieldy .
instead of carrying duffel bags with millions in bank notes --
it &apos;s easier to trade a single piece of art worth the same amount .
neal , rumor is
you &apos;ve had some experience in this payment process .
well , details are sensitive ,
but the thief in mind allegedly traded a manet
for a batch of stolen identities .
it was a tough assignment .
assignment ?
yeah , the wesley godfrey cover was blown .
what &apos;s our angle on richmond ?
richmond keeps a penthouse at 75 wall .
he doesn &apos;t own any other property in the city ,
and he loves to look at his art ,
so it &apos;s a good bet this is where he &apos;s keeping the degas .
we &apos;ve already set up a buy with him .
melissa , if you &apos;d be so kind .
two years ago , i recovered this
while working a case in germany .
this is an mp5k modified to shoot through a briefcase .
very rare . civilians can &apos;t get their hands on them .
we &apos;ve told richmond that if he likes what he sees ,
i can get him a couple hundred .
that should be enough to negotiate for a degas .
you &apos;re going in ? - i &apos;m gonna pose as the seller ,
and diana will be my backup .
diana ?
you hate guns , and as we can all see , diana ...
kind of love &apos; em .
so i &apos;m sitting this one out ?
not exactly .
you &apos;ll be in the van ...
with me .
hk mp5 in a briefcase .
classic .
trigger &apos;s in the handle .
it &apos;ll fire through the briefcase shell while you &apos;re walking .
very nice . how many have you got ?
two gross , but this will cost you . it &apos;s a rare item .
oh , i understand that .
what i don &apos;t understand is what she &apos;s doing here .
she assists me .
can &apos;t the lady speak for herself ?
the lady is also his muscle .
you &apos;re funny .
let &apos;s talk .
agent berrigan seems impressive .
almost as impressive as peter .
if there &apos;s one sure thing about peter ,
he accomplishes what he puts his mind to .
if he &apos;s got a target , he &apos;ll keep pursuing till he hits it ...
dead @-@ center .
i &apos;ll tell you what --
you bring me a gross , and you &apos;ve got yourself a deal .
done . but i don &apos;t do cash or check .
neither do i.
i have got a recently acquired and very valuable item
that is worthy of these guns --
financially speaking , of course .
what kind of item ?
what happened ?
maybe peter doesn &apos;t consider you
as much of a partner as you think .
tomorrow . 1 : 00 sharp .
you bring the guns . i &apos;ll bring the item .
until tomorrow .
must be hard to do your job when you &apos;re kept out of the loop .
you seem to know something about that , huh ?
what happened today ?
your watch cut out .
equipment malfunctions . it happens .
you know that better than anyone .
so you &apos;re not gonna tell me everything , huh ?
i &apos;m following my leads .
if you don &apos;t like where they go , too bad .
that &apos;s kramer talking .
he &apos;s the devil on your shoulder . - no .
he &apos;s reminding me why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m helping this investigation .
do you remember what you said to me
the day i first accused you of stealing the art ?
what was it , neal ?
&quot; prove it . &quot;
be careful what you wish for .
then good luck .
melissa .
you dropped something .
i &apos;ll get it .
guess kramer brought you in the loop after all , huh ?
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
why , yes , i do own these villas .
what &apos;s that ? the island ?
yeah . i kind of own that , too .
sure , i can show you coral reef ...
in my submersible .
we got a problem .
we should maybe copyright that phrase .
peter put in an op order to search richmond &apos;s home
tomorrow at 1 : 00 .
we need to get there before the feds .
meet at my place tonight .
looking sharp , there , mozzie .
keller ...
quelle surprise .
you &apos;re a hard man to track down .
you should know i always have an escape route .
five paces to my left is the &quot; a &quot; train .
to my right is jerry ,
a noble hot @-@ dog vendor who would gladly risk his life for mine .
looks to me there &apos;s only one major exit
you &apos;re concerned with , given these fancy shirts , here .
you almost killed me , mozzie . hmm ?
you put a price on my head .
which means all i have to do is scream
and new york closes in to take you down .
you scream , i gut you like a carp ,
then hop the &quot; a &quot; train five paces to your left .
jerry would never let you get that far .
you &apos;re bold , mozzie , i &apos;ll give you that .
you make the kind of ruthless choices
that caffrey never would .
what do you want , keller ?
you know what i want . i &apos;m here as a courtesy ...
which means this is your last chance
to cut me in on your treasure .
even if i knew what you were talking about ,
the answer would still be no .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
remember , i did ask nicely .
now i &apos;m gonna have to make you give me what i want .
how ?
why ruin the surprise ?
enjoy .
you &apos;d think that thing had sports scores on it .
i &apos;m looking at neal &apos;s tracking data .
is that what you &apos;ve been doing for the last hour ?
i need to know where he is .
honey , it &apos;s almost 10 : 00 on a monday .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going anywhere .
yeah , i can &apos;t be too sure ... not now .
all goes well , we &apos;ll recover the painting tomorrow .
then what ?
then i &apos;ll know the truth .
neal really did it , didn &apos;t he ?
what &apos;s got you suddenly so convinced ?
you .
the last time you obsessed this much ,
you caught him .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
you &apos;re right -- we should copyright that phrase .
keller &apos;s back .
and he wants our treasure .
what ?
he &apos;s got the entire u.s. government
and half the criminal underworld looking for him .
exactly , and if he &apos;s sticking around ,
it means he &apos;s planning to do something big .
so we should split before that happens .
no , we worry about keller
after our degas problem is handled .
i &apos;m almost done with the forgery .
48 hours , moz . let &apos;s make them count .
you &apos;ve already got a plan .
we &apos;ll have a 10 @-@ minute window during the fbi raid
to swap the painting .
i &apos;m sorry . i assumed you had a good plan .
with peter on my back , this is the only way .
okay , then . proceed .
all right , this is the layout for richmond &apos;s apartment .
he &apos;s the penthouse , 43rd floor ,
accessible by two elevators and the fire stairs .
inside , richmond &apos;s got a personal arsenal ,
so we have to tread carefully .
take him down quickly
so he doesn &apos;t have a chance to grab a weapon .
richmond thinks we &apos;re there to deal .
diana , you &apos;ll ride up with me .
jones , your team has the stairwell .
wow . 43 floors . lucky i do cardio .
what are you doing with caffrey ?
i want to know where he is at all times ,
so he &apos;s coming with me .
if peter &apos;s planning on taking you up to richmond &apos;s ,
how is this gonna work ?
he won &apos;t be taking me up .
there &apos;s a holding room right next to the guard &apos;s desk .
i &apos;ll make sure peter locks me in there
before going up to richmond &apos;s .
it &apos;s a clear shot from there to the elevators .
you &apos;ll need padded shoes .
and your elevator @-@ override box .
okay .
it &apos;ll buy me time to hit richmond
before peter gets there ?
that &apos;s all it &apos;s gonna buy you .
they &apos;ll be on the stairs .
you &apos;ll need another way down .
i know .
uh , there is no other way down .
i know .
you &apos;re keeping neal close while you go in for the degas ?
i want to watch his expression
when he sees the painting in my hand .
any chance he goes for the place tonight ?
no , i &apos;ve got a team monitoring his tracking data .
that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not planning something .
i &apos;m sure he is .
how are we gonna get the copy of the degas
and all the other stuff up to richmond &apos;s in the first place ?
you &apos;re gonna do it .
how ?
we &apos;re gonna need a bazooka .
you are looking at an at4 recoilless rifle .
made by saab , fielded by u.s. and swedish forces .
very popular in afghanistan last summer .
how many do you have ?
we &apos;ll go with 200 .
should i be asking how you got them ?
let &apos;s just say they fell off a truck .
how do i know nothing broke falling off that truck ?
oh , consider this a floor model .
test it out , and if you like it ,
we can talk about the other 199 .
obviously i can &apos;t test it here .
oh , take your time .
you know , i &apos;ll be in touch .
enjoy . enjoy .
okay .
the elevators are mine , neal .
the rest is up to you .
team one in position on the stairs .
thanks , jones . we &apos;re moving in .
i got it .
what are you planning to do with this ?
always be prepared , right ?
right .
fbi . we have a warrant to search the penthouse .
agent peter burke .
i have a hostile witness on my hands .
do you have a storage room or an office that i can borrow
while i &apos;m conducting my business upstairs ?
yes , sir . right over there . i &apos;ll show you .
oh , come on , peter . you cannot lock me in here .
watch me .
under no circumstances is he to leave .
he has no medical condition ,
he &apos;s had enough water , and he &apos;s been to the bathroom .
if he calls you , don &apos;t answer .
if he requests anything , don &apos;t acquiesce .
am i clear ? i am the only person to open that door .
i &apos;ll be back down later .
everything okay with neal ?
he won &apos;t be going anywhere .
are you there , moz ?
no names , nea-- oops .
got it .
what the hell ?
we &apos;re stuck . jones ,
we &apos;ve got a delay . stand by .
call down to the guards .
we need this elevator moving immediately .
operation fedibuster is in play .
all right . tell me when .
yeah , we &apos;re stuck .
are you sure ?
what ?
are you kidding me ? yes , we &apos;re sure .
get this elevator moving . come on .
now !
you &apos;ll have to be patient .
this could take a second .
get this elevator moving . come on !
opening door now .
neal , hurry up .
that was close .
it got my pulse going .
get us up or get us down .
i don &apos;t care what you do , just get us out of this elevator now .
you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m rebooting the system , ma &apos;am . it takes time to initialize .
get it done .
hey , you know where he hid the painting ?
i have an idea .
found it .
hurry , neal . your time is running out .
finally .
jones , we &apos;re on our way .
roger that .
neal , get out of there !
they &apos;ve reached the penthouse . get out of there .
coming !
come on in .
after you .
you didn &apos;t bring the guns ?
no . we brought this warrant instead .
peter burke , fbi .
jones , we &apos;re clear .
elliott richmond , you &apos;re under arrest
for illegal arms trafficking .
neal , peter and diana are with richmond .
i &apos;m getting out of here . good luck .
see you on the other side , moz .
nailed the landing .
i need a drink .
took you a while . run into some problems ?
richmond went down without a fight .
you found it .
don &apos;t jump to any conclusions .
kramer still needs to weigh in .
all right .
any verdict yet ?
this is consistent with the period
where his dark palette gave way to bold colors .
the strokes angle slightly to the right .
so it &apos;s real ?
the signature is dead on .
degas was losing his sight toward the end .
there &apos;s a crispness --
neal , stay out of this .
no , no , he &apos;s quite right . but the oil is the real tell .
to make a work look authentic ,
pigments are bound with linseed oil ,
which takes roughly 50 years to dry .
when that finally happens , the oil starts evaporating ,
causing the surface to crack .
however ...
may i ?
please .
thank you .
yeah .
these micro @-@ cracks are slightly immature
for a work that &apos;s supposed to be over a hundred years old .
good eye , mr. caffrey .
little more time in the oven , and it would have had me fooled .
so it &apos;s a forgery .
i &apos;m sorry , peter .
i know how much you wanted this .
petey ...
we took down an arms dealer
and recovered a number of missing paintings .
this is still a win .
i thought for sure it was the real thing ...
that the treasure was out there .
searching for the truth is what makes you a good agent .
you can &apos;t always be right .
in fact , the hardest thing to do is admit you &apos;re wrong ,
like i seemed to be about neal .
you think he &apos;s changed ?
i can &apos;t say it with conviction that he &apos;s reformed yet ...
but i can tell you he wants to be here .
find something interesting ?
hi , chris .
you went all out for your undercover assignment .
really settled into the bureau .
the tie drawer &apos;s a nice touch .
maintaining cover is my specialty .
oh , i know .
agent jones told me
how much he &apos;s enjoyed working with you all this time .
all right . you caught me .
i &apos;m not who i said i was .
no . you &apos;re neal caffrey ,
infamous con man and forger .
guilty as charged .
how long did you think you could keep this up ?
not long , but i needed to buy some time ,
and it was the only play i had .
melissa , working with peter
has been one of the best things that &apos;s ever happened to me .
but he started cutting me out . you know how that feels .
he wasn &apos;t trusting me .
imagine that .
i needed to know why so i could fix it .
i &apos;m sorry i brought you into this .
obviously , i &apos;ll have to tell kramer everything .
of course . we &apos;ll tell him the truth .
the whole truth .
if i tell him i told you
about the existence of the u @-@ boat manifest over martinis ,
my career is over .
and you know that .
you really are neal caffrey .
welcome to white collar .
it was impressive watching you work .
likewise .
whoever forged that painting
is gonna make our work a whole lot more interesting .
why &apos;s that ?
because it &apos;s the best i &apos;ve ever seen .
we did it , moz .
the fbi is off our trail .
i &apos;ve never known you to pass up a good bordeaux .
notice anything ?
come on .
can we please enjoy our victory ?
neal , i &apos;ve been really patient .
but it &apos;s time for you to make a choice .
do you want to leave or not ?
no .
there are things about this life i &apos;m not ready to give up .
do you even know what this life is anymore ?
i mean , you &apos;re ... on a leash .
you &apos;re still in prison .
you have stockholm syndrome .
i can always walk out that door , moz .
i can never walk back in .
well , then , you &apos;ve made your choice .
i always thought ours would be a happy ending .
if you want a happy ending , it depends --
on where you stop the story .
yeah , orson welles .
i &apos;ll see you around , neal .
you &apos;re fooling yourself
if you think this is who you really are .
honey , you &apos;re gonna drive yourself crazy .
i &apos;m missing something , el .
you &apos;ve looked as hard as you can .
there &apos;s nothing more to find today .
but there will be , and when the right evidence surfaces ...
... i &apos;m afraid this will all blow up in neal &apos;s face .
whatever mess he made , he made it .
and if it comes out ,
he &apos;s gonna have to clean it up .
so ... what ?
so come home ...
have dinner ...
relax with a bottle of your favorite beer ...
and continue working on the case ,
because you are ...
a workaholic ?
... peter burke , the archeologist .
thanks , honey . i &apos;ll be home soon .
okay .
agent burke .
working late again .
you &apos;re persistent , i &apos;ll give you that .
keller .
pardon the theatrics .
but under the circumstances ,
we can &apos;t be having this conversation in person .
i &apos;m sure you understand .
what do you want , keller ?
i need your help .
my help .
turn yourself in . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
yeah , i don &apos;t think i can do that , burke .
but i tell you what --
if you help me , i can help you .
our interests are more mutual than you think .
and you know this how ?
because i &apos;ve seen the treasure .
yeah , your boy caffrey &apos;s got it .
and you want it .
i &apos;m a sucker for the game , burke .
so , you gonna help me or what ?
why would i help you ?
that &apos;s a good question .
how about you go home
and relax with a bottle of your favorite beer
and think about it ?
you could use some alone time .
boss .
neighbors saw a black van , jersey plates .
she was alive when they took her .
we &apos;re all over major transportation centers .
he won &apos;t get out of the city without us knowing .
peter .
