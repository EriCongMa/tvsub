&quot; love turns you upside down &quot;
most people hate hospitals .
but not the interns .
for them , the hospital is a magical place .
it &apos;s poetic ...
the rhythm of the machines .
the crackle of a trauma gown .
it &apos;s a place full of promise ,
excitement ,
surprises .
it &apos;s a place where dreams can come true .
just look at them . they &apos;re so ...
fresh and shiny .
laughing , talking . it &apos;s pathetic .
they &apos;re pathetic .
i can &apos;t believe we used to be them .
why are they still staring at us ?
just keep busy and look cool .
come here .
shane &apos;s right . just gotta focus .
on what , your boobs ?
breast awareness is the first ,
most important part of breast health .
my cousin thought that she had breast cancer once .
but it turned out it was just a big zit .
hey , if you need a breast exam--
i don &apos;t .
are they still out there ?
rounds are in five minutes , freaks .
coast is clear .
oh , thank god .
you &apos;re on peds , right ?
do you want to switch ? i &apos;m with yang .
no , i am not feeding your creepy obsession with karev .
ooh . well , guess you &apos;ll be stuck
watching me outshine you all day , murphy .
don &apos;t take it personally . yang loves me .
no way i &apos;m trading .
i &apos;ve got outpatient surgery with kepner .
sounds like i &apos;ll be cutting all day .
kepner--dud of attendings .
no way you &apos;re doing something that cool .
i like kepner . she &apos;s the only one who &apos;s actually nice to us .
&apos;cause she &apos;s the dud .
well , i &apos;m in the pit with medusa today
if anybody wants to trade with me .
nope .
no .
no .
unh @-@ unh .
you &apos;re late . i hate late .
who &apos;s presenting ?
i guess i am .
samantha morgan , 3 months old .
born with idiopathic neonatal cardiomyopathy .
she &apos;s currently status 1b on the heart transplant list .
what did i miss ? is there any update on a heart ?
i know how hard it is to just sit here and wait .
but sometimes that &apos;s all we can do
until a heart becomes available .
77 days . that &apos;s how long she &apos;s been on the list already .
but who &apos;s counting , right ?
she &apos;ll get a heart . i know she will .
the good news is , your daughter &apos;s stable for now .
oh . oh , no , she &apos;s not--
he isn &apos;t--
i &apos;m not , um ... laura and i met here .
our kids were born about a week apart .
my son rhys is right over there .
we &apos;re both doing all of this alone .
it helps to have a second set of ears
to hear all the medical jargon .
my turn next ?
yes .
rhys rutstein , status 2 on the heart transplant list ,
born with a single @-@ ventricle defect .
post @-@ op from receiving a central shunt
and recovering very well .
it &apos;s possible you might be able to take rhys home
some time next week .
home ? next week ?
ah , yes . there &apos;s no reason rhys has to wait for a heart here .
oh , noah . that &apos;s amazing .
oh , i &apos;m not ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for this .
i mean , i am , but ...
home ...
without all the doctors or nurses or you ...
you can do this . you and rhys are gonna be just fine .
we &apos;ll check in with you later .
dr. yang , did you read the recent
&quot; west coast surgical journal &quot; article on central shunts ?
they listed some very compelling statistics .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll get you a copy .
mm . check out the new girl .
i was gonna call her droopy .
but maybe perky now .
or doc .
damn . look at that thing .
mm . what do those run , 5k ?
i don &apos;t know . it was a gif
oh , from daddy ?
no .
all right . don &apos;t get defensive , princess . just a question .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s your job this morning .
i &apos;m on my way into surgery .
but , uh , little carter kaynig in room nine ,
he swallowed some crayons .
crayons aren &apos;t toxic . don &apos;t we just wait for them to pass ?
that &apos;s exactly what his parents have been doing
for the past eight days .
bowel &apos;s impacted .
the kid &apos;s in a lot of pain ,
and he won &apos;t be passing it on his own , so ...
you don &apos;t want me to--
start digging , princess .
oh . you might want to take off your watch first .
dr. kepner .
i &apos;m here , i &apos;m ready , i &apos;m excited--
stop right there .
that-- all of that fake enthusiasm--
i see through it ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate insubordination .
okay ? so just order these by date of appointment made .
uh ... okay .
problem ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s just ... outpatient surgery .
i was hoping i &apos;d be doing some surgery on the outpatients .
oh , you &apos;ll be cutting .
it &apos;s lump and bump day .
yay ?
this hospital likes to schedule
all of its outpatient mass and growth removals on one day .
so one lucky surgeon will find herself
carving out glorified pimples for 12 freakin &apos; hours .
it &apos;s called whittling .
a hillbilly with a pocketknife could do it .
come with me .
mr. publer ?
pube @-@ publer ?
pu @-@ publer ?
we &apos;re seeing all of them today ?
oh , this is just this morning &apos;s .
sharpen your pocketknife , jethro .
mrs. crossley &apos;s getting a pacemaker today
for a complete heart block .
barring any complications ,
she &apos;ll be going home this afternoon .
what &apos;d they say ?
i &apos;m going home later today , honey .
oh . sorry . he &apos;s deaf in one ear .
we &apos;ll be prepping you for surgery soon .
it should be a fairly simple procedure .
well , i wasn &apos;t planning on staying here overnight .
no one &apos;s arguing with you , honey .
okay . see you soon .
i took the liberty of reserving o.r. three for you .
i know you prefer it .
and i e @-@ mailed you a list of mrs. crossley &apos;s latest rhythms
for reference .
perky ...
man the nicu . check my post @-@ ops .
grumpy , scrubbing in .
ah , look at that . guess i &apos;m scrubbing in .
what are you doing ?
oh . uh , i &apos;m sorry . i was ... i was just--
never mind . i don &apos;t care . go away .
help . we need a doctor . help .
sir , sir . just calm down .
please . just tell me what happened .
i think we killed bigfoot .
bigfoot ?
yeah .
i was just having a go at some whitetails ,
and i heard this scream .
you shot someone ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t see him . i swear .
it just happened so fast ,
and then i saw this thing coming at me ,
like--like a monster .
did you shoot him again ?
i may have fired a warning shot .
and i was just headed into town
and it jumped into the road .
i tried to swerve , but--
wait . you shot bigfoot ?
and then you ran him over ?
yes .
well , where &apos;s bigfoot now exactly ?
you &apos;re doing great .
ultrasound shows the baby has c.d.h.
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
congenital diaphragmatic hernia .
he may not be able to oxygenate well when he &apos;s born .
well , why didn &apos;t you page dr. karev ?
he &apos;s in surgery . he sent you .
okay . okay . um , how old is she ...
the mom ? 15 .
don &apos;t just stand around watching .
do something . my baby &apos;s in pain !
could you page dr. karev again , please ?
aah ! i can &apos;t do this . i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t do this .
yes , you can , kimmy .
one last push . here we go .
okay .
he &apos;s so small . he &apos;s just--
what do we do ? what do we do ?
you &apos;re the surgeon , hon . you tell us .
dr. wilson , what do you want us to do ?
okay , okay .
his sats are low . we need to intubate .
get me a laryngoscope and intubation tray .
it hurts .
it &apos;s okay , sugar . it &apos;s okay . right ?
everything is okay ?
okay , hand me a size 4 e.t. tube .
no , no , no . a smaller one .
sats are dropping .
there you go .
okay , hang on . his epiglottis is floppy .
there no time to hang on .
what &apos;s happening ?
somebody want to tell my baby what &apos;s happening ?
if i could just get this tube to pass .
dr. wilson--
got it . got it . i got it .
you &apos;re doing just fine .
okay .
now what &apos;s next ?
um , i think that , um ...
how about suction ?
and maybe you want to put in an umbilical catheter .
yes . right . yes .
and please page dr . karev again .
i &apos;ll page him .
guy &apos;s crazy , wearing this thing .
i @-@ it &apos;s like he wanted to get shot .
brooks , get over here and help with the cutting .
did you cut him ?
don &apos;t cut my ghillie suit .
his what ?
it &apos;s army issue . best damn camouflage there is .
yeah , for war . not hunting deer .
we wear orange coats for a reason .
oh , i got it . i got it .
you know , i myself prefer hobbies like
stamp collecting or crochet--
something that doesn &apos;t involve guns and ...
helpless little creatures .
um , brooks , escort the gentlemen outside .
okay .
this way .
hi , dr. torres ,
we just heard back about the cadaver nerves ,
but the longest they have is 7 centimeters .
oh , damn it . we need more than that .
okay .
no blood in the pericardium .
there &apos;s definite abdominal guarding .
brooks , reach in my left pocket .
get my phone .
go into my phone book .
go to &quot; shepherd
nancy , amy , liz , and kate . &quot;
call all of his sisters .
see which one &apos;s willing to donate a nerve .
first one that bites , grab me .
okay , derek was very clear .
he wants to use a cadaver nerve for his hand surgery .
you &apos;re on sister duty . go .
you &apos;re sure you don &apos;t need more hands ,
you know , in here ?
we got this . nope . we got it .
we should turn him over .
yes . see if there &apos;s an exit wound . yeah ?
okay .
fill me in .
baby born with a c.d.h. i intubated him .
but the sats are still low .
ah , it could be pulmonary hypertension .
you ever hooked a baby up to ecmo before ?
i never intubated a baby before five minutes ago .
okay , we hook up catheters into his neck ,
pump his blood into the ecmo machine ,
which puts in oxygen , and takes out the carbon dioxide .
then it cycles it all back in .
okay .
you need to make sure that you get good borders
so we can send this to path .
whoa . that &apos;s ...
whoa .
what do you mean ? what &apos;s &quot; whoa &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know . it just keeps coming .
you don &apos;t know ?
hi .
i know how scary this must be for you .
but i want you to know that we are taking
really good care of you , okay ?
dr. ross ...
a word .
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s disgusting .
you were , like , a magician with a handkerchief .
ross , these lumps are attached to people .
scared people .
you need to acknowledge that fear and ease it .
you look them in the eye , you talk to them like you care .
i @-@ imagine if it were you and i was pulling
a wormy handkerchief out of your flesh .
i ... i &apos;m sure you think this is beneath you .
okay ? i get it .
i know you guys call me &quot; the dud . &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t mean that these patients
don &apos;t deserve your respect and care ,
no matter how crappy you feel .
do you understand ?
i ...
i think so .
enough with the attitude .
hello ?
and here you go . i &apos;ll see you soon .
dude , i am a rock star .
i just rocked pacemaker post @-@ op dictation on my own .
that is how much yang trusts me .
that &apos;s cool . mm @-@ hmm .
not as cool as this maybe .
that &apos;s disgusting .
yeah .
hey , have you seen leah ?
&apos;cause i have some more gloating to do .
oh , yeah . i just passed her .
9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 in the nicu , i think .
what do you see ?
is that an effusion around his heart ?
how could he have c.h.f. ?
he has a shunt .
his shunt might be leaking .
he &apos;s tamponading .
what happened ?
he was fine , and then he just--he wasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;ll be okay .
let &apos;s prep him for transport .
what can i do ? do you need another set of hands in there ?
i need you to keep an eye on my patients
and call the o.r. tell them we &apos;re coming up .
huh . look at that .
guess i &apos;m scrubbing in this time .
uh , the bullet &apos;s torn through the colon .
we &apos;re gonna have to resect this .
um ... she belong to any of you ?
brooks , do i look like i enjoy multitasking ?
what &apos;s the report ?
i @-@ i left messages for kathleen and amy .
nancy hung up on me . i called her back .
she hung up on me again so i &apos;m guessing that she &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
but i did talk to lizzie , and she might be in .
also , she wanted to know what size zola wears now .
and i thought maybe a 2 @-@ t , but that &apos;s just a guess .
anyway , can i scrub in ?
meredith .
i just got call from lizzie .
she &apos;s under the impression she &apos;s gonna donate a nerve to me .
yay !
not yay .
i thought i made it clear ,
i didn &apos;t want my family involved .
well , a live donor nerve is preferable .
and it &apos;s definitely easier to find .
my hand , my sisters , my decision .
the longer we wait , the less chance we have that it will work .
and we need this to work ,
sooner rather than later .
sounds like a no @-@ brainer to me .
but what do i know ? i don &apos;t have sisters .
who &apos;d you get to make the calls ?
call them all back and undo what you did .
now .
don &apos;t undo a thing .
you &apos;re doing great .
you &apos;ve isolated the jugular and the carotid ,
avoided the vagus nerve .
now you need to put in a venous drainage cannula .
i hadn &apos;t even--
he &apos;s coding . switch with me .
you need to do c.p.r. while i hook the kid up to ecmo .
at the same time ? how will that work ?
start the compressions now .
stop .
go .
keep going .
stop .
okay . keep going .
stop .
go .
how long have we been going ?
20 minutes .
stop .
karev , i heard you had a crash ecmo .
you need my help ? you need me to take over ?
no , no , just connecting it to the circuit .
okay .
initiate bypass .
we did it .
son of a bitch .
and it seems like only yesterday that i was
showing you how to do your first pulmonary hypoplasia .
i hope you &apos;re taking notes , wilson .
he &apos;s one of the good ones .
so what &apos;s next ?
well , now that he &apos;s hooked up to ecmo ,
the baby needs to be monitored 24 / 7 .
gonna be a long day and a longer night .
you might want to go grab a power nap , princess .
why do you keep calling me princess ?
mm . have you seen yourself ?
you see anything ?
looks great so far , ma &apos;am .
what is it ?
hi .
i know this must be scary for you right now .
i want you to know we &apos;re gonna take really good care of you , okay ?
there &apos;s just a little gross-- growth ... bump
on your ...
bottom .
excuse me .
what do you do when you need to ...
sorry .
when you need the lab to fast @-@ track a ...
a specimen ?
what is wrong with you ?
that lady has the most disgusting butt scab . it &apos;s just--
oh , my gosh . you &apos;re a child .
tell the lab to ...
tell them that i said
to push this to the front of the line .
we &apos;re gonna need those results stat .
would you mind doing it ?
nope . yours .
leah &apos;s a shark .
don &apos;t know why yang can &apos;t see it .
oh , how great does this feel ?
hit me , vitamin d. mama needs a power nap .
i smell crab cakes .
we &apos;re by the kitchen .
no , it &apos;s not crab cakes . it &apos;s meat loaf .
i love / hate it so much .
oh , man . it &apos;s like vegas in there .
no idea when it &apos;s day or night .
sun , meet shane . shane , sun .
nice change from the black hole of sepsis
i &apos;ve been staring at for the past half @-@ hour .
you should see the thing growing on this one woman &apos;s ass .
it is so nasty .
wouldn &apos;t bother me . i am just fine with nasty things .
although all karev does is call me &quot; princess . &quot;
what is that ? i don &apos;t act like some priss , do i ?
am i prissy ?
what ?
i am not prissy .
how do you like that ?
you spit like a priss .
stop .
just let it go to voice mail .
i can &apos;t handle another raging shepherd sister .
actually , i think you should take this .
it says &quot; bigfoot . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . &quot;
i &apos;m here . i got your page . how can i help ?
oh , sorry , sorry . that was me .
i needed grey . i forgot you had her phone .
um , well , maybe i can help since i &apos;m here .
i could--i could irrigate that wound or--
are you gonna get that ?
hello . dr. grey &apos;s phone . heather speaking .
oh , hey , lizzie .
yeah , i know . she just keeps getting cuter every day .
um ... okay .
i &apos;ll ask .
great . bye .
what did she say ? that zola &apos;s the cutest niece ever
and she &apos;s wondering if you &apos;re visiting for christmas ,
&apos;cause there should be snow .
okay . what about the nerve ?
uh , she &apos;s getting back to me .
hi , again .
mm @-@ hmm . i understand .
it is a lot to ask .
hey , hang on .
heather brooks .
hi , kathleen .
how did you get my cell phone number ?
sorry . hang on .
yes , liz .
i @-@ i have kathleen on another line .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know if she booked her flight yet .
please don &apos;t make me repeat all of that to her .
sorry . the other line &apos;s going .
hello . oh , hang on .
dr. grey , it &apos;s dr. simpson &apos;s office .
they want to confirm your ultrasound .
hang up . right now .
oh , is rhys out of surgery already ?
no .
i just--i couldn &apos;t wait in the surgical waiting area .
it &apos;s where i found out my wife had died .
it &apos;s not my favorite place .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
they &apos;ll page me when it &apos;s done .
and in the meantime ,
i get to watch laura play solitaire on her phone .
i &apos;m addicted . it &apos;s pathetic .
she never takes her eyes off the screen .
you know , i don &apos;t even know if she knows what i look like .
big nose , receding hairline , tiny , beady eyes .
well , i &apos;ve been told i look like george clooney .
dr. edwards , i &apos;ve got u.n.o.s.
on the line for dr. yang .
oh , my god . it could be samantha &apos;s heart .
or it could be a routine call .
this is dr. edwards .
part of my job is to keep you
from letting your emotions get away from you .
remember ?
but , yeah , it could be her heart , and by the end of the day ,
she could have a chance at a real life .
yes , i &apos;ve got the chart right here .
and rhys is gonna get out of surgery .
and they &apos;re both gonna be regular kids .
and you and i are gonna
keep being there for each other ...
&apos;cause i can &apos;t imagine going through any of this without you .
i mean , i ... i can &apos;t imagine life without you .
how is that for not letting my emotions get away from me ?
okay . good @-@ bye .
was that ... is there a heart ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna go find dr. yang .
dr. yang , i just received a call from u.n.o.s.
a heart &apos;s available .
we have an hour to let them know if we want it .
we want it . call them back right away .
charge to 5 .
is there a heart for samantha ?
mr. rutstein , could i talk to you ?
uh , what is it ? is rhys okay ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
he &apos;s in critical condition .
oh , god .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
mr. rutstein , could i speak with you privately ?
oh .
i &apos;ll be outside if you need anything .
no .
stay . i ... i want you here .
i need you here .
rhys has gotten worse ,
much worse , &apos; causing his status to change .
he &apos;s been moved to the top of the transplant list .
there is a heart .
our team is harvesting it as we speak .
but if it &apos;s in good condition , it &apos;s not going to samantha .
it &apos;s going to rhys .
don &apos;t even try to get in on the transplant .
it &apos;s mine .
we don &apos;t have to do this .
the fighting , the competing , it &apos;s ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
you worried that yang &apos;s starting to like me better ?
please tell me that heart is on its way .
the harvest team will be here in 30 minutes .
good .
what &apos;s wrong with your face ?
i had to tell noah his son gets a transplant
in front of laura .
it &apos;s like i personally stole her daughter &apos;s heart .
an equation decides where the heart goes ,
not us .
i know .
scrub in on the transplant , grumpy .
it &apos;ll cheer you up .
&quot; gosh . i &apos;m so sad and sensitive .
i really could use some cheering up , dr. yang . &quot;
nicely done .
you &apos;re saying , the baby needs that machine to stay alive ?
well , for now . ecmo , it works a little like bypass
to give your grandson &apos;s heart a rest .
for how long ?
&apos;cause my friend nikki &apos;s having a party for me on friday ,
and i &apos;m supposed to bring the baby .
kimmy , your baby will be here a lot longer than friday .
how much longer ? weeks ? months ?
it &apos;s hard to know at this point .
i &apos;ll have to call nikki .
she ordered cupcakes and stuff .
mom , where &apos;s your phone ?
oh , here .
kimmy , would you like to go in and see your baby now ?
no , thanks .
are you sure ? you won &apos;t hurt anything .
i can wheel you right up next to the bed .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s gonna know who i am or anything .
i &apos;m tired . can i just go back to my room ?
sure , baby .
oh , i can &apos;t believe we didn &apos;t get through everybody today ,
and now ... i am on lumps and bumps again tomorrow .
still , we got through a bunch of ...
word of advice .
you want to avoid lump and bump day again ,
uust make sure you pass your stupid boards ,
or you will always get stuck doing ...
sorry .
you can go , ross . that &apos;s all .
you want me to help tomorrow ?
don &apos;t mock me , ross .
it &apos;s been a long day . just ...
get outta here .
oh , my god congratulations .
no !
did the doctor call back ?
yes .
to confirm your appointment for the 8 @-@ week ultrasound ?
so you know that ?
i do ?
okay , let &apos;s be clear .
you never heard anything . you know nothing .
and you don &apos;t ever mention any of this to anyone , ever .
you got it ?
is there anything else you would like to say
before we drop this subject for the rest of eternity ?
congratulations ?
i can &apos;t wait to scrub in on something like that .
that should be me down there .
look at that .
yang just ligated the pulmonary artery with one stitch .
she &apos;s incredible .
yes , she is .
you sure you &apos;re not asleep with your eyes open ?
you &apos;ve been staring at that kid for an hour .
she didn &apos;t even want to see him .
she cared more about her best friend &apos;s stupid pizza party
than seeing her child .
well , she &apos;s 15 .
it doesn &apos;t matter . she oughta--
you don &apos;t know her story .
not everybody lives in a perfect little world like you .
i never said my world was perfect .
oh ... princeton , harvard , perfect gpa .
look , not all of us go to ivy league schools
or drive fancy cars
or rely on our richy @-@ rich daddies
to bankroll our pretty little lives .
some of us have to overcome more than others .
i know that .
so ... get over it , princess .
you &apos;re in no position to judge .
did you also know that i blow my nose with $ 100 bills ?
and my 1 @-@ year @-@ old birthday cake
was made out of caviar .
gross .
also , in one of the rooms
of my obscenely big mansion ,
instead of paint , i just lined the walls with mink .
shut up .
it &apos;s true .
guess how many fireplaces i &apos;ve got .
four .
27 .
well , 28 if you count the butler &apos;s room .
but , please , he &apos;s the help .
explains a lot .
obviously , the next 24 hours will be critical , but so far ,
he is the poster child for transplant .
do an a.b.g. every two hours
and monitor his ph level .
we &apos;ve been waiting for a heart for months .
her sats aren &apos;t budging .
she &apos;s dying .
i sit here and play solitaire
because i can &apos;t watch my baby die .
and i ...
that was her heart .
that was her heart , and you ...
i want to be happy for you .
but right now i can &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t .
oh , give me that coffee .
i &apos;m so tired right now , i &apos;m sleepwalking .
which i do , by the way .
in college , i sleptwalk into this guy &apos;s room ,
and when i woke up , we were doing it .
no , he was hot .
oh . where did you get that ?
the coffee cart &apos;s closed .
would you judge me if i told you
i stole it from a nurse when she wasn &apos;t looking ?
she &apos;s a stealer , too . little baby hearts .
no wonder you guys get along so well .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be with karev in the ecmo room ?
yeah , but i keep falling asleep ,
so he sent me out to walk around and wake myself up .
because a tiny , fragile baby &apos;s life
is in my very tired hands .
that &apos;s frightening .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s awesome .
all the attendings are asleep right now ,
and we &apos;re in charge .
we &apos;re saving lives .
i &apos;m making phone calls .
uh , lifesaving phone calls .
and you &apos;re removing warts .
and saving lives .
and she &apos;s stealing surgeries from me .
stop complaining .
this is it , you know ? we &apos;re surgeons .
we &apos;re no longer med students waiting to be surgeons .
we &apos;re--
help ! someone help us !
what the ...
oh , my god .
oh , hell , no .
god , i love this job .
mr. crossley , you need to put your wife down .
i &apos;ve got her . just let go of her ankles .
i &apos;m not putting her down .
if i put her down , she goes out .
sir , we &apos;re doctors . we can help .

i &apos;ll grab a crash cart .
i &apos;m picking her back up .
sir , sir . you need to back away .

what the hell ?
now get us a real damn doctor !
so , mrs. crossley ,
you went home , you were feeling fine ,
you had a coughing spasm , and then , uh , you passed out ?
yes .
she slipped when i tried to pick her up ,
so i just grabbed her by her ankles .
and she regained consciousness .
please tell me i don &apos;t have to spend
the rest of my life upside down .
oh , no . your coughing episode
knocked the ventricular lead from your pacemaker loose .
we &apos;re gonna have to open you back up and reposition the lead .
this is it , people .
your chance to scrub in on one of the coolest ,
most innovative surgeries you will ever see .
was that a yawn ? avery , did you see a yawn ?
brooks , you &apos;re out .
but--
if you can &apos;t handle one overnight shift ,
you can &apos;t handle this surgery .
look alive , people .
all right . now the rest of you
will each get a chance to examine our patient
before we move on to the skills lab portion of the contest .
dr. avery , will you bring in our patient ?
now dr. torres and i
will be performing a nerve transplant
on dr. shepherd &apos;s injured hand .
we need an intern we can trust .
and that &apos;s saying a lot ,
because we don &apos;t trust any of you people yet .
wilson , you &apos;re up .
oh . i &apos;m not gonna bite you , wilson .

you &apos;re done .
ross .

yeah , i know who you are , shane .
i know . i was just ...
do you have any pain with prehension or pronation ?
yeah . it &apos;s getting worse , though .
okay .
i know this must be scary for you .
it would be for me . that &apos;s for sure .
but dr. torres and dr. avery ,
they &apos;re really talented .
they &apos;re gonna take really good care of you .
i know it .
okay , we &apos;re done .
i &apos;ve selected our winner .
ross is the only one
who actually treated the patient like a patient .
congratulations . you &apos;re on the team .
thank you .

i &apos;m the one that &apos;s got her leads .
i got the chart .

ooh . too late . i &apos;m done .
oh , my god .

what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re trying to kill me ! that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
kimmy , hey .

the south elevator &apos;s actually a little bit closer .
i could take you there--
that &apos;s okay .
were you discharged already ?
where &apos;s the damn elevator ?
uh , my shift &apos;s not over for another couple of hours .
what time are you coming back ?
you don &apos;t have to talk to her , kimmy .
i @-@ i ...
i &apos;m not coming back .
wait . what ?
of course you are .
whoa . hey , hang on . you can &apos;t just leave .
you have a baby . she has a baby upstairs .
he &apos;s 1 day old .
yeah , and he &apos;s all messed up .
so you &apos;re just gonna--
you can &apos;t-- you can &apos;t abandon him .
no , you can &apos;t . no .
no ! let me on .
no . - you don &apos;t want to mess with me .
you don &apos;t want to mess with me .
no , stop . you can &apos;t walk out on that baby !
you can &apos;t do that !
get off me !
no !
let her go !
no !
hey , let &apos; em go .
you &apos;re crazy !
let &apos; em go .
why aren &apos;t you in the tunnels ?
interns always hang out in the tunnels .
this place smells like fish .
look , i don &apos;t know what your deal is ,
but you can &apos;t go around assaulting patients .
she was abandoning her baby .
then let the cops handle it . it &apos;s not your job , princess .
stop calling me princess !
my mother left me at a fire station
when i was 2 weeks old .
i got bumped around foster homes till i was 16,
when i took matters into my hands
and started living out of a car .
i parked it behind the gym of my high school
so i could sneak in and use the showers before class .
my home ec teacher-- ms. schmidt--
she let me do my laundry there for free .
and , yeah , i got into good schools
because i worked my ass off .
and when i walked across that stage at graduation ,
i didn &apos;t have a cheering section
filled with my richy @-@ rich family .
i had one person-- ms. schmidt .
that &apos;s it .
she &apos;s the one who gave me this watch
when i got the job .
her son works for the company .
it is a nice watch .
thanks .
this was not just my fault .
it sure as hell wasn &apos;t mine .
you could have killed her .
i understand competition and drive ,
but you two , you need to figure out how to work together ,
and you better do it fast .
you &apos;re both off my service .
i &apos;ll do you one better .
you &apos;re both banned from the o.r. until further notice .
thank you .
guess what .
butt @-@ scab lady was seen by oncology last night ,
the mass was malignant .
they said i might have got it all .
what are you doing here ?
i told you i &apos;d come help
with the rest of your lumps and bumps today .
who put you up to this ?
because nobody slums it down here unless they have to .
i &apos;m here because i want to be .
all i ever wanted to be was a surgeon .
and now torres just chose me to scrub in
on one of the coolest surgeries i &apos;ll ever see ,
because of you .
you gave me 27 solo procedures yesterday ,
at least one of them saved a woman &apos;s life .
i &apos;m grateful for this job and i &apos;m grateful to you .
i &apos;m hardly slumming it .
so i &apos;m gonna glove up ,
and i &apos;m gonna help you with your lumps ...
and you &apos;re gonna like it .
okay . fine .
but you get the nasty smelling green one in bed two .
i &apos;m off dr. yang &apos;s service now .
but i wanted to come by one last time to--
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
could you excuse me for just one minute ?
yes .
you okay ?
they say there &apos;s still a chance he may reject the heart .
he won &apos;t reject it .
... this happened before .
it has nothing to do--
hey , you .
yeah , you .
dr. shepherd .
did you or did you not shut things down with my sisters ?
don &apos;t bring brooks into this .
you brought brooks into this .
they are your family and they want to help you .
right ?
oh , oh . you &apos;re asking me ? yes .
um , they seemed willing to help .
of course they want to help me . i practically raised them .
but if my sisters find out that i need help--
look , who did you call so i can call and shut this down ?
don &apos;t tell him that .
don &apos;t tell her not to tell me .
all right , enough .
you know that live nerves are better than dead ones ,
even i know that , and i &apos;m an intern .
and you , you put me in a really awkward position today .
you just threw me to the wolves .
not that i &apos;m comparing your sisters to wolves .
but oh , my god . they &apos;re out for blood .
they are furious with you that you didn &apos;t call them yourself .
and they told me some things .
okay ? unkind things .
and now i know stories about you . and you , too .
i know things about both of you that i don &apos;t want to know .
i don &apos;t want to be in on your secrets or your fights .
it makes me really , really , really uncomfortable .
let me guess . your parents had a messy divorce ...
and always put you in the middle . am i right ?
how &apos;d you know that ?
lucky guess . lizzie .
one of the wolves .
good to see you , mer .
i hope you got some baby pictures handy ,
because i did not take the red @-@ eye
just so my brother could hack my nerves into hamburger meat .
there don &apos;t have to be harps playing
or birds singing or rose petals falling from the sky ...
i have never been this tired , ever .
i have a jacket .
it &apos;s so far away .
i just want to go home .
hunt really put you guys on probation ?
and there are definitely days when the romance is dead .
but ...
if you look around ...
coming through !
things are pretty amazing .
so stop for a second .
enjoy the beauty .
feel the magic . drink it in .
watch your back !
&apos;cause it won &apos;t last forever .
the romance will fade .
things will happen .
people will change .
out of the way ! out of the way !
love will die .
but ...
maybe not today .
