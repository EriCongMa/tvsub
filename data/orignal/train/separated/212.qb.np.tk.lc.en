gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i see you met my daughter .
raina thorpe .
i have decided to set my sights
on a company that has just come back up on the block--
bass industries .
my car is just outside .
i &apos;ll wait five minutes before taking off .
what in the hell were you trying to do ?
get ben out of prison .
what , by putting me in ?
the information about ben
and the affidavit can never get out , ever .
i &apos;m here to see ben donovan .
i &apos;m sorry . you just missed him .
mr. donovan was released .
are you free for coffee ?
i &apos;m free for anything .
have you come to recruit another virgin to be your drug mule ?
i would say , why , are you available ?
brr , upper east siders .
it &apos;s cold outside .
and as february approaches ,
we need to find ways to fight frostbite .
some keep warm the old @-@ fashioned way .
who knew what a turn @-@ on it would be
to sleep with a woman trying to buy my company ?
as long as we play clean in business ,
i &apos;m happy to keep it--
dirty between the sheets .
some seek the comfort of loved ones .
and some try to keep away the gloom ...
what are you doing up this early ?
by painting things bright .
breakfast with ben . and don &apos;t lecture .
he &apos;s a nice person-- a nice , innocent person
who deserves a friend
after what my mom did to him .
a lot of mascara for a friend .
but you can have breakfast with whomever you want .
i don &apos;t judge . well , today i don &apos;t ,
because today everything is new and fresh and golden .
today my internship begins .
you &apos;re finally going to tell me where it is ?
it &apos;s too important . i can &apos;t jinx it .
i &apos;ll tell you after my first day ,
but i must go .
but you realize most offices aren &apos;t even open this early
unless you &apos;re interning at a doughnut shop ?
i want to be early . what is wrong with being early ?
catch the worm !
okay , i &apos;ll see you at the &quot; w &quot; party tonight .
and good luck at your new job at the mayor &apos;s office
or the whitney or cia or ... whatever .
this--this is like living with don draper .
lily , again , thank you so much for getting me this opportunity .
just so you know , it may not be what--
don &apos;t worry . i realize most internships are about
exploitation and espresso runs .
i &apos;m just happy to get a chance to be around writing again .
well , then you &apos;re welcome , daniel .
how about a celebratory breakfast ?
uh , you know , i @-@ i can &apos;t . i &apos;m super busy .
i gotta--i gotta limber up for all this bootlicking
i &apos;m gonna be doing , but thank you .
okay . bye .
well , at least one of our kids appreciates me .
lily .
i get ben out on parole ,
but serena and eric continue to treat me like i &apos;m toxic .
i know you did what you could ,
but ben &apos;s still gonna have a criminal record .
give them time .
everything i do or have ever done
is for my children .
and someday they &apos;ll realize that .
right ?
no , please , let me .
i asked . you got last time .
i &apos;m sorry i had to leave so abruptly .
my , uh , friend edward was waiting for me .
how &apos;s life on his sofa ?
pullout couch beats a prison cot .
serena ... the reason i asked you here
is &apos; cause i heard from an old college friend .
he &apos;s starting an organic farm in ithaca ,
wants me to move up there .
ithaca--it &apos;s supposed to be beautiful .
but are you sure ?
being outside all day , working with my hands--
after being cooped up for so long ,
it &apos;s kind of ideal .
yeah . well , i hope we get
to spend some time together before you go .
i &apos;m leaving tomorrow .
i wanna start my new life as soon as possible .
i hope you understand .
yeah . yeah , of course .
i &apos;m sure we can ,
you know , write or e @-@ mail or call or ...
i &apos;m really happy for you .
take care , serena .
rufus , hey , you used to have
a plot in a community garden , right ?
you gotta be kidding me .
&quot; scorpio rising &quot; was a great film .
that dreck puts the &quot; ick &quot; in &quot; esoteric . &quot;
all right , fine . we can go see
the merchant @-@ ivory retrospective .
you can ensure that your delicate sensibilities aren &apos;t disturbed ,
and i can catch up on my sleep .
going to movies is a one or ... 4 @-@ time thing .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re friends .
i never suggested we were ,
but i am going to see the joseph beuys exhibit in chelsea .
oh , you are such a boy . how could you go to that
when the degas is about to close at the morgan ?
you are such a girl . i &apos;m gonna take a pass on the ballerinas .
frilly dresses and tutus are not my idea of art .
fashion is the most powerful art there is .
it &apos;s movement , design , and architecture all in one .
it shows the world who we are and who we &apos;d like to be ,
just like your scarf suggests that you &apos;d like to sell used cars .
vanessa gave me this scarf .
look , i @-@ i have to go . stop wasting my time .
you know today is a big day for me .
so you &apos;re gonna finally tell me what internship you got ?
no , all right . well , then i won &apos;t say
which one i got either . i will see you sunday at the morgan .
i will wear my most fashionable toe shoes .
don &apos;t get your hopes up .
serena . hey , it &apos;s great to see you . i heard about
the ostroff center , and juliet giving you the--
the drugs that you sold her ?
i had no idea what her plans were .
i wanna make sure that you &apos;re okay .
look , i couldn &apos;t care less about clearing your conscience .
when are you gonna realize your occupation hurts people ?
i don &apos;t give anyone anything
that they don &apos;t come looking for .
okay , well , then i guess you &apos;re only half responsible
that i almost died .
&quot; w &quot; stands for &quot; way better &quot; than i even imagined .
i &apos;m already planning outfits in my head .
if you mean outfits for lara stone to wear
in our meisel shoot on friday , i would love to hear
your thoughts , but if you &apos;re dreaming
about what you &apos;re gonna wear to the party tonight , think again .
i saw that movie , too , but this is real life ,
not some hollywood chick flick where a girl with a scrunchie
gets a makeover and triumphs in the end .
i have never owned a scrunchie .
i think i read that on your resume ?
down there is the main production area ,
conference room , and through those doors--
editor in chief , stefano tonchi .
and how soon can i get a sit @-@ down with him ?
i have some exciting new ideas
that i &apos;ve organized in a powerpoint presentation .
i &apos;ve been stefano &apos;s assistant since he took over .
i &apos;ve barely had five minutes alone with him .
but my research says he has an open door policy ,
that he &apos;s collaborative .
doesn &apos;t mean he isn &apos;t crazy busy .
then it sounds like he needs my help immediately .
ah , you &apos;re all so young , so adorable .
all who ?
all of you interns .
but i ...
thought it was just me .
thousands of applications .
these are the best of the best .
i &apos;m the best of the best . i &apos;m blair waldorf .
assuming that &apos;s your way of saying
you &apos;re the most distinguished , ambitious student
at your school , then they &apos;re all blair waldorfs--
from princeton , yale ,
penn , and parsons .
here you are .
this must be our sixth and final intern .
oh , i think there must be some mistake .
daniel gumphrey , n.y.u. ?
i &apos;m epperly lawrence , your supervisor . welcome to &quot; w. &quot;
nothing says january like a brand @-@ new cold war .
hey . um , mrs. humphrey ?
oh , jonathan , hello .
eric left this in class the other day .
i thought he might need it .
oh , that is so considerate . jonathan , how are you ?
i haven &apos;t seen you since you ...
eric and i broke up , probably .
well , not that i see my son much these days either .
he &apos;s been with elliot nonstop since they got back from gstaad .
what ?
elliot broke up with eric over the holidays .
it &apos;s ... all anyone was talking about
the first day back at school .
but eric slept at his place last night .
hey . brought you some coffee .
she looks a little lost .
can i ... help you , miss ?
um , no , thank you .
i &apos;m just here to bring something to a friend ,
but i think i have the wrong address .
is your friend an ex @-@ con ?
then you &apos;re in the right place .
this is a halfway house .
focus on your work ethic , not your wardrobe .
&quot; w &quot; is about more than just fashion and beauty .
we do probing interviews , an art issue .
we &apos;re looking for visionaries .
get out of here , humphrey . this is my world .
i can &apos;t just quit . when lily said conde nast ,
i figured she meant &quot; vanity fair &quot; or &quot; the new yorker ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean she didn &apos;t pull every string
she had on my behalf .
turns out it &apos;s easier to get a guy paroled
than it is to get a magazine internship in this town .
you don &apos;t know the difference between rodarte and road kill .
you &apos;ll be guillotined .
we &apos;re interns .
i may not know couture ,
but i know how to collate .
and i know how to staple , so stay out of my way ,
or i &apos;ll use one to attach your tongue to your shoulder blade .
blair ?
i &apos;m sorry . dan here was just telling me how much he &apos;d love
to work for &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s right . you &apos;re the writer .
maybe you could do something special for our new blog ,
we &apos;re announcing tonight at the party--books , movies ,
&quot; fashion on film . &quot; this month we &apos;ll be in celebration
of contemporary authors , and lynn hirschberg &apos;s
writing the intro . i &apos;ll be sure to introduce you .
wow . thank you .
jonathan ? what are you doing here ?
where were you last night ? and don &apos;t say elliot &apos;s .
i called over there and spoke to his mother .
well , i was with a friend .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that you two broke up ?
i didn &apos;t wanna share a huge fact from my life .
i wonder where i got that gene from .
now you listen to me--
lily , can i maybe talk to eric alone ?
fine .
are you okay ?
what &apos;s going on with you and your mother ?
oh . now you care . &apos; cause you didn &apos;t when you dumped me .
i was angry , and rightly so , but ...
i &apos;ve always cared , and you know that .
it &apos;s my family , and ... and elliot ,
and it &apos;s just been ... a rough few weeks for me .
but i missed having you in my life .
well , i &apos;m here now .
uh , your mother said you guys
were going to some party tonight .
is there any chance you &apos;d wanna bring someone along
to be there for you , help keep the peace ?
make fun of everyone we see ?
yeah , that sounds perfect .
no , i don &apos;t know .
there .
okay , i &apos;ll let her know .
what &apos;d he say ?
these strappy zanottis would look great
with your sweaty gym socks .
epperly asked me to pull the lemon louboutins .
oh . you poor lost lamb .
let me help you .
i didn &apos;t date serena van der woodsen
for two years and not come away knowing
that those are marc jacobs , and they &apos;re mustard .
ugh ! why does this taste like chanel no. 5 ?
hey , i was , uh , just getting myself a cappuccino .
i thought you might like one , too .
the nutmeg foam-- that &apos;s a humphrey touch .
my dad used to own a coffee bar .
thank you , daniel . that &apos;s very thoughtful .
who &apos;s got a stapler ?
give it up , blair . i &apos;m actually good at this ,
and unlike the other interns , i know you .
your stupid tricks won &apos;t work .
oh , look , it &apos;s georgina &apos;s baby .
where have you been ? i &apos;ve been calling you .
your parole officer told me
you missed another job interview .
i didn &apos;t wanna tell ya until everything was settled .
i have incredible news .
i got a job--
a real job ,
as a financial advisor in a top tier company .
are you serious ? dad , that &apos;s great .
i never thought it would happen again--
the suits , the business lunches , the ability to pay
my own hotel bills .
i can &apos;t stop pinching myself .
what &apos;s the firm ?
thorpe enterprises .
i &apos;ll be working with russell thorpe himself .
see you later , pal .
hey , chuck .
did i just walk past your dad
in a $ 2,000 suit ?
seems the captain , who could barely get an interview
for a custodial position , got a big executive job
with the guy trying to buy your company .
so ... how are you enjoying your first day ?
well , what should have been perfection
has now been tainted by a run @-@ in
with brookyln &apos;s benedict arnold .
how am i a traitor ? the only reason
you &apos;re still here is &apos; cause no one has ratted out
your attempts at sabotage to epperly .
and the only reason you &apos;re still here
is because no one &apos;s asked you , &quot; who &apos;s givenchy ? &quot;
lynn hirschberg &apos;s flight from dublin got canceled .
i knew stefano should &apos;ve made that colin farrell interview
a phoner instead .
hirschberg &apos;s out .
major disaster .
unless someone ... shows up with a new author
and saves the day .
yes .
and when she does , she will shine
as the best intern .
and her insipid competition will be fired .
you do realize that i know
jeremiah harris personally , right ?
and you do realize that i know everyone personally , right ?
okay , so then we &apos;ll both show up with our authors
tonight at the party , and whoever epperly decides
is the best fit for &quot; w &quot; wins . the other resigns .
i can agree to that .
it &apos;s gotta be a clean fight .
do you understand that as a concept ? no sabotage ?
i can &apos;t wait to see you bleeding on the rack .
but yes , no sabotage .
hey , is eric here ? i &apos;m supposed to take him to lunch .
oh , he &apos;s brooding in his room .
here . vanya asked me to give this to you .
what is it ?
everything okay , lily ?
yes , it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;ll deal with it later .
oh , come on , mom . we &apos;re all trying
to move forward here . no more secrets .
well , it &apos;s not a secret . in fact , i have no idea
what it is or who it &apos;s from .
then what &apos;s the big deal about opening it in front of us ?
this was for ben .
&quot; please use this money to start a new life
far away from me and my family . &quot;
charming , mom .
seems serena &apos;s getting frosty with her mother
over an envelope of cold @-@ hard cash .
looks like not everything or everyone &apos;s
on sale this january .
well , at least now i know why ben lied .
he doesn &apos;t wanna have anything to do with me because
i &apos;m the daughter of the person that ruined
the last three years of his life
and is trying to ruin the rest of it .
$ 30,000 would hardly ruin his life .
you said you were gonna help ben find an apartment ,
not pay him to disappear .
mom paid someone off again .
well , we should make this a drinking game .
ben donovan has information that can ruin this family .
what &apos;s wrong with not wanting him around ?
because he &apos;s blameless .
because he was a wonderful teacher
who can &apos;t do what he loves thanks to you ,
and because he deserves more .
i &apos;m going out .
i &apos;m right behind you .
yeah . hold the elevator .
well , i did a little humphrey smooth talking ,
and jeremiah harris said he &apos;d be delighted to come ,
so i &apos;m just gonna add his name to the list real quick .
oh ! well , you can put him under lorrie moore , my author .
he &apos;ll be most comfortable there .
i don &apos;t think so . before jeremiah harris was a novelist ,
he wrote film reviews for &quot; vanity fair , &quot;
and he had a wine column in &quot; bon appetit , &quot;
and stefano also knows him from the &quot; times . &quot;
so ? lorrie moore was a 2010 finalist
for the p.e.n. / faulkner award .
true . maybe she is a better get .
oh , but did i mention that jeremiah
is on the board of admissions at williams ,
where stefano &apos;s niece is applying to college ?
so glad you called . afternooners are my favorite .
i thought you said you were totally aboveboard
when it comes to business .
i did ,
and i am .
so why did you hire my best friend &apos;s father
to work for your company ?
the captain ?
he and my dad are old friends .
my father believes in second chances ,
and we need someone who knows the lay of the land .
his son &apos;s my roommate . it &apos;s an obvious conflict .
chuck , we just met . i had no idea who you live with .
i know that you &apos;re sensitive to this ,
i assure you , thorpe enterprises has no interest
in corporate espionage .
even so , i spoke to nate .
the captain &apos;s a loose cannon .
i &apos;d consider it a personal favor
if you &apos;d have him fired .
now ... what were you saying about afternooners ?
actually ... i just remembered i have a meeting .
sorry , chuck .
your mother might be up to her old tricks ,
but maybe it &apos;s best for ben
to get a fresh start without you .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
i just don &apos;t want to go down without a fight .
speaking of fights , i &apos;m at full @-@ on war with humphrey .
b. , i know you like to turn
everything into a contest , but surely dan
isn &apos;t your biggest competition at &quot; w. &quot;
all the other girls are variations on a theme ,
and that theme--slightly lesser versions of me .
but ... dan is a writer .
he makes delicious coffee .
never mind the fact that
he &apos;s not a completely horrible @-@ looking straight guy
working at a fashion magazine .
he &apos;s got the whole office buzzing .
sounds like someone &apos;s feeling a little threatened .
well , not for long . my author will make his look like
a monkey with a typewriter ... or maybe
an invisible monkey with a typewriter .
b. , i hear scheming in your voice .
you cannot sabotage him .
why not ? i &apos;m not gonna treat him any better
than all my other enemies just because
you sporadically love him .
he &apos;s not your enemy .
earn the spotlight on your own merits .
you &apos;ll feel better .
well , i &apos;ll call you later . let ben go ?
let dan be .
oh , picking up a late lunch for epperly ?
no . actually , it &apos;s for you .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s not poisoned .
i wouldn &apos;t wanna win due to my rival &apos;s starvation ,
and i figured you were too much of a food snob
to deign to eat at the commissary .
and epperly needs me to alphabetize . duty calls .
fancy seeing you here , mr. donovan .
damien dalgaard .
i heard you went to the pokey for poking a student .
congratulations on getting out .
sure you &apos;ve been doing a lot of celebrating , yeah ?
wanna buy some party favors ?
so it &apos;s true .
straitlaced academic star became a dealer .
guilty .
i remember that paper you wrote
comparing &quot; the wire &quot; to &quot; the iliad . &quot;
did not intend for english comp
to be an occupational training course .
well , you always said what we learned in high school
would inform our futures in unexpected ways .
yeah , the thing with &quot; the wire &quot; is
the witnesses usually had evidence
before they testified .
i know you were the one who said you saw
me and serena at that b &amp; b .
i told the truth .
nothing happened between me and serena that night ,
but i went to prison anyway .
you say &quot; potato . &quot; judge says &quot; pedophile . &quot;
well , it &apos;s been great catching up , mr. d. ,
but my friend just arrived .
i &apos;d introduce you , but you may or may not have
statutorily raped his sister . might be a tad awkward .
let &apos;s go . get a table .
good job today . i think you could be
a great fit here , provided you survive .
i try and stay out of the intern drama ,
but i couldn &apos;t help but notice
your friend blair &apos;s a little competitive .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i admire your loyalty .
maybe the striver thing is all an act ,
and maybe it &apos;s just a coincidence
that my coffee tasted like her perfume .
i &apos;m sure you know her better than i do .
yeah , i do know her .
i know that her kindergarten yearbook quote
is &quot; the best defense is a good offense . &quot;
hi . uh , ms. moore , i &apos;m an assistant at &quot; w , &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid there has been a terrible mix @-@ up .
careful , d. , it &apos;s flu season ,
but nothing &apos;s more contagious than mistrust .
i &apos;ll be right back . one second .
uh , where &apos;s mom ?
she &apos;s still licking her wounds .
we were all pretty hard on her this afternoon .
i never would have come to a party like this without her ,
but i needed some air .
oh , hey , i get it . being in a room
with a selfish manipulator can really suck the life out of you .
she &apos;s worried . she &apos;s just trying to protect her family .
hey .
you two have a good time . i &apos;ll see you later .
great party .
are you hungry ? there &apos;s appetizers .
yes , yeah . i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;ll grab us some , yeah ?
thakery , imoon , enjoy your treats .
um , i need to talk to you .
chuck bass ... and no guest .
you may enter .
blair waldorf working the door ?
i got an internship at &quot; w. &quot;
knowing you , you &apos;ll be editor by may . your plan &apos;s working .
so it seems to be .
ben , you came .
thank you for meeting me here . can we talk ?
serena , i &apos;m actually here because i saw your brother eric
with damien dalgaard , who we both know is a drug dealer .
no . no , no . eric hates damien ,
and he doesn &apos;t do drugs ,
so there--there must be some sort of explanation .
jonathan . hey .
by any chance , have you seen eric ?
eric ? no . the guy should become a magician .
he disappeared .
i thought we were here on a date .
i guess i &apos;m getting played once again .
i &apos;m sorry . a date ? what about elliot ?
elliot dumped him .
he didn &apos;t tell you ?
he promised me he was over his jenny humphrey phase .
i guess he was wrong ...
or maybe i was , for believing him .
it &apos;ll be okay . come on . let &apos;s find him .
lorrie is a bit late ,
but she &apos;ll be here any minute .
i hope jeremiah brought his &quot; a &quot; game .
oh , he &apos;s not here yet either .
any reason you think he might be late ?
the guy is a famous recluse .
he might not show up at all . it &apos;s your fault for picking him .
my fa--oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
we said no sabotaging .
what are you talking about ?
jeremiah . hi .
mr. humphrey , show me to the bar .
i warn you , if the krug is warmer than 55 degrees ,
i &apos;m leaving .
jeremiah harris ?
epperly lawrence .
yes . how do you do ?
daniel told me you were in a bit of a bind .
nice . let &apos;s get you a glass of wine .
i &apos;ll tell you all about our plans .
o.m.g.
i was just poleaxed by a poor person .
fancy seeing you here .
chuck , this is stuart fuji . he &apos;s in the film business .
stuart , can i borrow her for a moment ?
what are you doing with that bore ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
actually , i &apos;m having a nice time .
stuart understands that when i say i &apos;m telling the truth ,
i am .
raina , you &apos;re trying to take my company .
how can i just trust you ?
you &apos;d think less of me if i did .
i couldn &apos;t think less of you than i do right now .
sorry .
i wouldn &apos;t be like this if it wasn &apos;t my father &apos;s legacy .
stakes are too high to take a chance on trust .
hey .
it &apos;s just business .
from now on , i don &apos;t even know if we have that to discuss .
maybe eric went home .
he doesn &apos;t really like parties anyway .
he can &apos;t be buying from damien .
come on .
your sister just clocked us .
okay , wh @-@ what do we do ?
just go with me on this one .
well , i &apos;m gonna go get a drink . would you like anything , babe ?
so you &apos;re damien &apos;s &quot; babe &quot; now ?
you ... williamsburg weasel !
i can &apos;t believe you stabbed me in the back .
i only did it because i thought you did the same to me .
hillary clinton is one of my role models .
i do not break treaties , you ass ,
but i do secure borders ,
so i &apos;m gonna go tell epperly what you did right now .
no . blair , wait . look , we can-- we can figure something out .
let go of me , you classless cling @-@ on .
blair , do not go to epperly . i need this job , all right ?
no !
oh , no .
oh , is that ...
stefano tonchi . i &apos;m on the list .
stefano , this way , please .
spotted--dubious friends in definite hot water .
obviously , you &apos;re both fired . go back to the office
and pack your things .
looks like &quot; w &quot; just left dan and blair
both out in the cold .
i just got an interesting phone call from raina thorpe .
did you tell chuck to have me fired ?
let me guess . uh , you thought i &apos;d embarrass you .
the thorpes were trying to take over bass industries .
we thought they might be using you just to get information .
i &apos;m a grown man , nate ,
and i &apos;m actually good at what i do . chuck is family .
i would never do anything to jeopardize things for him .
you do realize that &apos;s a total contradiction , though ,
being chuck &apos;s family and then working for the thorpes ?
word around the office is that he &apos;s banging thorpe &apos;s daughter .
talk about sleeping with the enemy .
but that &apos;s chuck &apos;s decision , okay ?
and whatever happens with raina is on him and him alone .
you need the second chance .
you can &apos;t go down in another scandal .
so you &apos;re getting me fired instead ?
all those nights in prison ,
when i thought i couldn &apos;t take it ,
when i wanted to quit
or die or ... i didn &apos;t , because i knew there was still
one person out there who believed in me .
dad , you &apos;ll get another job .
yeah , washing toilets .
you know what ? i think i &apos;d rather live in a halfway house
than live with someone who only halfway trusts me .
come on . it was just an internship .
i &apos;m sure you can have your mother call
and get you a new one in a second .
my mother didn &apos;t get me &quot; w. &quot; she &apos;s a designer .
she can &apos;t call in favors from a fashion magazine .
well , you don &apos;t get jobs like this without a connection .
well , i did . i practically stalked stefano .
i spent the night at his lobby waiting to meet him .
and after the police escorted me out for the third time ,
i faxed a letter to every machine in the building .
that &apos;s like 200 fax machines .
332 .
wow , blair , i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know any of this .
what , the fact that you were willfully ignorant
is supposed to make me feel better ?
you wanted an internship . i wanted this one .
so why didn &apos;t you just sabotage me ?
you had every opportunity .
guess i must have some undiagnosed brain injury ,
because i stupidly thought
that this fake friendship might be real .
damien dalgaard , of all people--
you know what kind of person he is .
oh , so now you wanna get all sisterly ?
you &apos;re dating a demon .
can &apos;t you see
he &apos;s using you like he did jenny ?
why ? &apos; cause nobody could ever like me for me ?
hey , i know what it feels like when you think
you got no one to turn to .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m ben , serena &apos;s--
non @-@ rapist but still technically ex @-@ con former teacher .
you have taken up a lot of time over the dinner table
at our house .
i &apos;m sure all that drama has been overshadowing
what &apos;s going on in everyone else &apos;s life , especially yours .
no offense , man , but mind your own business .
when i got locked up ,
i ... befriended some not very good guys .
found out the hard way ,
when you do things that betray who you are ,
it can become very difficult to recognize yourself .
i don &apos;t wanna see that happen to you .
please , eric .
mom did this awful thing ,
and--and you went away to ostroff ,
and i was looking so forward to just being away with elliot
and having somebody to talk to ,
and then he broke up with me , and i didn &apos;t have anybody .
you always have me .
no , i didn &apos;t . you were off chasing some judge ,
trying to help him .
i don &apos;t want to feel sad .
i didn &apos;t wanna feel anything , and the one thing about damien
is he is a good distraction , but ...
you &apos;re right .
thank you .
i won &apos;t see him anymore .
um , serena , can i speak to you ?
it &apos;s okay . i gotta go anyway .
what juliet did-- has it crossed your mind
that ben was at least partially responsible ?
he wanted revenge because he thought i put him in prison .
but that &apos;s in the past . you know , he just gave eric
some really fatherly advice , helped convince him
to stay away from damien dalgaard .
damien ?
look , i would love to explain ,
but i need to find ben right now .
epperly , uh , it &apos;s dan humphrey .
i know i ruined your party
and humiliated your boss
and there &apos;s no reason for you to want to listen to me right now ,
but i &apos;ve got to tell you something .
eric .
i just heard that you &apos;ve been hanging out with damien .
are you doing drugs ?
you know , i could lie and say no .
um ... but i bought sleeping pills .
and then i needed adderall to wake back up ,
but that was it , and , um ,
it was stupid , and i &apos;m done with it .
if you need help , i wanna make sure you get it .
no , i don &apos;t care about the drugs .
damien was just there when no one else would listen .
ben , wait . please don &apos;t avoid me .
i wanna be your friend .
serena , it &apos;s a lot easier for me to start over
without any reminders from my past .
but why ? i saw you talking to eric ,
and it reminded me of what you were like
at boarding school .
i &apos;m not that person anymore .
yes , you are .
you wanna know why i &apos;ve been avoiding you ?
because i see that look in your eye ,
and i know exactly what it means .
but i don &apos;t wanna be with you .
i didn &apos;t reciprocate back then , and i don &apos;t now .
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry , s. looks like the only thing
you &apos;ll be snuggling up with this winter are warm memories .
i &apos;m not heartbroken . i &apos;m humiliated .
i was falling for someone who wants nothing to do with me .
and i thought i found my calling ,
and now the only thing that brings me any joy
is planning dan humphrey &apos;s long , slow demise .
epperly ?
it &apos;s 9 : 20 , where are you ?
w @-@ what are you talking about ? you fired me .
yes , and then dan confessed that you were the one
who called jeremiah , and he took credit for it and then
staged that whole wrestling stunt to embarrass you .
i was totally wrong about him . if you &apos;re gonna be
a backstabber , just stab some backs , you know ?
are you saying ...
that alex white is styling eight looks today ,
and i need someone to steam the couture ? yes .
i &apos;ll be there in 15 . you know what i just remembered ?
if you really want something ,
you don &apos;t stop for anyone or anything until you get it .
thanks for meeting me .
serena told me how helpful you were with eric yesterday .
just saying what i thought .
ben , i realize my wife hasn &apos;t treated you justly in any way .
i &apos;d like to help .
you &apos;re not gonna offer me more money , are you ?
you deserve a real shot at getting back on your feet again ,
and that &apos;s gonna be tough to do living in a halfway house .
i have an extra room at my loft ,
and i @-@ i &apos;d love it if you moved in .
after everything that &apos;s happened ,
it &apos;s the least we can do .
i haven &apos;t experienced a lot of kindness lately .
i gotta think about it , but ... sounds good .
take your time .
hi . could you connect me to room 312 , please ?
howard archibald .
what do you mean , he &apos;s checked out ?
yeah .
this winter ...
thank you .
even though we bundle up ,
a cold shoulder can freeze us out .
i heard about what young bass asked raina to do .
it &apos;s terrible .
well , i &apos;m just thankful she gave me the heads up
and you gave me a chance to talk .
we &apos;re old friends , and you &apos;re doing a bang @-@ up job .
i , uh , should &apos;ve told you about my plans
for bass industries ,
but i didn &apos;t wanna put you in a compromising position .
i completely understand , and i can assure you ,
there are no conflicts anymore . whatever you need , i &apos;m your guy .
what are you doing here ?
i was wrong to ask you to fire the captain .
stuart , a moment ?
yes , you were .
i told you who i was when we met .
i don &apos;t play games
in business or in my personal life .
my father is gonna do everything humanly possible
to acquire bass industries .
it &apos;s not a secret . it &apos;s a fact .
i know . i apologize for losing sight of that .
look , you &apos;re a beautiful girl who says what &apos;s on her mind
and isn &apos;t afraid of the consequences .
i don &apos;t want to stop seeing you .
i can handle the complications if you can .
hmm . i think complications
are the least of what i can handle .
but ...
there is a man ... in a towel
in my bathroom right now .
so ...
maybe another time ?
you look good here .
guess it turns out your friend wasn &apos;t worthy .
tell me about it .
i &apos;ve been trying to convince people for years .
but just so you know , he was never really my friend .
sometimes a ray of sun shines in and gives us hope .
i offered ben the apartment , and he &apos;s thinking about it .
thank you so much , rufus .
we &apos;re just not gonna take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
ben is still a good person . i @-@ i know he is .
consider this a warning . stay away from serena .
stay away from her family . i remember your father ,
and i think we both know how he would respond to your dealing
if someone were to tell him .
what do you care , huh ?
those people ruined your life , not me .
you actually like her .
how i feel about serena is none of your damn business .
the only thing you should be worried about is disappearing .
hey . what are you doing right now ?
sorry , damien , but i &apos;m done with the pills .
no , that &apos;s not what i meant . you wanna hang out ?
as friends .
but on the upper east side , the slipperiest ice ...
uh , sure . why not ?
good .
... is usually right in front of us .
good .
