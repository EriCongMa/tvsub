there &apos;s got to be something !
i &apos;m sorry , lieutenant .
there &apos;s nothing more we can do .
sure you don &apos;t want a cup ?
steve ?
no , no , thanks .
i know you have a lot of questions , steve .
yeah , why don &apos;t we start with shelburne .
shelburne was the code name the agency gave me .
i &apos;m s ... i &apos;m sorry .
agency ? what agency ?
before i met your father ,
i worked for an intelligence program
that reported directly to the pentagon .
you were a spy ?
yes .
so , all those years that i thought you were a ...
a schoolteacher , that was just ...
a cover .
and , um , were me and mary just a cover , too ?
shelburne was way before you and mary .
how &apos;d you meet wo fat &apos;s father ?
he was an assignment .
so , you were ordered to kill him .
it was a little more complicated than that .
well , we got some time , so why don &apos;t you ...
why don &apos;t you uncomplicate it ?
okay .
like you , i served my country .
but after i got married , i left the agency
because i wanted to be a mother .
unfortunately , i could change my name , but ...
not my past .
that &apos;s why you pretended to be dead ?
when i made that choice ,
i knew that my life would never be the same .
i knew that i would have to give up
the only thing that meant anything to me : my family .
so , why &apos;d you do it , doris ?
if that &apos;s even your real name .
it was the name i was born with ,
and the name ... the name i went back to
the day i met your father .
and since when does a son call his mother by her first name ?
since you failed to be one 20 years ago .
i didn &apos;t see any other options , steve .
wo fat was looking for the person who murdered his father
and he was willing to kill anyone who stood in his way .
so you faked your own death ?
yeah , i did what i had to do to protect my family .
you know , dad sent us away thinking he had to protect us .
then he spent the next 20 years looking for your killer .
all that was for nothing .
if i had told him the truth ,
wo fat would have executed him .
wo fat executed him anyway .
you and mary , you ...
god knows you deserved better .
i @-@ i just didn &apos;t know what else to do , steve .
i ...
but never once , did i spend a day not thinking about you .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
it &apos;s the truth .
what am i supposed to do with that truth , huh ?
i just forgive you now ,
is that it , we move on ?
no , i just ...
i &apos;d just like you to understand .
i &apos;d like you to just ...
try to understand .
pack a bag .
pack ? what do you mean ?
where are we ... where are we going ?
we &apos;re going home .
it &apos;s not safe , i can &apos;t .
wo fat can &apos;t hurt you .
he &apos;s being transferred to a supermax facility
on the mainland today .
by the time we land in oahu ,
he &apos;s out of our lives forever .
unit six be advised .
unauthorized air approach from the north .
roger , one .
all units be advised ,
we have lost transport .
repeat , we have lost transport .
open it up .
come on !
frank delano .
nice to meet you .
on the phone you said
you were bringing shelburne back .
yeah , this is shelburne .
you can call me mom , someone should .
mom ?
whose mom ?
that &apos;d be mine .
doris mcgarrett .
danny williams .
you know , uh , for a woman
who died in a car bomb 20 years ago ,
you are remarkably well put together .
thank you , i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
sorry to interrupt here .
danno , i appreciate the homecoming ,
but what &apos;s with the police presence ?
you didn &apos;t have to go to all this trouble .
this is not for you .
it &apos;s for shelburne .
why me ?
wo fat escaped .
what are you talking ... when ?
two hours ago .
steve , if he finds out i &apos;m on this island ...
that &apos;s not going to happen .
we &apos;re gonna put you someplace safe
and we &apos;re gonna hunt down wo fat .
call chin and kono .
have them meet us at the palace .
what ? what is it ?
uh , there &apos;s something else you need to know .
he hasn &apos;t left malia &apos;s side
since she was brought in .
chin .
i &apos;m so sorry .
so , wait out here .
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
delano said he was monitoring your lines ,
hpd &apos;s , too .
if i would have called you ,
kono and malia would have been killed immediately .
we should have been there with you .
no .
there was nothing you could have done .
i want delano .
no , my man had no choice .
governor , frank delano grabbed officer kalakaua
and threatened to kill her if he wasn &apos;t released from prison .
no , s ... ye @-@ yes ,
i understand that , sir .
lieutenant kelly exercised his full immunity and means ,
believing he could contain the situation on his own .
i remember chin ho kelly .
he was a few grades ahead of steve in school ,
was a good boy .
good boy turned into a good cop .
losing his wife like that just ...
no , governor ...
... makes me think of steve &apos;s dad , you know ,
just what he must have gone through .
yeah , well , a good thing for chin is
that he doesn &apos;t have any kids
that are gonna be asking , &quot; why isn &apos;t mommy coming home ? &quot;
like i said , my man had no choice , governor .
you married ?
uh , no , not anymore .
kids ?
i do , i have a daughter
named grace .
uh , best thing that came out of my marriage .
you ever think about going for round two ?
i &apos;d actually rather get kicked in the face with a golf shoe .
hmm , so , what , you &apos;ve taken a vow of celibacy or ... ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
uh , i am seeing somebody .
just-- we &apos;re just taking it very slowly .
yeah , well ,
why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for free , right ?
yes , i understand that , sir .
this is getting very personal , don &apos;t you think ?
don &apos;t you want your daughter to see you
in a healthy relationship ?
uh , respectfully , i don &apos;t think
you are in a position to be giving me parenting advice .
you know what i think , danno ?
i think that you &apos;re afraid of commitment .
that &apos;s incorrect ,
uh , and i prefer danny .
oh , really ? &apos; cause that &apos;s
not what i heard my son call you .
he must think you like it .
oh , he thinks a lot of things that aren &apos;t true .
he &apos;s delusional , actually ,
which , by the way , no offense to the gene pool .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just a one @-@ off .
son of a bitch .
he wants a full inquiry into the delano release .
steven .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , yeah , watch your mouth , steven .
that goes for you , too , smart @-@ ass .
okay .
so what &apos;s the game plan ?
we find delano and wo fat .
and where do we start ?
you don &apos;t start anywhere , doris .
you &apos;re on ice until this blows over .
i survived two assassination
attempts by the plo , steve .
i think i can handle myself , thanks .
i understand that ,
but i &apos;m not going to risk losing you again .
you &apos;re going some place safe , and i &apos;ve got
just the person to make sure you stay put .
thanks for coming .
thanks for calling me .
so , uh , your mom faked her own death
and she &apos;s shelburne .
well , if you didn &apos;t have mommy issues before this ...
that &apos;s cute .
i try .
come on , i &apos;ll introduce you .
doris ,
this is lieutenant rollins .
she &apos;s on leave from naval intelligence .
he refuses to call me mom .
nice to meet you , ma &apos;am .
lieutenant rollins ,
i told my son i didn &apos;t really
need anyone to look out for me .
oh , he &apos;s just being overprotective , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s a seal thing , and please call me catherine .
what does my son call you ?
former intelligence agent .
needs to know everything .
unless it &apos;s apparent .
catherine , would you like some tea ?
i was just gonna make myself a cup .
that would be great , thank you .
you ?
i &apos;ll pass .
okay .
she &apos;s something .
yeah .
so , have you told your sister yet ?
no , i don &apos;t really feel
like i can tell mary this one over the phone .
milk and sugar okay ?
uh , yeah , sounds perfect .
cath , listen , i got to go , okay ?
keep the doors locked .
swat &apos;s right outside if you need anything .
listen , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m gonna look after her like she &apos;s my own mother .
okay ?
that came out wrong .
i didn &apos;t think so .
steve , we figured out
who helped wo fat escape this morning .
it was frank delano .
delano ?
after wo fat &apos;s transport van was dumped at sea ,
i assumed he was picked up by a boat ,
so i checked the security cam footage
of the local marinas of boats leaving and returning ,
and i got a hit .
wo fat and delano have to be working together .
the only thing is ,
we can &apos;t figure out what they &apos;re up to .
there &apos;s nothing in their files that indicates
they knew each other before today .
what else did the video give us ?
i only got a partial plate number
of the vehicle they left in .
we &apos;re running it through hpd .
a partial is going to take time .
maybe not--
the van that they were driving had some rear @-@ end damage ,
which means that our driver or whoever owns that car
probably got into a traffic accident .
if they reported it , hpd will have it .
all right , good .
chin , kono , check it out .
yeah , we &apos;re on it .
looks like we got the size right .
what am i doing here ?
right to the point .
i like that .
i &apos;m not gonna waste your time .
i &apos;m about to come into possession
of a very large amount of
a certain controlled substance .
i assume that &apos;s the reason you &apos;re still on the island .
i ain &apos;t leaving without souvenirs .
problem is , my most recent incarceration left me
without the resources to unload this kind of weight .
you want me to help .
i need your connections .
well , i think the obvious question here is :
what &apos;s in it for me ?
i was gonna offer you a whole lot of green paper ,
but i recently came into some information
that &apos;s significantly more valuable .
and what &apos;s that ?
i know where to find the person
that killed your father .
how do you know about shelburne ?
when you got to the joint , created a buzz .
i made some inquiries .
turns out you &apos;ve got quite the reputation .
where is shelburne ?
on the island .
you &apos;re lying .
that &apos;s not below me , but not today .
i still got friends inside hpd ,
so i know for a fact that shelburne is right here in o &apos;ahu .
before i tell you where ...
... i need to know we got a deal .
we do .
hey , cuz , why don &apos;t you go for a walk ?
i can finish this .
hey , chin .
i heard you .
you don &apos;t have to be doing this right now .
i do .
i &apos;m sorry .
you have nothing to be sorry about .
adam told me what happened-- that you called him
on the way to malia &apos;s .
chin , you tried to save us both .
well , it wasn &apos;t enough .
it was everything you could do .
perimeter &apos;s secure .
come join me .
i really shouldn &apos;t , ma &apos;am .
cut the &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; crap , catherine .
neither of us is in uniform . now , come on .
please just sit down for a few seconds .
you &apos;re making me nervous .
so .
so .
do you love my son ?
do i ... ?
love ... ?
stop ! hold it right there !
go to the bedroom . lock the door .
don &apos;t move !
hey , catherine .
tell these lolos to chill with the inappropriate touching .
he &apos;s clear , boys .
scampi special .
mystery solved .
get back to your job .
mcgarrett had asked me to come with some hot grindz .
better dig in before it becomes shrimp cocktail .
what &apos;s for lunch ?
you were supposed to lock yourself in the bedroom .
i smelled garlic .
i figured it was safe to come down .
so this moms , eh ?
aloha .
aloha .
you must be kamekona .
how did you know that ?
because your face is on that shrimp .
i &apos;d have thought the woman that gave birth
to the great warrior mcgarrett
would have horns and breathed fire .
well , i hate to burst your bubble , but ...
before my son became a great warrior ,
he was just little stevie ,
the boy who wore camouflage footsie pj &apos;s
and called himself g.i. joe .
auntie , tell me you have some pictures .
here we go .
we got a match on that partial plate
from the van delano and wo fat left the marina in .
owner &apos;s name is maria gold .
she filed an accident report a couple of weeks ago
after she got rear @-@ ended on the h @-@ 1 .
it &apos;s consistent with the damage on the van
that delano &apos;s crew left the marina in .
same make and model .
what &apos;s her connection to delano ?
i don &apos;t know , but this woman &apos;s bad news .
check fraud , misdemeanor battery ,
a slew of possession charges .
and now aiding and abetting two known fugitives .
maria gold ! five @-@ o.
clear !
clear !
all clear .
where &apos;s chin ?
guys ! over here .
you got something ?
call max .
tell him to bring plenty of body bags .
all right , thank you .
all right , that was max .
he id &apos;d our five vics .
uh , they are local , they got no priors ,
and they all worked for the same construction company :
hana star renovators .
well , according to the bank ,
the house that we found them in
used to belong to maria gold and is now in foreclosure
so there couldn &apos;t have been any work going on .
if that &apos;s the case ,
then what were our victims doing in this house ?
maybe they were lured there for some reason .
but why ?
i don &apos;t know .
why would wo fat and delano want to kill
five construction workers they got no connection to ?
rachel ?
yeah . i , uh , told her
that i was fighting the custody modification .
i guess that didn &apos;t go over so well , huh ?
think so ?
rachel , listen to me , okay ?
if you have something to say , you can call my lawyer .
i already told you 15 times ,
i am not allowing you to move to las vegas with my daughter .
this is not about me .
this is about grace . this is her home now .
then move !
you move
and leave grace with me .
if you have a problem with that , i will see you in court .
you know , i was thinking vegas is , it &apos;s not that bad , you know ?
i mean , locals call it the ninth island .
they don &apos;t , they don &apos;t call it that for nothing .
okay , do you know
the only thing that i hate more than the ocean
is the desert .
okay ?
the hot , dry , 120 @-@ degree @-@ in @-@ the @-@ shade desert .
okay , so i am not moving there and neither is my daughter .
hold on a second .
i thought you liked vegas .
i lik ... in theory , yes . in theory .
an occasional bachelor party ,
a poker tournament ,
a circus performance , something like that .
i &apos;m mean , to maybe a weekend , but any more than that , i cannot do .
you gotta keep an open mind .
i got ... what , are you trying to get rid of me ?
no , i &apos;m just saying , boo boo , okay ?
boo boo ?
boo boo is a term of endearment .
oh , i know what it is ,
but if you are going to give me a sidekick name ,
a ridiculous sidekick name ,
i should be consulted first .
okay , so bears are out .
they are out .
okay , do you have a point ? were you trying to make a point ?
before you interrupted me ,
i was gonna say that , um ...
i don &apos;t know , man , just think about what you &apos;re doing .
i mean , you and rachel go to war ,
the only person who &apos;s gonna lose is grace .
okay , appreciate your help .
thank you .
that was the owner of the renovation company
that employed our five vics .
he sent them over to maria gold &apos;s house this morning
to write an estimate for a potential remodeling job ,
but get this .
while i &apos;m on the phone with him , his foreman calls
and says the same guys just clocked in at another site .
that &apos;s impossible .
they are in cold storage at the county morgue right now .
wait a sec .
where &apos;s the other job site ?
hpd .
the renovation company is contracted to do cleanup there after the explosion .
did the renovation company say who they were writing an estimate for ?
no . the client gave a fake name .
it &apos;s delano .
he lured those guys to that house , then he killed them .
now he &apos;s using their identities to get in the precinct .
why ?
he already blew the place up ,
put a dozen cops in the hospital .
what else does he want ?
mcgarrett , what &apos;s going on ?
frank delano &apos;s crew is inside your building .
they came in with the cleanup crew posing as workers .
where are they ?
in the basement . clearing debris .
that &apos;s where they wanted to start .
duke , are you guys holding anything in the narco room ?
yeah , the evidence from that big ice bust in kailua .
go !
it &apos;s over here .
he &apos;s dead .
i put him down here to watch the door .
duke , how much meth was in here ?
a little over a thousand pounds .
street value on that kind of weight is $ 30 to $ 35 million .
captain fryer &apos;s killer didn &apos;t blow up this building
as a diversion to evade us .
it was all about getting access to this room and boosting the drugs .
duke , where are their trucks ?
they &apos;re gone .
they must have just left .
duke , call it in .
i want roadblocks and checkpoints .
use traffic cams . air support . find them !
you got it ! go ! go !
mcgarrett , i got &apos; em !
where ?
corner of ala moana and atkinson .
they &apos;re slowing for a traffic collision .
come on , come on , come on . make a left .
what do you want to do ?
go , go , go !
chin ? chin !
cover me !
move !
go .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
you &apos;re not gonna kill me .
you said it yourself .
you &apos;re not a dirty cop , chin .
only a dirty cop would shoot an unarmed man .
the whole area &apos;s been locked down .
no signs of wo fat .
i don &apos;t even think he was with him .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
delano ?
dead .
you okay ?
no .
steve !
steve , over here !
he knows where wo fat is .
where ?
hey , where is he !
sh @-@ shelb ...
shelb ...
catherine , where &apos;s my mom ?
right in front of me . why ?
listen , i think wo fat is on his way to the house .
secure the perimeter . we &apos;re on the way .
was that steve ?
catherine ... what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to come upstairs with me , now .
it &apos;s wo fat , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;ve been compromised .
steve &apos;s on his way .
i want a gun .
keep the door locked .
don &apos;t let anyone in , no matter what happens .
you understand ?
sweetheart , i &apos;ve been doing this before you were born .
you okay ?
where &apos;s wo fat ?
he got away .
mom !
mom !
mom .
you saved my life .
that almost makes us even .
you saved mine twice .
yeah , i remember the night mcgarrett brought wo fat in .
when was the second time ?
the day we met .
i can &apos;t ... can &apos;t leave , steve .
not again . i can &apos;t ...
you can &apos;t stay here .
so long as wo fat is free , you &apos;re never gonna be safe .
well , i can &apos;t go back to japan .
i mean , your search for me compromised that area .
okay , so pick another country .
just don &apos;t tell me or anybody outside of your handlers .
there &apos;s no way to guarantee your safety if you do .
i promise , as soon as this is over
i &apos;ll come and find you .
how ?
same way i did the first time .
okay ? come on .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
good @-@ bye , mom .
just because i wasn &apos;t around
doesn &apos;t mean i wasn &apos;t your mother .
i never stopped loving you .
you okay ?
your mother said that she exchanged gunfire with wo fat , right ?
yeah , right before he escaped out the window . why ?
crime lab just finished processing the safe house .
found evidence of only one weapon being fired in that bedroom .
ballistics matched it to the gun that catherine gave doris .
all three slugs were pulled out of the floor .
so either your mother is a terrible shot ,
or she deliberately tried not to shoot wo fat .
you &apos;re saying you think she let him get away ?
no , i &apos;m asking :
why didn &apos;t she kill him when she had the chance ?
