building inspector , foundation inspector ,
water line inspector , geologist ,
exterminator , plumber , and dad .
abed .

i thought the sound might accentuate
the anxious idleness of our last meeting &apos;s final seconds .
good job , bad idea .
okay , that is done .
yay ! there &apos;s more !
this one is exciting .
we have to rename the save greendale committee ,
due to the fact that greendale is done being saved !
you think that &apos;s more exciting than summer ?
oh , am i stealing your rays , dude ?
come on , it &apos;s neat !
our mission is finally accomplished , once and for all ,
so what do we call ourselves now ?
the accomplishers .
the obsoletists .
steven king &apos;s dreamcatchers .
susan .
you guys are rebelling against yourselves .
you get that , right ?
the current trend in branding is unique ,
simplistic , phonetically memorable gibberish .
how about nipple dippers ?
i like nipple dippers .
yes .

ok .
ooh , nippledippers.com is available .
grab that mother .
done .
nipple dippers , listen up .

hey everybody !
i made it !
obviously , i binged pretty hard there
after the bell rang but ,
i made it !
are you guys going out to celebrate or something ?
maybe i &apos;ll tag along ,
it &apos;s been a tough year , i could use a drink .
we were gonna to britta &apos;s bar whenever- oh .
mother time is willing to call it a year .
kay fine , we &apos;re done , happy summer .
nipple dippers drink for free !
i &apos;ll pay for my drinks , i &apos;m not acknowledging that title .
someone owes me ten bucks for the domain .
i won &apos;t be able to join you .
i gotta get on the road to california .
i got a job through linkedin .
what ? that &apos;s crazy !
people use linkedin ?
no , linkedin hired me to help figure out
why people don &apos;t use it .
also , i have an old lady friend i went to high school with who
just became un @-@ married last week
and i thought i &apos;d look her up .
wow , you work fast .
or actually , very slow .
either way , good luck .
are you coming back elroy ?
i think so .
probably ,
maybe .
have a great summer .
you guys think bars scene always have to start at a billiards shot ?
or do you think every time someone takes a shot a in billiards
they start a new bar scene without knowing it ?
what ?
you can just say shut up abed .
okay , ask me if i &apos;m coming back ?
are you coming back ?
yeah .
probably .
maybe .
i mean what was that , right ?
that was an irish goodbye .
let &apos;s give it an irish wake .
six years guys .
nipple dippers .
nipple dippers .
where &apos;s annie ?
i mean no offense to you guys
but she &apos;s the only one that gets me .
she said she had an interview ?
six years .
six seasons , right abed ?
don &apos;t put a nickel in him .
stop mitigating everyone .
so abed , what happens in season seven ?
oh , man .
i don &apos;t know how likely season seven is .
i mean , what show ever peaks after season six ?
simpsons , seinfeld , south park , friends .
those shows weren &apos;t hemorrhaging characters every year .
oh , i don &apos;t like that word , hemorrhaging .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
what if shirley came back , would that change your disposition ?
shirley could get us back on formula ,
but i don &apos;t see it turning us around .
sorry , what &apos;s our formula ?
well , basically .
i have a placeholder so set up it ,
makes analogies look like punchlines .
my setup lacks awareness ,
but my punchline doesn &apos;t know .
abusively cynical one liner dismissing everything you just said .
absurd reaction .
you guys , can we put a pin in the b story
and focus on the a story ?
i don &apos;t trust a stories . never have , never will .
i had a set up about a story that was so placeholder ,
the punchline came five words early .
and i can tag it too .
i &apos;ll just take a moment to explain the risks involved
in all decisions made from here until eternity .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m frankie dart .
is this combination gonna work ?
not my place to say .
abed ?
lizard .
fire hydrant .
obama .
shane !
you know , i put time into what i do wardrobe wise .
yeah see , shirley , no shirley , what does it matter , right ?
abed , we &apos;re not formulas ,
and if i had no self @-@ awareness , i think i &apos;d know .
things have a certain structure to them , you know ?
if we stray from it , we &apos;re weird ,
if we stick to it , we &apos;re boring .
yeah , but isn &apos;t that more about the shape of your brain , abed ?
i mean , no offense or anything .
but isn &apos;t the shape of your brain kinda fucked up ?
what &apos;s your season seven pitch ?
my pitch for your fall semester at greendale
is that everyone is nice and has fun and grows together .
shirley or elroy ?
see , that &apos;s racist , man .
shirley or elroy ?
that &apos;s racist .
how about they both come back ?
how about there &apos;s a whole third black person ?
where do they all sit ?
they well they sit wherever they want to sit , as of the 1960s .
they sit .
they sit .
just pitch it .
don &apos;t pitch it .
i &apos;m pitching it .
guess what ?
i made something .
i made a belt with fabric .
how cute is that ?
well , i think that &apos;s very cute , so oh ,
and i love you guys .
i &apos;ve got , i &apos;m angry
and you should vote or don &apos;t vote .
sweet ! hallelujah !
these are good times , baby .
good times girl , good times .
hey , i thought of something .
you know , we should go to the
to the to the , to to the market .
yeah , we should .
well , wouldn &apos;t that be like a thing we saw ,
and didn &apos;t we do that ?
so shouldn &apos;t we be more ashamed and clever ?
and make everything more difficult ?
yes , and i think we should be deeply sad .
and i &apos;m nuts .
but i &apos;m happy .
and i &apos;m happy too .
and you know , hallelujah ,
and church , and singing , and street wisdom .
stop !
crazy , and racist , and terrible !
i agree . you &apos;re being way too linear about this .
shirley , elroy ,
troy , hickey , living in the past .
season seven don &apos;t need no past .
what are you pitching ?
don &apos;t pitch !
this is my pitch .
all right , that includes all notes and business
as it pertains to the files .
how are you guys doing ?
babe , how you doing , girl ?
i &apos;m cool , it &apos;s all good .
annie , you &apos;re looking fine .
thank you .
hey , what about me ?
hey everybody , look at me !
i &apos;m ice cube head !
i &apos;ve got an ice cube for a head .
i also eat cell phones , so you better be careful
with those cellphones around me ,
because they taste like prime rib where i &apos;m from .
oh ho ho , boy .
imagine the times we &apos;ll all get in together ,
especially when i use my powers to help solve all your problems .
it &apos;s getting crazy in here !
all right , i &apos;m going home .
what ?
guys , we just finished year six ,
and it was hard work .
and i don &apos;t wanna care about greendale .
and i don &apos;t wanna spend my brief moment of humanity
doing conceptual riffs ,
developing the imaginary tv show of our lives .
by the way , terrible improv .
ice cube head ?
you were just looking at your drink .
busted .
annie ?
i got the internship .
i got the internship ! i &apos;m gonna intern for the fbi .
i &apos;ll leave in a week .
i &apos;ll be in dc all summer .
you &apos;re leaving the nest .
can i have your bedroom ?
if you don &apos;t come back , if you don &apos;t come back .
well , i &apos;m definitely coming back , probably .
maybe , maybe , maybe .
okay , next order of business .
mr. winger , garrett &apos;s holding leonard &apos;s hand again .
garrett , stop doing that .
i &apos;m checking for a pulse .
hey , hands off the leonard dice .
question , when can we start the next paintball game ?
i don &apos;t think he can force it .
lots of things can be forced ,
like a human head through a six @-@ inch drain pipe .
what ?
just kidding , pal .
okay , did anyone on the sustained greendale committee
do any of their assignments this week .
scrunch .
sorry , bro .
i don &apos;t work for you .
you work for me .
i &apos;m the tech billionaire
that bought this dump and cuts your paycheck .
if you can call that a paycheck .
i &apos;ve seen more zeroes over pearl harbor .
there were hundreds of them .
the sky was black with smoke bombs .
double click this , winger .
it &apos;s your job to work .
it is our job to party .
and hatch harebrained schemes .
and get laid .
and get laid .
and eventually leave you here as well .
jeff , you okay ?
oh , i , i was taken aback .
it &apos;s big news .
what have you guys been doing ?
we were just
looking for ways to make season seven work .
i mean we &apos;ve got through six seasons .
i mean what &apos;s up with that ?
where &apos;s season seven ?
i mean we gotta figure out season seven .
or maybe we could just hang out .
sorry i &apos;m late .
last night was so insane ,
it made the insane clown posse look like
the well @-@ adjusted clown posse .
it must be hard work running away from your own age .
has anyone seen my e @-@ cigarette ?
there should be a charity for people like you .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know if i can keep making the commute
from here to the fbi headquarters .
britta , abed , i &apos;ll have to move back in .
i moved in with them .
chang , we have files .
moving out .
you seem stressed , annie .
are those last few criminology credits
you need hard to get at greendale ?
please . the only credit that it &apos;s hard to get
at greendale is from a bank .
it &apos;s just , they have schools for this kind of stuff at quantico .
being with you guys is great ,
but why is this a good choice for me ?
why doesn &apos;t the audience feel sorry for me ?
britta , your parents have been murdered .
by whom ?
the police won &apos;t touch it .
they &apos;re calling it a double suicide .
britta , i got this .
you &apos;re proposing a version of the show in which annie comes back ,
and it hinges on the murder of my parents .
it &apos;s a placeholder .
i &apos;m just saying there &apos;s always gonna be a need for law at greendale .
you remember the ass crack bandit ?
do i remember ? i mean .
doesn &apos;t everybody .
could have been anybody .
what is with this diaper thing ?
is it about shaming me ?
do you really want a bunch of people dressing you ?
it would be polite to try .
it &apos;s nice to see you interested in this stuff , jeff ,
but i wouldn &apos;t watch that season .
me , neither . you wanna know a perfect season seven ?
well , guess what senator ?
you were allowed to call us terrorists
before we moved to international waters ,
but we &apos;re a nation now .
so i guess this is fucking war .
annie , i &apos;m gonna need you to go to washington .
i &apos;m scared .
be more scared than that .
britta .
the protesters are scared .
they need you to talk to them .
they should be scared ,
but they shouldn &apos;t need a leader to tell them what to do .
we &apos;re all born free into a world of lies .
but let &apos;s talk about you for a second , though .
well , i &apos;m not a joke anymore .
i &apos;m strictly transgender .
i &apos;m not all this other stuff .
i represent the transgender community , and it &apos;s a real thing .
i am not crazy , but i do have flaws .
i &apos;m smart .
all this other stuff ?
glad to be of service , britta .
i want my diaper back .
i don &apos;t even own a tv and i wouldn &apos;t watch that .
oh yeah , what &apos;s your pitch ?
oh , well i , i mean , it &apos;s not that complicated is it ?
hello .
hello .
hello .
how &apos;s everyone ?
hello .
i have . we could learn about science
or history , it &apos;s set in a school , after all .
why aren &apos;t we learning ?
and i know that &apos;s not enough , so .
and so on .
boo .
it &apos;s possible there is more skill to it than i thought .
yes , yes , yes .
there is skill to it .
more importantly ,
it has to be joyful , effortless , fun .
tv defeats it &apos;s own purpose when it &apos;s pushing an agenda ,
or trying to defeat other tv
or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing .
it &apos;s tv , it &apos;s comfort .
it &apos;s a friend you &apos;ve known so well , and for so long
you just let it be with you
and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day
or phone in a day .
and it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with levar burton
and never come back .
because eventually , it all will .
i &apos;m fine .
i know .
it &apos;s not just that .
it &apos;s just such a classic mistake , but ...
i got really attached to my pitch .
i had a sound track in my head and everything .
well i agree with abed .
and i have an effortless pitch .
so , how &apos;s this semesters crop of apples looking ?
britta &apos;s been out rotting .
asian kid in my math class doesn &apos;t want to study
because he doesn &apos;t want to be a stereotype .
it &apos;s pretty funny .
sounds like a strong b story .
and i can say that stuff without throwing anyone
because i teach tv appreciation .
chang , you can send that student to me
and we &apos;ll make it more serious .
i &apos;m the school shrink i can wear these glasses every episode .
you are super hot in them .
yeah .
very hot .
this gives me a more solid reason to interact with you
than a stupid committee .
by the way i &apos;m a lesbian .
that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t hit on jeff .
here &apos;s my deal , i teach criminology .
but look , it &apos;s the original annie .
but i &apos;m grown up and i &apos;m hot ,
but not little girl hot .
and i &apos;m happy and we &apos;re all together and it makes sense .
we just might live the good life yet .
hi ! dean !
dean jeffrey .
dean , i told you not to come into the teachers &apos; lounge ,
you &apos;re supposed to be in dean class .
how can i learn to be dean if i can &apos;t hang out with teachers ?
we &apos;re supposed to be shaping minds ,
but we keep shaping each other .
bring it in .
in this version , will you tell me what to do a lot ?
am i on meds in it ?
i &apos;m mellow and relatable .
i like it .
i would love to teach at greendale ,
and i do miss wearing skirts .
why don &apos;t you shallow a horse pill size contrivance ,
it would open up new areas and dynamics .
and it &apos;s evergreen .
well great that &apos;s settled .
how do we make it real ?
annie , maybe you should start looking into education classes .
you too , abed .
well , i should probably tell you guys that i &apos;m moving to los angeles .
what ?
yeah , like a real tv executive
i was letting you guys work your ass off ,
because there &apos;s no profit in saying no to an idea ,
but now that it &apos;s time for me to commit i have to pass .
i got a job as a pa on a fox show ,
it &apos;s in a video game studio .
it &apos;s like 30 rock , meets it crowd ,
meets , well me .
i &apos;m growin &apos; up .
that &apos;s so great abed .
congratulations abed .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
but you &apos;re coming back right ?
maybe .
probably .
maybe .
that &apos;s six seasons and a movie .
jeff i know it comforts you
to look at things through that metal lens ,
but this is reality .
tv &apos;s rules aren &apos;t based on common sense .
they &apos;re based on the studio wanting to milk their properties dry .
here here .
cheers to that and cheers to abed .
cheers !
what , jeffrey ?
and so on .
annie i &apos;m home .
hey there .
how was your day ?
did anything funny happen ?
who cares .
how was your day ?
good . sebastian did some drawing .
sebastian ?
let &apos;s look at him .
sebastian .
sebastian .
back to your child area .
i love you .
are you okay ?
is this really what you want ?
of course .
i mean , i &apos;d be fine with a dog too .
but , whatever you want .
do you have any idea what i want ?
yes .
how &apos;d you get in here ?
i pulled the spare key
so the dean would stop leaving them under the welcome mat .
you left weirdly .
well , there &apos;s no normal way to do anything now .
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , you know .
i don &apos;t wanna be fine .
i wanna be 25 and heading out into the world .
i wanna fall asleep on a beach
and be able to walk the next day ,
or stay up all night on accident .
i wanna wear a t @-@ shirt without looking
like i forgot to get dressed .
i want to be terrified of aids ,
i want to have an opinion about those ,
boring ass marvel movies .
and i want those opinions
to be of any concern to the people making them .
well i want to live in the same home for more than a year ,
order wine without feeling nervous ,
have a resume full of crazy mistakes instead of crazy lies .
i want stories and wisdom , perspective .
i wanna have so much behind me
i &apos;m not a slave to what &apos;s in front of me ,
especially these
flavorless unremarkable marvel movie .
they are so not a big deal !
i know !
it &apos;s just all there is !
yes , and you get to say that !
i could screw myself if i say it ,
but there &apos;s pressures on me you don &apos;t have to live under ,
if you accept that you &apos;re older .
and let the kid stuff go .
i let you go , annie .
from my hands and my head .
the heart ,
which cynics say is code for penis ,
wants what it wants .
but i let you go .
the others are coming .
i think you should kiss me goodbye
or you might regret it for the rest of your life .
what about you ?
oh , i &apos;ll regret the kiss for a week , i &apos;m in my 20s .
who cares ?
are we interrupting ?
stop being gross !
are you guys doing an unauthorized finale in here ?
not cool .
abed , i know it gives you comfort to see everything
through that metal lens ,
but we were just saying goodbye to the room .
for season six .
season seven , who knows ?
it &apos;s out of our hands .
too many variables .
cool . cool , cool .
cool , cool .
cool .
that was one cool for each season .
wait , do it again .
i want to try something .
cool . cool , cool .
cool .
cool , cool .
i farted during the fourth one .
it &apos;s an inside joke .
i &apos;m gonna miss you guys .
gay .
you know what i think everybody should do ,
as a humble outsider that came in and nailed it ?
i think everyone should imagine
their own personal version of season seven
and not share it with anyone .
and then maybe it &apos;ll come true .
no cutting to any of them .
if you cut to it , it won &apos;t come true .
you just stopped being a study group .
i hereby pronounce you a community .
brianna , you &apos;re the driven idealist .
kaylee , you &apos;re the fiery passionate one .
we might have a fun no strings
and mackenzie , the kooky nerdy one ,
and hailey , the other nerdy one !
you guys should be best friends and have pillow fights .
and there &apos;s phoebe , the wise one .
no ? you &apos;re nerdy too ?
okay , and the rest of you are the redhead ones .
and we &apos;re gonna have some pretty crazy times ,
and eventually you &apos;ll leave and be replaced by new ones .
and that &apos;s something i &apos;m equipped to handle now .
i &apos;m sort of the hero that way .
we can cut to them at home though , right ?
i mean by ourselves ?
sure .
i love that i got to be with you guys .
gay .
you saved my life ,
and changed it forever .
gay !
thank you .
i &apos;m gay .
i &apos;m for real gay .
i &apos;m legit gay !
this is the show .
right , that &apos;s right .
community !
the hit show is now a hit board game .
more like an i &apos;m bored game .
shut up , leonard .
you look like a german puppet maker
and smell like the inside of a church .
blah , blah , blah commercial video describing the rules of gameplay .
i like you , leonard .
as a friend .
sorry britta , but that friendship just got a benefit .
collect all the other players &apos; identities
and be the first to figure out
if the game is part of the show or ,
i got it .
the whole show is happening inside this game .
then explain this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a script
of a fake commercial at the end of season six ,
starring this family .
sorry , dad .
guess i win .
you stupid child .
nobody &apos;s winning anything .
don &apos;t you see ?
this means we don &apos;t exist .
we &apos;re not created by god , we &apos;re created by a joke .
we were never born , and we will never actually live .
dice not included . some assembly required .
lines between perception , desire , and reality
may become blurred , redundant , or interchangeable .
characters may hook up
with no regard for your emotional investment .
some episodes too conceptual to be funny .
some too funny to be immersive ,
and some so immersive they still aren &apos;t funny .
consistency between seasons may vary .
viewers may be measured by a secretive obsolete system
based on selected participants
keeping handwritten journals of what they watch .
show may be cancelled and moved to the internet ,
where it turns out tens of millions were watching
the whole time , may not matter .
fake commercial may end with disclaimer gag
which may descend into vain chuck lorre @-@ esque rant
by narcissistic creator .
creator may be unstable .
therapist may have told creator this is not
how you make yourself a good person .
life may pass by while we ignore or mistreat those close to us .
those close to us may be those watching .
those people may want to know i love them
but i may be incapable of saying it .
contains pieces the size of a child &apos;s esophagus .
did you get any of that ?
yahoo !
