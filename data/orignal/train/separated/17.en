Good morning.
An hour ago, I withdrew my name from contention
for the office of State's Attorney.
I did so with great regret
but also with a deep conviction
that neither I, nor anyone associated with my campaign,
was responsible for tampering with voting machines.
But a partial recount of select precincts
has led me to believe
that it is detrimental to the democratic process
for Cook County to be subjected
to a long and drawn-out recount.
I would like to thank
my supporters for their faith in me
and my husband, who has been...
...has been amazing during this difficult time.
Thank you.
Mrs. Florrick! Mrs. Florrick! Over here! Mrs. Florrick!
Mr. Governor!
What do I do now?
Mrs. Nolfi.
I find that the State has proved their case against you,
and as a result, I must find you guilty.
I do wish I had some discretion as to a sentence,
but the number of pills in your possession triggered
what is called a mandatory minimum sentence
of six to 30 years.
I do not believe you deserve such a sentence,
but I am handcuffed.
However, there are still 48 hours
until the sentence must be imposed.
If you can bring me evidence
that will allow me to revisit your conviction,
I will gladly do so.
Mandatory minimum sentencing.
That's why I brought you four here together today.
Jim, Bob,
just 'cause you're two of the most conservative lawyers
I ever met doesn't mean you get to tease Cary and Diane
about their backward liberal ways. Anyway,
this is one area where our political philosophies overlap.
Liberals think that mandatory minimums
are draconian and unfair.
We think they're wasteful and unfair.
Either way, we agree: a policy that's failed.
Are we agreed on the test case?
Yes, sir. Steven Mercurio.
House painter.
He became addicted to painkillers after back surgery,
gave some to a friend who turned out to be an undercover cop.
His mandatory sentence: 12 years.
Jim, Bob, we agreed on this?
For an extra $200 an hour,
you can actually get 'em to speak.
I think we should consider someone else.
Well, a divide in the liberal caucus. What a surprise.
Louise Nolfi, a 62-year-old grandmother.
She delivered a package to the post office.
A drug-sniffing dog alerted to it.
They opened the package and found 26 tablets
of MDMA, Ecstasy,
a six-year mandatory minimum.
Where's the file?
Oh, I don't have one. I just came from court.
We've got a demo problem.
Jailed grandmothers, people can pity.
Jailed white guys,
people can identify.
The house painter, I think.
R.D.
Meet her first.
Why?
You should have all the facts.
Meeting grandmothers isn't facts.
It's manipulative kitsch. And you know it.
Then why not meet her?
You're gonna defend her either way, aren't you?
Yes.
The soft-hearted liberal in her natural habitat.
Ms. Lockhart, Alicia's here.
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.
How may I direct your call?
Alicia's here. I didn't know she was coming back.
Hey, Alicia.
I'm so sorry about everything.
Thank you.
Come on. They're waiting.
Water?
Thank you.
So-- thank you--
Alicia and I have been talking, as most of you know.
And I called her right after her... announcement.
I wish you hadn't backed down, Alicia.
Thank you, David.
And we've talked about it internally here, too, and...
well...
We want you to come back as name partner.
And, um...
you're not worried about my...
situation?
What, a voter fraud scandal?
You mean, after I almost went to jail for six years?
What about you, David? Do you agree with this?
I agree with anything that maintains stability.
Kalinda and I are having some troubles
with the State's Attorney's Office.
We're dealing with it.
And...
my exit package, we already negotiated it.
Bring your lawyer back in, and we'll figure it out.
This is home, Alicia.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
Geneva Pine.
It's Cary.
What can I do for you?
I've thought it over, and I'll do it.
Do what?
Turn evidence against Bishop.
What evidence, Cary?
I'll only do it if I have your guarantee
you'll drop the charges against Kalinda and Diane.
Okay.
Give me a day to get some ducks in a row,
and I'll get back to you.
Odd how things turn out.
A month ago, no one wanted to turn on Bishop.
Now everybody does.
That was Cary.
What do you need from me?
Evidence on Bishop's drug operation,
his subsidiary businesses, all illegal activities.
Look, I won't testify.
Get me something I can use independently
and you won't need to testify.
You can't make a deal with Cary.
I told him I needed a day.
Get me something before then.
I'm not gonna talk about my grandson.
He's turning his life around.
I know, Mrs. Nolfi.
The truth is, the judge is sympathetic with your situation,
but we need to give him a reason to overturn your verdict.
Have you talked to your public defender?
Mr. Bollinger? No. Why?
Well, the judge may be angry with Mr. Bollinger
for not doing a better job.
We can overturn the verdict by arguing ineffective assistance.
I don't want to get him in trouble.
He's such a lovely man.
He won't get into trouble,
but let me talk to him.
Now, gentlemen...
...in this country,
our courts are the great levelers.
And in our courts,
all men are... created...
equal.
So is this what made you want to become a lawyer?
No.
It made a lot of...
people at school want to become lawyers,
but they're all... prosecutors and tax lawyers now.
...reality.
I like when people give speeches,
and it makes other people change their mind.
I know. Me, too.
Do you ever get to do that?
In court?
No.
It's mostly about facts and evidence.
Most of the time you don't really have someone you believe in.
That's too bad.
Maybe it'll be different this time.
What do you mean?
I'm going back to the law firm.
What?
That's great. That's great.
In the name of God...
do your duty.
Um, do you want me to pause it?
No. I know how it ends.
Mr. Gallagher, hello.
Thank you for returning my call.
I know you were wondering if I was heading back to my firm,
and it looks like I am.
You are? You're going back now?
Yes. Definitely.
But I just got a call from Lockhart/Agos
saying you weren't going back.
Oh, well, that's a mistake.
Uh, it-it must be an old message.
No, I just got it an hour ago.
From who? David Lee?
No, Diane Lockhart.
You...
Diane called you?
Yeah, she was worried I would leave the firm,
and I told her I was keeping my options open.
So she asked me to hold off on calling you for a day or two.
That surprised me, so I'm calling you now.
Uh, Mr. Gallagher, I'm gonna...
have to get back to you, okay?
Of course.
Damn it.
They had no intention of bringing me back.
They never did. They have been playing out
this charade so they can cherry-pick my clients.
Well, even if they are, you can't make it personal.
Sure, I can. I started that firm.
Here. In my home.
We had so few outlets,
we were running cables into Grace's room.
Then hit 'em back. Florrick-Agos--
or whatever they're called now--
they're not the only game in town. You have other options.
I'm officially a scandal, Peter.
You should know that better than anyone.
No one wants a sullied lawyer.
They want a good lawyer,
and you have enough clients to go on your own.
I'm just tired, Peter.
All right, answer me this.
If you went solo,
how many of your clients would follow?
I don't know.
Maybe 20.
Well, that's a pretty good book of business for day one.
Where would I even get the seed money?
Your exit package. Go back in there...
make as if nothing's wrong, just be all smiles,
and then get them to rip up your exit package.
You lost a lot of money on that package, right?
Kalinda.
Dex.
What do you want?
Did you know that Bishop's leaving the business?
What business?
He's, uh... he's worried about being betrayed,
so he's turning evidence.
Where'd you hear that?
Geneva Pine.
The ASA?
She's playing you.
He's doing it for Dylan.
Wants to stay out of jail so he can be a dad.
Look, Pine says there's room
for only one person to turn evidence.
You need to get out of my car.
I came to you because I want to keep my job.
Bishop goes...
you'll be number one.
Hey. If this is some type of a loyalty test from Bishop,
you tell him I said to kiss my ass.
I would never turn on him, ever.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to our concerns.
No problem-- that's why we're here.
And thank you for listening to our concerns.
No problem. Happy to accommodate.
So you would like to renegotiate your exit package?
Mm, no, not renegotiate; rescind.
Ah. Meaning what?
Meaning: since I am returning, it seems more sensible to just...
void it.
Like Alicia never left.
Well, the issue, of course--
and it's an unfortunate one--
is that Alicia's equity is already settled out.
Mm, on the cheap.
Which was understandable at the time,
but Alicia's going to need to be made whole again
if she returns, and rather than waste time
restoring the status quo,
it makes more sense just to keep the status quo,
don't you think?
Well, Alicia, I think all David is saying
is this proposal is a bit of a curveball.
More of a slider, I'd say-- give us a couple of swings,
you can probably still hit it.
No problem. Take all the time you need.
Alicia...
I didn't believe it before, but I think you're right
they're playing you.
Why do you think that?
Because they should've just said no
to rescinding your exit package,
but they delayed.
They're stalling you.
To get my clients?
So what do I do?
Start working the phones fast.
Get your clients on board before they do, because...
they don't want you back.
We want her back, David.
Yes, but if we tear up her exit contract,
she gets all her power back.
First-tier equity package, a seat on the...
What difference does it make? We want her back.
Yes, but on our terms, not hers.
She's a founding member of this firm.
I say we swallow the cost.
And I say you two are burning money
out of a misguided sense of loyalty.
Let's at least run it by the finance committee.
Fine. But let's start calling back Alicia's clients,
assuring them she's staying.
I'm afraid Alicia might get the wrong idea if she heard
that we were calling them before.
You have been a public defender for less than a year, Mr. Bollinger?
Yeah. Ten months.
Oops. Sorry.
I see. And, um...
So how familiar are you with Illinois criminal procedure?
I've been getting up to speed. It's complicated, though.
Looking for Louise's file.
Oh, here it is.
Uh... sorry about the mustard stain.
So, um...
You made the decision not to take issue with the prosecution's
charge of intent to distribute?
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, there's video evidence of her mailing a package
with 26 tabs of Ecstasy.
These are good notes.
Thank you.
Yeah, that's the way Justice Ginsburg liked them.
Justice Ginsburg?
As in, um...
The Supreme Court justice.
Yeah. I clerked with her for a year
before joining the Justice Department.
Look, I-I think you're going to have a hard time
proving ineffective assistance, unfortunately.
I mean, that's what you're going for, right?
I'm incompetent?
No hard feelings, but yeah.
I wish I could have given you something,
but unfortunately, I did a pretty good job at trial.
I mean, if she were a regular street criminal,
you could get her into a probationary program like TASC.
For drug addicts?
Right. She wouldn't see a day of jail.
It's odd-- her having never used drugs is actually worse.
She could get probation if you could prove she's a drug addict.
Unbelievable.
Yeah. I was going to talk
to her presentencing officer about it...
That's a good idea.
I will go do that.
Only in America, right?
You know, you're a grandma, go to jail.
You're a drug addict, go to rehab.
You wonder why people like me are into smaller government.
Oh, yes, that's right-- smaller government
would have no such ironies.
Perhaps there'd be smaller ironies.
Seriously?
That's your experience of life?
Smaller things are purer?
It actually is my experience of life, yeah.
Do you want me to step out?
Stay put.
What I find disgusting is the Republicans
will starve a democracy of funds,
and then complain that society's dysfunctional.
Nobody is starving anybody of anything.
Mr. Gallagher, I wanted to get back to you first.
Diane made a mistake yesterday.
As it turns out...
Alicia Florrick is returning to the fold.
Dear God, you all need to get your stories straight.
I have Alicia right now on the other line,
and she says she's starting her own firm
and she wants me to come with her.
Uh, Jim,
can you give me a moment?
I'll check in with them.
Oh. Uh, David,
do you know Reese Dipple?
Only by reputation.
David Lee, family law.
Very nice to meet you, sir.
Call me R.D.
R.D., simple, American.
I'm a conservative, too, sir.
Really?
Yes. Diane, do you have a minute?
Alicia's playing us.
What do you mean?
She's on the phone, as we speak,
trying to steal James Gallagher away.
She's starting her own firm. Again.
She's dragging this out so we won't pursue her clients.
Meanwhile, she's locking them down.
Then why would she insist on voiding her exit package?
For money.
So she doesn't have to renegotiate her contract
with a gun to her head.
Gallagher just called me-- I got him on hold.
While he's got her on hold.
Uh, Cary.
We need a minute.
Jim, uh, I have Cary Agos
and Diane Lockhart here with me.
We just want to reiterate how much your business means to us.
I appreciate that, but I just want some stability,
do you understand?
Mr. Gallagher,
you say you have Alicia on the other line right now?
Yep.
Why don't you tell her you'll get back to her,
and we will resolve this shortly.
Fine. But I got to tell you, this is starting to get old.
I don't believe it.
That's because the last time
she pulled this crap, you were on her side.
You really want to get into this now?
Stop it. Stop. Alicia's watching.
Dad?
Mr. Bishop?
He must be up.
I'll, uh, wait in the car till he gets back.
Dylan?
Up here.
You're here.
Yeah. I, uh... I didn't want to leave Dylan alone.
Actually, uh... I'm surprised you weren't home.
Why?
Nothing.
I... I just saw Dexter heading out--
I figured you two were together.
Well, I'm here now.
You can go.
Thank you.
Thanks, sir.
Was Dylan downloading music or something?
No.
Somebody used a flash drive to download files.
Can you tell who?
Every time a USB device is connected to a computer,
all the details-- the serial number,
the class of device-- it's all stored in the registry.
So you can trace it?
Yes.
She's stabbing us in the back.
We don't know that yet.
James Gallagher could just...
It's not just Gallagher.
I spoke with Paisley and Tanya Page--
she reached out to both of them, too.
Kalinda, you're just gonna sit there?
Yeah. Alicia would never do this.
She's already done it-- she did it last year,
and she's doing it again.
She had a reason to do it last year.
Oh, how does it feel, Cary, to be betrayed...
David... David, what do you suggest?
That we play coy, string her along in negotiations
until we have a chance to call the rest of her clients
and convince them to stay.
Hey, Dad, I'm home.
Is Kalinda with you?
Uh, yes, sir.
Do you have a minute?
Hey, Jamir.
Why don't you head upstairs? I'll be right up.
I got an "A" in algebra.
I'm proud of you.
When you came to my house,
did you go into my study?
No.
Did you log onto my computer?
No.
You saw Dexter leaving when you drove up.
You said you saw Dexter leaving here when you drove Dylan home.
Look, uh, I don't want to get anyone into trouble.
Why would anybody get into trouble?
I don't know.
Do you still want me to stay, sir?
Yes.
Hey, boss. What you need?
Some information.
Someone used a flash drive to download files from my computer.
Okay.
Flash drives leave their fingerprints behind.
Did you know that?
No.
I didn't either.
This flash drive was given the name
D.R.'s Jams No.2
Uh, boss... I don't know.
I mean, I keep two flash drives in my car,
but they have all my music on 'em and...
I didn't... I mean, I would never...
H-Hold on.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I think you should come over here, Dex.
Dex.
Um, I'll-I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
Do you want anything more from me, sir?
No. Maybe tomorrow.
No problem.
D.R.'s Jams? Who's D.R.?
Dexter Roja.
Why do you have his flash drive?
I took it from his car.
Why?
You have everything you need on that to take Bishop down.
This doesn't come back to me.
And you leave Cary and Diane out of it.
Um, I'm looking for the pre-sentence officer on duty.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
May I help you?
I'm here for Louise Nolfi. I'm her attorney.
Oh. Joy.
No.
I told him it's not true.
Would you like me to return?
No. Sit.
No. I have to go. You tell him it's not true.
All right?
Now...
Uh, it's Louise Nolfi. N-O-L...
Yeah, I know.
You were Cary Agos' attorney,
weren't you?
I was.
And LeMond Bishop's lawyer, too.
Yes.
Okay, this is it. Louise Nolfi.
Possession with intent.
26 tablets of MDMA.
Yes. Unfortunately for this client, that's typical.
She's has quite a high tolerance.
That why I'm talking to you and not her?
Uh, well, Mrs. Nolfi has a...
a serious issue.
No mention of any history of, uh, drug use here.
Well, no, it's not something she advertises.
She has children and grandchildren.
So how soon can she get here?
I beg your pardon?
Drug addiction or not,
I need to evaluate her before I make a recommendation to the court.
Does she really have to come in?
Yeah.
Well, how about tomorrow?
It's unfortunate, but this election scandal
has tainted the Florrick name.
I'm afraid most judges would find themselves
biased against Alicia right now.
Oh, I know,
those allegations were terrible.
Not to mention those e-mails she sent.
So the payment schedule of the exit agreement
was tied to Alicia taking office,
but she never actually took office.
Therefore the exit agreement is, unfortunately, void on its face.
So, um, I'm sorry,
where does that, uh,
leave us?
It seems I'm still partner.
Uh, forgive me, but I think we're gonna need a minute to discuss this.
That bitch.
She's right about the exit deal.
She never took office.
So tell her there's a new capital call.
All partners have to pony up an additional
$250,000 for improvements.
Oh, come on.
It's a ploy, you idiots.
You know, I almost admire her.
We stall her to go after her clients,
so she stalls us to go after ours.
How dare you?
Going after Reese Dipple?
You've never even met him.
Excuse me?
David's been on the phone with every one of your old clients,
and they've all received calls from you.
To tell them I'm coming back.
No, to poach them.
I'm sorry,
are you really accusing me of poaching?
This whole negotiation has been a charade.
You had no intention of bringing me back here.
Because you betrayed us. No, Diane,
because you betrayed me.
Get out of here, Alicia.
Get out of here now.
Lemond Bishop. Chicago PD. You're under arrest.
You got to be kidding me, right? With my son here?
Turn around, please, sir.
Dad.
I'm all right, Dylan.
What do you want me to do, Lemond?
Call my lawyer.
And tell Dexter he's dead.
What is going on, Geneva? What happened?
Cary?
Yes, Cary.
You were getting back to me.
Now I hear Bishop was arrested. What did you do?
I found another way.
You found another way with Kalinda?
Cary, just stay out of this. This has nothing to do with you.
You're gonna get her killed.
It started after my husband died.
I got the shakes.
You know, my hands.
I needed the drugs.
Um, wasn't money tight, Louise?
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.
A friend gave me a couple pills.
Oxycodone.
Roxy, I called them.
That's the street name, when I was on the street.
I see. And where are you getting your supply now?
I have my man.
Down the
on the street.
The street where I live.
Where my man gets me drugs.
I need the drugs.
Uh-huh. Do you find that taking drugs
helps you to avoid or relieve, uh,
withdrawal symptoms?
Oh, yeah, all the time.
I mean, sometimes all I have is my high.
Or I get the shakes.
The. You know.
Okay, thank you,
Ms. Nolfi.
You're welcome.
I mean, just so you know
I want to get this horse off of my back.
Monkey?
What?
Monkey off your back?
No, horse.
Yeah, horse.
Okay, she's not a junkie.
She doesn't fit the cliché, but
I understand that mandatory minimums are unfair, ma'am,
but I cannot recommend that a non-addict be put into rehab.
I'm
sorry.
Where's Kalinda?
She's not here.
Well, I need to leave a message.
Someone turned on Bishop, and it was not me.
She needs to tell Bishop...
It's not her either.
What?
Geneva Pine approached me to turn evidence.
Kalinda wasn't involved. It was me.
It was you? How could it be you?
I gave Pine what I knew.
You did? You...
She was in my car.
Kalinda.
She took it?
Took what?
I'm such an idiot. The flash drive.
She did this?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Tell Kalinda that I need to see her now.
She has nothing to do with this.
You tell her... I need to see her.
Alicia is still a part of this firm.
She was a partner in another firm
and she stole how many clients?
Uh, Chumhum
ring a bell?
Hello?
Alicia?
Uh, do you have a minute?
What, so Diane can cut my exit package again?
Alicia, what the hell's going on?
You tell me.
Diane and David Lee
think you're poaching clients.
They're the ones
who've been stringing me along for days, lying to my clients.
No, no, they-they wanted to bring you back, but then
you called James Gallagher and said you were leaving.
No, no, no, no.
He called me.
Diane went behind my back and told him I was out.
No, she didn't.
Wait...
when did Gallagher say Diane called?
Right after our meeting.
Alicia, Diane called before the meeting,
before she even knew you wanted to come back.
I know 'cause I was there.
She knew I was coming in.
Yes, but she didn't know
why you were coming in.
Well, David Lee
is calling my clients right now.
Because of you. Because of what you did.
So you're saying this is a misunderstanding?
I'm saying that you need to call Diane right now.
How long you been here?
A few hours.
Did you get Bishop arrested?
Cary, don't worry. I, uh...
I handled it.
So you're not in trouble?
No.
Dexter Roja was here.
Wanted your help in figuring out who turned on Bishop.
Oh, that's good.
I said it wasn't you.
Said I was the one who turned on Bishop.
Wh... Why did you do that, Cary?
Didn't want you to get in trouble.
I wasn't in trouble.
He mentioned a flash drive.
He said he just realized
that you were the one who took it from his car.
What's going on, Kalinda?
Nothing.
I know it's something.
When you talk that way, it's always something.
No, no, I... I can take care of it.
You're in trouble.
No.
Can I help you? Please?
No.
Diane?
Do you have a minute? I think we need to talk.
Yes, I think we do.
Grace. Hi.
Is your mom in?
Um, no, she stepped out.
Uh, do you want me to call her for you?
No. Uh, I wanted to talk to her in person.
Um, can I get you anything?
Uh, no, thank you.
Uh, please, have a seat.
Thanks.
Smile.
Diane?
I got your e-mail. What's up?
Yeah, I, um... I took another look at the lab report again.
Louise Nolfi was caught with 26 Ecstasy tablets,
but the price attached to the pills was $500.
So?
So, the street value would be double that.
Either someone's getting a great deal,
or there was a problem with the amount of drugs.
Interesting. We'll talk to the lab tomorrow.
Yeah, you need to call them first thing in the morning.
Uh, I-I won't be in.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Did Alicia call you?
No. She came in.
We apologized to each other.
I'm glad.
Life's too short to be mad.
Well, you're sounding philosophical.
Yeah.
I'll see you, Diane.
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
Take care of yourself, okay?
You, too.
I'm gonna get a snack. You sure you don't want anything?
Yeah. Uh... I have to go now.
Grace...
Would you give this to your mom, please?
Sure.
Just whenever would be great.
Okay.
Bye.
Good-bye.
You're sure of this, Ms. Lockhart?
I am, Your Honor.
I personally inspected the evidence this morning,
and here is an affidavit from the custodian at the lab.
The charge says that Mrs. Nolfi was caught
with 26 tablets of Ecstasy.
But in fact, the tablets had been cut in half, which means
that there were really only 13 tablets in the package.
And the threshold number for the mandatory minimum to apply is...
15 tablets, Your Honor.
Then it is my pleasure to inform you, Mrs. Nolfi,
that I am finding you guilty of possession
of only 13 tablets of Ecstasy,
and therefore, will be sentencing you
to six months probation,
which will hereby be deemed... served.
We need to bring Alicia on board.
Alicia came by last night and apologized.
Because we have her by the throat.
No, I apologized, too. It was all a misunderstanding.
Good.
Then we should bring her back.
No, you shouldn't.
Mr. Dipple, I'm sorry, but
if you could give us a minute,
we have an urgent personnel matter to resolve.
You resolve away. But for what it's worth,
if Alicia Florrick returns, I will be moving on.
Had the conversation with Diane this morning.
What?
I may not see eye-to-eye with all y'all
when it comes to politics.
Worry not, sir.
You and I are on the same page.
But I do value integrity.
Yes, and no one has more than Alicia.
Mr. Agos, I am scrutinized heavily--
by the press, bloggers of every stripe.
Now, I can deal with the scandal that Diane's involved with,
but I do have my limits.
Look, Alicia did nothing wrong.
You and I both know that doesn't matter.
The Florrick name?
It's like George Ryan or Blagojevich.
It's just another in a long line of corrupt Chicago pols.
I'm sorry,

Excuse me. Mr. Agos?
No answer from Kalinda. She's not in today.
Did you try her at home?
Yeah, it just kept ringing.
Did you try her on her cell?
No.
I'm sorry.
The number you have reached is not in service.
Kalinda?
Who called you?
Diane.
Wow. Well, that's payback
for dropping her as Supreme Court justice.
No. It isn't.
Well, screw 'em. Start your own firm.
I don't have any clients.
Call your old clients, and just tell them...
I did.
No one wants to stay.
I mean, Colin Sweeney, but...
I'm damaged goods.
Listen...
Give it time.
Look at me. A year after jail, I was back in the S.A.'s office.
I'm tired, Peter.
It's okay. Be tired.
Rest, read a book.
Recharge the batteries.
Eli was talking about getting a ghostwriter.
I think you should write a book.
About?
You. Your story, your political philosophy.
People are interested.
They're more interested in you than me.
You can do it, Alicia.
You can come back from this.
I know it.
