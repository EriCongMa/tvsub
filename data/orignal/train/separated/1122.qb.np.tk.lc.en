noel kahn is a.
noel .
&quot; i see you . &quot;
it means somebody saw us last night .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
the bank loan came through .
in a lasagna box ?
it is a loan . unauthorized .
i &apos;m gay .
this is completely wrong , and you know it .
she is struggling with this . i can see it .
i know you want to kiss me .
is there , uh , anything you can tell me about what you see ?
i think she &apos;s talking to the older boy .
so @-@ called , uh , mystery boyfriend ?
&quot; alison loves ian &quot; ?
we &apos;re married .
you &apos;re what ?
isn &apos;t hilton head in south carolina ?
i thought your grandma lived in georgia .
it &apos;s still the south , spence .
why so many questions ?
he &apos;s got a lot of stuff , ian .
yeah . suddenly he &apos;s , uh , everywhere .
is someone there ?
melissa , no one could have heard us .
morning .
you okay ? you seem a little jumpy .
yeah . you surprised me , that &apos;s all .
i just didn &apos;t know you were back .
yeah , we didn &apos;t-- we didn &apos;t wake you last night ?
i mean , you didn &apos;t hear us ?
no . like i said , i didn &apos;t even know you were back .
so , is this all going in the barn ?
have you seen your sister &apos;s wardrobe ?
no , the movers are coming on friday .
we &apos;re going to move it to our place in philly .
listen , spence , um ...
i know our decision to get married was sudden ,
and ... yeah , i get that it &apos;s thrown you ,
but ... you know , we &apos;re family now .
i hope you start thinking of me like that .
so , how was the honeymoon ?
oh , it &apos;s perfect .
no golf for the newlyweds ?
well , you know , we spent most of our time indoors .
h @-@ have you ever played here ?
what , hilton head ?
yeah .
alison went to a tournament there with her grandmother .
really ?
uh @-@ huh . she disappeared the night she got home .
is it a nice course ?
uh , yeah , from what i remember ,
but it was years ago .
&apos;morning .
ah . good morning .
okay , go ahead , you can say it out loud--
&quot; dad has gotten the hang of this single parent thing . &quot;
it looks good .
yeah .
did you see mom last night ?
yes , i did .
how &apos;d it go ?
well ...
what i thought was going to be a date with your mom
turned into your mom
telling me that she &apos;s dating ... other people .
what ?
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
it &apos;s not really my place to tell her that she can &apos;t .
that &apos;s just so you , dad .
you lie and cheat ,
but you draw the line at hypocrisy .
you &apos;re such a role model .
mike !
hi . i &apos;m plannin &apos; a surprise visit
for my husband , and he cannot stop talkin&apos;
about the room he had on his last visit .
can you pull up that reservation ?
his name is ian thomas .
why are you doing this ?
i think ian and alison were together
the weekend before she disappeared .
do you remember how alison was acting
when she got home from visiting her grandmother ?
all giggles and tan ?
yeah .
alie hated old people ,
and alie &apos;s grandmother lives in georgia .
hilton head is in south carolina .
she was lying to us .
so what ?
alison lied more than she breathed .
you think that was enough
to make ian want her to permanently shut her up ?
i thought you &apos;d be happy to hear it was anybody but toby .
all toby wanted was for me to believe him ,
and i didn &apos;t .
toby lied about a lot of things too , em .
if lying was a crime , we would all be in jail .
agent cooper . good morning .
hi .
beautiful day , huh ?
thanks for driving me .
hanna , i &apos;m your mother .
since when do you thank me for taking you anywhere ?
i feel guilty , okay ?
and i can &apos;t stop thinking about the money .
i &apos;d feel better if you &apos;d yell at me .
well , if i thought it would bring back the cash .
so , are we totally broke again ?
not totally . no .
thank you , god , i already used some of the money
to get us out of debt .
the plan was to invest the rest .
so i could replace it all
before anyone realized it was gone .
well , if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan ,
that &apos;s ... it &apos;s like a felony , right ?
it &apos;s only a felony if they find out .
looks like someone traded in her wheels for heels .
they &apos;re flats , but they are ferragamos .
thank you .
the food in this town is to die for .
i &apos;m missing it already .
are you going somewhere ?
came here to find the person that killed your friend .
toby cavanaugh may be out on bail ,
but he &apos;s not leaving town ,
and we have a solid case against him .
so , unless you have a reason for me to stay ...
well , i guess we &apos;ll see you around , then .
you girls take care .
bye .
what ?
ian was definitely at hilton head
the same weekend alie was .
maybe we do have a reason for cooper to stay .
agent cooper is not some small @-@ town cop
that &apos;s going to arrest spencer &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law
because alie carved his name into a tree .
yeah , a tree that &apos;s no longer there .
no one knows that but us . and ian .
and &quot; a. &quot;
noel led us to that tree for a reason .
is &quot; a ... &quot;
i mean , is noel trying to help us
find alie &apos;s killer ?
&quot; a &quot; helping us ?
wow , that &apos;s a first .
how could noel even know about ian and alie ?
have you ever noticed how noel is always around ?
are they friends ?
no .
hanna &apos;s right about cooper .
we need to find some kind of proof .
thank you , veronica mars .
that proof may be boxed in your kitchen .
hi .
hey .
are we still on till later ?
you know , now that your dad &apos;s gone ?
yeah , my mom knows how my dad feels about us .
in other words , he &apos;ll tolerate me .
she &apos;s spending the day in the city ,
so you &apos;ll be safe , i promise .
what &apos;s later ?
um , studying .
is that girl @-@ on @-@ girl code for romance ?
no , hanna , we &apos;re actually studying .
but your friend is a romantic .
is she ?
oh , yeah . um ... walks in the rain ,
picnics by the lake , dancing naked in candlelight .
i &apos;m just kidding .
we go to dinner and a movie , just like you guys .
well , she &apos;s not entirely kidding .
emily would love to do all of those things .
okay , you &apos;ve shared enough .
nice vest .
this is your teacher look , right ?
i &apos;m an observant guy . i see things other people may not notice .
your point is ?
aria told me that you might have misunderstood
our previous conversation , about my disappointing grade .
it &apos;s sweet how close you two are .
what do you want ?
i want to make this easy for you .
this is a brand @-@ new paper ,
and , trust me , it &apos;s worthy of an &quot; a. &quot;
yeah , this is the same essay .
you just reprinted it .
well , last time we talked , i wanted the &quot; a. &quot;
this time i need it ,
or i don &apos;t get to suit up for friday &apos;s game .
it &apos;s a few strokes of a pen . why is it so hard for you ?
if you have to ask the question ,
you wouldn &apos;t understand my answer .
what are you doing here , kahn ?
i was looking for aria montgomery .
she &apos;s got first period here , right ?
so , are you two still hooking up ?
the thing about aria is , she &apos;s way into older guys .
give me the paper . i can reread it today .
i knew you &apos;d do the right thing .
do you want to grab a coffee after school ?
i could use a study buddy .
i would , but i have physical therapy .
hey , i just heard that toby &apos;s here .
would they let him come back to school ?
hey , freak coming through !
back off . get to class .
step back .
murderer .
step aside , please .
let &apos;s go .
oink . oink .
i understand .
poor hanna .
you don &apos;t have to feel this way .
i can show you how to get rid of it .
do you like that ?
that &apos;s not fair .
emily !
mom ! what are you doing ?
i won &apos;t live like this .
like what ? i @-@ i thought you were gonna be out .
and that gives you permission ... ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t even imagine where this was headed .
pam , i promise we were studying . that &apos;s all .
mrs. fields . i am mrs. fields to you .
i think i should go .
i &apos;m so sorry , maya .
it &apos;s okay . you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
for the first time in my life ,
i am ashamed that you &apos;re my mother .
hanna ?
hey , are you okay ?
oink . oink .
don &apos;t you guys have practice ,
or did you lose your balls ?
i thought you had physical therapy .
i lied .
do you want to talk about it ?
i wish i could .
i really hate &quot; a. &quot;
he has something on my mom
that can get her into a lot of trouble .
what does he want you to do ?
remember when i used to eat
when i got nervous or felt bad ?
alison ...
walked in on me after a binge , and ...
she was actually kind .
or so i thought .
she helped me throw up .
hanna ...
that &apos;s so dangerous .
i know , and ...
that was just such a low point in my life that ...
i started taking better care of myself .
i knew i could be stronger than that .
yeah , and you are .
he is such a bitch .
hey . you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay .
did you take another look at my paper ?
yes .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s the grade you earned .
do you know what this means ?
hey , i &apos;m talking to you !
i know exactly what it means .
oh , my gosh , this is amazing !
why don &apos;t you save us the cost of a trial and drop dead !
ice cream is so good .
we need to talk .
your friend left her backpack here .
i returned it to her parents .
are you doing drugs with her ?
is that what this whole thing is about ?
what are you talking about ?
are you stoned ?
no !
look , honey , i want you to know this has nothing to do with her being a girl .
if it were a boy ...
you wouldn &apos;t have gone through his things .
are you lying to yourself or me ?
i don &apos;t even know who you are anymore !
you &apos;re right about that !
you &apos;re no longer allowed to see her .
you can &apos;t do that .
watch me .
this doesn &apos;t change the way i feel about her !
don &apos;t bother calling your father .
he &apos;s as disappointed in you as i am .
hey , dinner &apos;s almost ready .
i &apos;m not hungry .
all right , listen i &apos;ve got to take this call ,
but then we are all sitting down at this table
and having dinner as a family .
so what were you and noel kahn talking about today ?
what do you mean ?
i saw you with him at school this morning .
yeah . so ?
so are you guys , like , friends now or something ?
we hang out a little .
since when ?
i don &apos;t know .
a while . why ?
has he asked you anything about me ?
about mom and dad ? have you told him anything ?
uh ... like what ?
look , noel , he &apos;s not who you think he is .
okay , he &apos;s not your friend .
jealous much ?
stupid much ?
i &apos;m serious , mike .
aria , it was nothing .
just telling me about some stupid rumor he had heard .
what-- what kind of rumor ?
well , supposably , um , the english teacher--
you know , the one that you think is so great ? --
is having a thing with one of his students .
that &apos;s not funny , mike .
accusations like that can ruin someone &apos;s life .
i &apos;m not making a joke .
noel swears that he saw them together ,
and he feels terrible for the girl , but ...
you know , tomorrow he &apos;s gonna tell the principal .
aria ...
have you heard anything about this ?
dad ...
i &apos;ve totally screwed up .
i promised spencer that i &apos;d study at her place tonight .
we &apos;ve got this huge midterm tomorrow .
she &apos;s totally gonna kill me .
so , are we gonna eat , or what ?
what happened today ?
it &apos;s over , aria .
the hiding , the sneaking around .
it-- it &apos;s over .
wait , ezra .
no , come on , you-- you have to tell me what happened .
what you and i have ...
is the most real and honest thing in my life .
and that &apos;s something i hope you remember .
no matter what happens tomorrow , that won &apos;t change .
i know how you feel about me .
i &apos;m not gonna change noel &apos;s grade ,
and i will not let him hurt you .
if i resign tomorrow and get the hell out of rosewood ,
he &apos;ll have no reason to tell anybody about us .
hey , even though this doesn &apos;t look right ,
it has always felt right ,
and i will not let him
change this into something that feels wrong .
i just can &apos;t .
can &apos;t .
i love you .
ready for midterms ?
not yet .
maybe you can take a break tomorrow night .
ian and i are treating mom and dad to dinner .
i &apos;d like it if you came .
yeah , i &apos;ll try , but ...
do you need help ?
an ovulation kit ?
you weren &apos;t supposed to see that .
but i did .
can you keep a secret ?
of course .
i mean it .
this is not something i &apos;m prepared to tell mom and dad .
okay .
i &apos;m trying to get pregnant .
with ian ?
of course .
wh @-@ why the rush ?
we want a big family ,
and i don &apos;t want to be a grandma when my kids are in high school .
i &apos;ve never once heard you say you wanted a big family .
well , we &apos;ve never talked about it , have we ?
what about wharton ?
you &apos;ve worked so hard to get in .
i &apos;ll get my mba , but ...
i don &apos;t feel like i need to be the best and the first anymore .
all those things that used to matter just ...
don &apos;t seem that important .
those things were everything for you .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
when i was your age ,
i wanted everything you want .
you wanted those things last week .
i &apos;m happy , spencer . i really am .
okay .
so getting pregnant is your idea ,
not ian &apos;s ?
yes .
don &apos;t you love the thought of a little &quot; mini @-@ me &quot;
or &quot; mini @-@ ian &quot; running around ?
not really .
melissa !
i @-@ i thought this was something we were gonna keep private .
i know , but i just--
i
looked in the bag before she could even stop me .
i promise , i won &apos;t tell anyone .
trust me , spencer can keep a secret .
yeah , i know she can .
hey . when did you get home ?
uh , just now .
what are you doing with that ?
i &apos;m going to cook it .
for dinner ?
yep .
hanna .
mom .
i know when you &apos;re being dishonest with me
even before you start talking .
you do ?
uh @-@ huh .
spill it .
where did that money come from ?
how do you know when i &apos;m being
dishonest with you before i even start talking ?
i &apos;m waiting .
more wine ?
hanna .
what did you do to get this money ?
i found it in the bathroom , at lucky leon &apos;s .
really ?
really .
and it didn &apos;t occur to you to turn it in to the manager ?
no , it didn &apos;t .
find a better place to hide it .
hey , mom .
hm ?
how do you know when i &apos;m lying ?
oh , i &apos;m not giving that up .
oh , come on .
nope .
fine . i &apos;ll figure it out on my own .
good luck with that .
i am still a virgin .
i am not a virgin .
no , i &apos;ll just borrow something of spencer &apos;s .
yeah , her-- her parents are here . they know i &apos;m staying over .
okay . good night , dad .
okay , that i won &apos;t let you do .
what ?
look at me like ...
this might be the last time you see me .
melissa pregnant ?
hey , i said this was a secret .
no , it &apos;s not a secret .
it &apos;s a bombshell ,
like in &quot; nuke @-@ u @-@ lar . &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; nuclear . &quot;
&quot; nuke @-@ le @-@ ar . &quot;
okay , whatever . it &apos;s still a disaster movie .
i know .
can you imagine melissa pregnant ?
or even worse , melissa as a mom ?
i &apos;ve never once heard melissa talk about kids .
now she wants to have this huge family ?
he &apos;s totally manipulating her .
manipulating her ?
spence , your sister &apos;s a bad @-@ ass .
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re gonna find ,
but i have to see what &apos;s inside those boxes .
emily ?
hey .
i didn &apos;t even get to say goodbye .
to who ?
maya .
em , where is she going ?
they &apos;re sending her to juvie camp ,
for three months .
what happened ?
my mother .
that &apos;s what happened .
step aside , please .
somebody set me up , okay ?
you &apos;ll have to explain this one , mr. kahn .
you have to believe me .
you stole the answers to three midterms ,
mr. kahn .
i can &apos;t imagine ever believing in you again .
this is really unacceptable ,
and i &apos;m really , really disappointed in you .
&#91; 这两个单词都是a开头 &#93;
i don &apos;t know who are more afraid of .
&quot; a &quot; the bitch who tried to flatten hanna , of--
or &quot; a &quot; our new &quot; frien @-@ emy . &quot;
what ?
&quot; a &quot; saved my relationship .
yeah , well , &quot; a &quot; tried to kill me .
because &quot; a &quot; thought you saw her .
&quot; a &quot; clearly knows now that you didn &apos;t .
so , the law of cosines is an extension of
the pythagorean theorem to the arbitrary angles ...
uh , english , please .
it &apos;s nice to see the posse together again .
the posse ?
this is me playing nice , aria .
spencer and i have called a truce .
oh , well , i &apos;ll play along .
how does it feel to be married ?
it feels like ...
i don &apos;t have to try so hard all the time ,
like things are settled .
yeah . that &apos;s how my mom felt
before my dad met isabelle .
one thing i don &apos;t need to worry about
is ian looking at other women .
you ready , wife ?
i am , my handsome husband .
bye .
what ?
there is something that i need to show you , in my room .
wait , no .
i think she should find it herself .
i agree , but first ...
there .
now you can go .
go . go .
i thought you were gone !
i &apos;m leaving in the morning .
i &apos;m so sorry , maya .
this is all my fault .
don &apos;t say that . it &apos;s not true .
i &apos;ve left you , like , a hundred messages .
and when you didn &apos;t call me back ,
i thought that you were mad at me .
my parents blocked my phone .
how did you get here ?
i &apos;d say it took a village ...
and a very tall ladder .
hey .
look at this .
everyone kept that .
what &apos;s this ?
you guys , look . really ?
it &apos;s fine .
you know , i am officially jealous of emily &apos;s love life .
we &apos;ve got comic books , more comic books ,
and ... more comic books .
evidence of geekdom , but not a crime .
thank you guys so much .
thank you .
of course .
you &apos;ll be back soon .
i don &apos;t even know how to thank you guys .
tonight was the best gift anyone could have ever given me .
where are they sending her ?
someplace called true north .
seriously ?
is it bad ?
they sent betsy berger there for huffing spray paint .
she came back as a drummer in a gospel band .
maya &apos;s an amazing person , em .
she &apos;s-- she &apos;s gonna be fine .
yeah .
did you guys find anything ?
we &apos;ve looked through every box
and found a big , fat nothing .
&quot; don &apos;t say i never gave you anything .
turn on your computer .
a. &apos; &quot;
if the girls knew i was seeing you ,
oh , my god , they &apos;d never shut up about it .
this is the video cooper showed us .
i wish they were more mature , but ...
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
i have to get back before they wake up .
i know you want to kiss me .
oh , my god !
come closer .
do you see anything ?
my torch dies .
let &apos;s go back
