gossip girl here .
you one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
someone set tripp up to look like a hero .
who ?
this couldn &apos;t have worked better .
my husband is a congress man .
i had a crush on him .
now i don &apos;t know if i can trust myself around him .
something happend at the night of the sheperd
go out the way what happened that night ?
i think we got a solid 14 out of 15 .
i am not going with just one more to go .
as a famed literary liar once told oprah ,
memory is subjective .
top of the morning .
up top . yeah , there it is .
memories can be embellished or denied .
hey , blair . i don &apos;t know what you think you saw
between me and tripp , but nothing is happening .
but as james frey knows all too well ...
the truth always comes out .
this is my 30th message .
i don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
please call me .
here comes message 31 .
ugh . i don &apos;t converse with liars or lewinskys .
come on . blair . you don &apos;t know that you saw anything .
in the second grade , i saw our gym teacher
giving laverne glazer &apos;s mom the glad eye .
not only did it earn me the first &quot; a + + &quot; for gym
in constance history ,
i learned that my sexual tension radar is unparalleled .
point ceded .
so is beatnik back ?
ew . no .
i &apos;m adding new recruits to my student army .
apparently at n.y.u. , no one cares
if your forefathers made pumpkin pie at plymouth .
they only care if they made profits at paramount .
tisch kids .
spawn of moguls and movie stars .
yesterday i sent a first edition &quot; no exit &quot; script
to their leader , paul hoffman .
today i &apos;ll secure the alliance . care to tag along ?
oh , i &apos;d love to , but a high @-@ ranking diplomat
has asked me to show his son around new york .
i need to build up my continental clientele ,
so it looks like i &apos;m statue of liberty @-@ bound .
oh , the sacrifices we make for success .
i &apos;ll think of a way to make your day less boring later .
what , a threesome ?
oh , yeah . just me , olivia , vanessa ...
two girls , four boobs and one dan humphrey .
how awesome am i ?
oh , how stupid can you be ?
what ?
buddy , okay , i know things . i @-@ i &apos;ve been to europe .
chuck bass is my best friend .
yeah .
all right , the third person is supposed to be a stranger .
no , the fact that it was vanessa is what made it so fun .
okay , the problem is during the threesome
there &apos;s always a twosome and a onesome going on .
you know what ? the onesome was not so bad .
okay , you may have enjoyed the show ,
but let &apos;s face it , vanessa ... is very vocal .
it couldn &apos;t have been easy for olivia to hear all that .
no . you know what we do is fine .
we talked the next morning . and so is vanessa .
i mean , i haven &apos;t really seen her much , but , uh ,
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure she is . why are you being such a buzzkill ?
because you &apos;re lucky to have of them in your life .
all right ? not only do i not have a girlfriend ,
ever since serena and i stopped speaking ,
i don &apos;t even have a girl friend either .
you had both , and you blew it .
i did not . i did not .
okay . okay .
in fact , you know what ? there she is ,
my still best friend .
ah , perfect .
abrams .
hey , dan . i &apos;ve barely seen you this week .
i feel like you &apos;ve been avoiding me since ...
no . no , not at all . uh , tonight at the bowery ...
i think morrissey is playing .
so you want to go , just the two of us , for old times &apos; sake ?
yeah , i &apos;d love it .
so i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
yeah , of course . yeah . sorry .
well , it didn &apos;t seem awkward at all .
everything is ... it &apos;s fine . it really is .
give me a call if you need me , which you will .
mm .
gaga &apos;s a tisch alumni .
even if she doesn &apos;t want to give a secret concert
are you guys talking about lady gaga ?
no , blair .
i &apos;m talking about gaga ahmadinejad , first lady of iran .
that &apos;s funny .
you know who likes sarcasm ?
my stepfather , cyrus rose ,
big @-@ time entertainment lawyer .
maybe he could talk her into doing a show .
uh , blair , we all know who my father is ,
and this girl here is willa weinstein .
if our fathers can &apos;t help us ,
i doubt cyrus rose , whom i &apos;ve never heard of , can .
what are you guys doing for cabaret tonight ?
fairy @-@ tale theme is hard . don &apos;t want to be trite .
cabaret ? i love cabaret ... and fairy tales .
princesses , queens ...
uh , sorry , blair .
it &apos;s my cabaret , and it &apos;s by invitation only .
all the spots are filled by ... serious theater students .
i don &apos;t care how much money they &apos;re offering .
k.c. , &quot; bitches of eastwick &quot; is a terrible idea .
it &apos;s like &quot; heathers , &quot; but with witches .
i ... ever since &quot; e.k.4 &quot; isn &apos;t happening ,
she &apos;s literally pushing me to take anything .
yeah , well , i thought ... well , i &apos;d hoped
that you &apos;d , uh , you &apos;d stick around now .
well , that &apos;s my plan .
i &apos;m so happy here ,
you know , with my classes , and i have you .
and vanessa .
and vanessa .
and if i want to act , i can do it here at n.y.u. ,
you know , with the best theater department
in the whole country .
yeah , you know , speaking of tisch
um , tell me if i &apos;m crazy .
but i was thinking of applying to the , uh ,
playwriting program for next year .
dan , i don &apos;t think that is crazy at all .
i would have to write a play by this christmas break .
well , i &apos;ll help you with your application tonight .
i would love that , but , uh , tonight vanessa and i
gonna go see morrissey at the bowery .
it &apos;s a tradition we &apos;ve had since seventh grade .
you know , we wear tight shirts ,
we through gladiolus on stage .
um , it &apos;s okay , right ?
yes , of course . it &apos;s tradition .
i &apos;m gonna go grab a coffee , okay ?
i &apos;ll see you later .
okay , uh ...
i thought we were gonna grab coffee together .
what about brad alexander ?
his mother said he &apos;s single .
uh , yeah , &apos; cause he gave six girls from nightingale
the gonorrhea of the throat last year .
what are you two doing ? oh ,
we &apos;re trying to find jenny a date
for the horticultural society gala .
don &apos;t worry , dad . i &apos;m over upper east side guys .
i &apos;m looking to expand my horizons .
i &apos;ll be just a minute .
charles , how are you ?
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
thanks , but i &apos;m on my way to the planetarium .
i was just dropping off those papers you needed .
thank you .
did chuck bass just say he was going to planetarium ?
mm @-@ hmm . i &apos;m entertaining a hotel guest ,
the son of an ambassador .
he &apos;s waiting in the foyer .
well , maybe jenny could show him around .
you did say you wanted to expand your horizons .
yeah .
i can do it .
but you owe me .
with pleasure .
what is gonorrhea of the throat ?
olivia .
just the starlet i was hoping to find .
hi , blair .
uh , dorota need to use my outlet
for your towel warmer again ?
actually , i have a question .
how do i win over shallow , superficial actors ?
calling them &quot; shallow &quot; and &quot; superficial &quot; didn &apos;t work ?
i &apos;m serious . they &apos;re all doing this cabaret thing tonight .
i wasn &apos;t even invited . not that i have anything to perform .
well , you &apos;re in luck . i @-@ i was invited .
i guess being a movie star has a certain cache .
i may have read that at the dentist .
more importantly , i am dating a guy
who needs an opportunity to write a play .
he &apos;ll just need to clear his schedule first .
hey . tripp .
uh , how are you ?
i was , uh , just leaving you a note
about the , uh , &quot; observer &quot; article .
oh . great .
i thought you wouldn &apos;t be here ,
which is what it said on your schedule .
right . um , my meeting ended early .
good .
yeah .
then you &apos;ll have time to read my note .
you know , this , um , this really shouldn &apos;t be so awkward .
it won &apos;t be for too long .
big move to d.c. tomorrow .
i thought that wasn &apos;t until january .
maureen wanted to be there for the holidays ...
the parties , the networking .
it &apos;s probably for the best , though .
i &apos;ve been pretty ...
distracted .
yeah , tell me about it .
uh , last week ...
nothing happened .
then why does it feel like it did ?
maybe we should just , uh ...
avoid each other until you leave .
yeah .
there you two are .
honey . i just found out they had to move
the freshman spouses luncheon .
um , so i &apos;d have to leave in an hour .
is that okay ?
yes , of course .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
i &apos;ll just have jeanne finish packing .
but all that &apos;s left is the home office .
serena should help you .
there &apos;s some private family stuff , and i trust you .
that &apos;s not really in serena &apos;s job description .
she doesn &apos;t mind . do you ?
now who wants to take their favorite wife to brunch ?
don &apos;t forget yourself , congressman .
your marriage could wind up in &quot; a million little pieces . &quot;
mom , i know how much you love grandfather . and i get it .
it &apos;s not like i haven &apos;t forgiven my father a few times .
but do not let him manipulate you .
he was the one behind the hudson thing .
who else could it be ?
hello , nate ?
i &apos;m sorry . mom ?
yeah , i &apos;d love to hear your new information ,
but , um , listen , i gotta go .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
i know i &apos;m not your favorite person right now ,
but it &apos;s me , nate ,
and there &apos;s no one else i can talk to about this .
i , i think i may be about to get involved with a married man .
why am i the only one you can talk to ?
because it &apos;s tripp .
vanessa , hey .
hey . i figured you &apos;d be back
to get some clean clothes at some point .
yeah
i know , we &apos;ve barely seen each other .
dan and i have just been busy , you know ?
so ... you &apos;re not ...
avoiding me because of the whole ...
what ? oh , my god .
uh , no . i ... come on .
no .
okay , great , because i was totally freaking out
before i ran into dan this morning .
but he was the same old dan .
you know , tonight we &apos;re going to , like ,
our fifth morrissey show ,
and i still have tickets from
our one when we &apos;re seventh grade .
um , actually ...
i feel really bad about that .
um , a month ago , i signed dan and me up
for the bleecker in cabaret , and it &apos;s tonight .
um , we would totally blow it off ,
but dan wants to apply to tisch ,
and it &apos;s just really great exposure for him .
oh , yeah .
okay .
sorry about morrissey .
i just don &apos;t get it . i mean , tripp ? really ?
two months ago , you were all over carter baizen .
tripp has sacrificed so much to get where he is .
i mean , we all have . he can &apos;t just throw it away for you .
yeah , and he &apos;s fighting it , and so am i.
i can literally feel my heart thump when i see him .
i haven &apos;t felt this way since i was 13,
with jude law in &quot; alfie . &quot;
yeah , well , you &apos;re not 13 anymore , serena .
you know , i thought that , whatever happened between us
i could still count on you ,
but i guess i was wrong .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
you can count on me , always .
so , belgium , huh ?
i bet they have really good waffles .
my family &apos;s really into waffles .
yeah , i &apos;ve barely teste them ,
we left when i was 4 so my father could work
on the oslo accord .
he worked on the oslo accord ? that &apos;s major .
yeah , clearly more major than being a father , but ...
right .
so , uh , what do you want to do ?
there &apos;s the boat for lunch ,
or we could walk on over to jean georges .
you know , i have a plan .
it &apos;ll be fun .
oh , my god . don &apos;t look now ,
but those are the champion mean girls .
hi .
they &apos;re gonna die of jealousy .
toy sailboats ?
really ?
come on . it might be cool in belgium ,
but in manhattan , only little kids do that .
you have eight hours to write and rehearse
your reimagined fairy tale before tech .
lots of tisch faculty and alumnis will be there ,
plus my legit agent .
so , please , don &apos;t embarrass me .
good luck .
see ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
this is gonna be a great opportunity .
all right , so which fairy tale do you think i should
totally &quot; snow white . &quot;
sorry i &apos;m late .
uh , uh , what ?
what is she doing here ?
silly . i &apos;m the producer ,
costar and director .
yeah , it was ... it was her idea , actually .
my brilliant idea .
a musical featuring the songs of tisch alumna lady gaga .
paul loves his gaga .
i &apos;m gonna go pick his brain
about what songs he &apos;d think work best thematically .
okay .
what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on here ?
you want me to cancel on vanessa ,
who &apos;s gonna be justifiably furious ,
to ... to write a &quot; snow white &quot; / lady gaga musical
to be directed by blair waldorf ?
listen , i know that her idea
is ... is kind of out of the box , but if you pull this off ,
everyone &apos;s gonna be talking about it .
and i talked to vanessa . she &apos;s totally cool about tonight .
wait . s @-@ so you already told her ?
i @-@ i ran into her in ... in our room ,
and she was fine . i promise .
leave a message , and i might listen to it .
chuck , could you find another way to drum up business ?
because this belgian bore has been playing in the park
for the past half @-@ hour with his dinghy . i have a reputation .
all right . all set .
what now ? balloon animals ?
by the way , you took the wrong boat .
uh , no . actually , this is , uh , the one with the cash .
mine had the &quot; e &quot; in it .
what ?
sorry if i was boring you . you still want to get some lunch
and we can go find those , uh , chapin girls ?
okay , man , so ... so get this .
i had plans with vanessa tonight
right ? but then olivia signed me up
to do this cabaret thing with her and blair .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s post
threesome stage one , if not both girls ,
try to prove to the other who you belong to .
all right , so what do i do ?
oh , you gotta prove to olivia
that you and vanessa are still just friends ,
despite the fact that you &apos;ve seen each other &apos;s business .
you good ?
yeah , thanks , man .
all right , later .
oh . dan . girl problems .
you don &apos;t even want to know .
it sounds like you &apos;re everyone &apos;s therapist today .
yeah , well , affairs with married people , love triangles ...
just so happens everyone &apos;s problems are
well within my area of expertise .
okay , you ready ?
serena , hey .
uh , what do you like on your pizza ?
actually , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not coming over .
i had a feeling you &apos;d call .
i can &apos;t say i &apos;m not disappointed , though .
come on , tripp .
you know it &apos;s not a good idea for us to be alone all night .
no , you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t want to go without saying good @-@ bye .
could we maybe just get some lunch ?
lunch ? yeah . i ... you know , i ...
um ... i actually don &apos;t think that i can .
but travel safe , congressman . bye .
good work . i &apos;m gonna be here to keep you strong .
until tripp leaves , i &apos;m not gonna let you out of my sight .
mr. van der bilt , mrs. archibald is here to see you .
my aunt ? i &apos;m kind of busy . can she come back later ?
no , she said it was important .
i thought you had a play to write .
listen , i &apos;m sorry about morrissey
but i told olivia this morning that i wanted to apply tisch
and so she saw this cabaret thing , and she signed us up .
wait . this morning ?
yeah . it had nothing to do with our plans tonight .
i mean , this is ... it &apos;s a big opportunity for me .
of course .
yeah , so , um , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna need your help .
inspired by miss gaga &apos;s lyrics ,
i &apos;ve written a satirical commentary
about fame , glamour
and our society &apos;s obsession with the shiny new thing .
humphrey , i &apos;m surprised . this isn &apos;t horrible .
you play the aging queen , a fading but talented rock star
who &apos;s earned her success .
olivia ... snow white , a young up @-@ and @-@ comer who &apos;s trying
to steal the queen &apos;s thunder
by being outrageous and sexy .
i like it .
yeah . uh , amalia , sophie , twins ...
you &apos;re the struggling dwarf boy band .
i &apos;ll be prince of charming records ,
trying to find his next big pop star . so i , you know ,
i think it , uh , i think it kinda works .
don &apos;t get too cocky , humphrey
we still have your subpar acting to deal with .
let &apos;s meet back here in a half an hour .
everyone off book so i can block .
actually , i &apos;ve found a more experienced director
more suited to the project .
julie taymor ?
close .
no .
vanessa ?
v. , i am so stupid for not thinking of you earlier .
we &apos;re so lucky to have you
to bring dan &apos;s amazing words to life .
wait until you read this .
i already did .
dan always shows me when he just finished his work .
you know , i had to get her onboard , show her somethin &apos; .
great . well , if you need any pointers ,
i &apos;ve worked with some of the world &apos;s best directors .
sure , if i want to turn anyone into a bat .
i &apos;ll , you know . thank you .
dan ?
yeah ?
when girls live together ,
sometimes their cycles sync up .
no hormones , not yours or theirs
will get in the way of my cabaret .
it &apos;ll be fine , blair .
what exactly does an upper east side queen do ?
you wear designer clothes
and boss people around ?
no .
i go to parties and openings and stuff .
where you wear designer clothes and boss people around .
sounds like kind of a yawn .
well , yeah ,
i guess compared to being an international drug dealer .
what &apos;s the deal with that anyway ?
i mean , you don &apos;t need the money .
your dad &apos;s an ambassador , right ?
exactly ,
which means we don &apos;t have go through customes .
they don &apos;t search our bags
when we come in from the hague .
besides of the added satisfaction of knowing
my father would have to suffer if i were ever caught .
a little bit of danger is what makes life worth living ,
and you had your very first taste today , queen jenny .
it was kind of thrilling .
if you mean that , some friends gonna make me
a little later to refuel my boat .
you in ?
high school was so much easier .
yeah , in some ways .
well , i wasn &apos;t attracted to married men .
yeah , but i was .
well , not men , obviously .
lady catherine , that was my first experience ,
being someone &apos;s fake girlfriend .
who knew i &apos;d do it as a profession ?
well , if it makes you feel better ,
you were a great fake girlfriend .
oh , my god . you got ... it &apos;s like , all over your
no . it &apos;s , like , you got , no .
okay .
it &apos;s like ... just here . stop .
you &apos;re good .
thank you .
oh . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s tripp .
oh , you can &apos;t .
but what if it &apos;s important ?
serena , just give me the phone .
now you can &apos;t talk about him or think about him
or see him .
what ,
tie me to a chair until his plane leaves ?
i &apos;m gonna take you on a bar crawl ,
okay , like , really , really drunk .
deal ?
deal . you &apos;re the best .
oh , snow , have this apple martini
before your v.m.a. performance tonight .
i promise it &apos;s not poisoned .
okay , dwarves , that &apos;s your cue .
you know , i think the dwarves should be in the front .
okay . sorry . excuse me .
um , no one &apos;s gonna be able to see me .
yeah , this moment really is about the dwarves ,
right , dan ?
yeah , well , i mean ,
it &apos;s called &quot; snow white , &quot; so technically it &apos;s ...
of course you would take her side .
what ?
well , he &apos;s right . i &apos;m not standing in the back .
it was just a suggestion .
boxing me out is one of vanessa &apos;s favorite activities .
what did you say ?
okay . all right .
okay , girls , let &apos;s calm down , talk rationally .
you &apos;re the one who signned up for this cabaret
to box me out .
are you kidding me ?
you &apos;re the one who boxed me out today ,
with your morrissey plans . and that night .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
vanessa , you &apos;re in love with dan ,
and everybody here knows it .
it is true .
olivia , that &apos;s crazy .
come on .
okay , i don &apos;t need to put up with any of this .
i quit .
no , you don &apos;t . i quit .
what is going on ?
did you bozos have a threesome or something ?
oh , god . how stupid can you be ?
the third person is always supposed to be a stanger .
blair , this is my mess .
i can , i &apos;m gonna go talk to the girls .
in which order ?
exactly . you &apos;re gonna have to tech all by yourself .
i have an army to build , a school to take over
and girls to blackmail .
uh @-@ oh , playwright . better whip out your pen .
it looks like this cabaret just became a one @-@ man show .
olivia , i &apos;m not asking you to do cabaret for me .
i &apos;m asking you to do it for all the tweens of this world .
my fans don &apos;t care if i do cabaret .
but they &apos;ll care if they hear
their favorite queen of the dead had a ...
mirage with disgusting dan humphrey
and his celebutante girlfriend .
do you really want everyone here to know
that alterna chick abrams is literally a star ...
first i &apos;ll text t.m.z ...
then gossip girl ...
oh , and the town crier in nowheresville , vermont ,
so your parents find out .
so ...
what &apos;s it gonna be ?
do you realize we haven &apos;t been out drinking alone
since , uh ....
since the sheperd wedding .
yeah , the night that everything changed .
yeah .
maybe we should get some food and sober up
before something happens .
come on , nate . it &apos;s been three and a half years .
i can control myself if you can .
another round , please .
you got it .
saved by the bell .
hold on one second . i &apos;ll be , uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
hey .
nate .
i just found out ...
grandfather wasn &apos;t behind &quot; hudson hero . &quot;
it was maureen .
your mom just told me .
no . you &apos;re kidding me .
i &apos;m so sorry , nate .
i let you take the fall .
what are you ... don &apos;t worry about me , tripp .
it &apos;s you . what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can never trust her again .
i don &apos;t know if i even want to see her again .
of course you are angry
okay , tripp , but she &apos;s your wife . all right ?
any kind of separation this early in the term
could affect your reelection .
reelection is the last thing on my mind right now .
i just need to clear my head .
but you &apos;re out .
no , i &apos;m just at the brandy library with a friend .
listen , hang in there , and i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
was that dan again ?
yeah , the guy &apos;s got the most complicated love life .
how about that round ?

i understand if you want to leave
or , you know , go to a @-@ another table .

i &apos;m gonna go make sure the dwarves are ready .
and i have a little treat for paul i need to set up .
hey . i &apos;m i &apos;m glad you decided to come tonight .
well , blair didn &apos;t really give me much choice .
look , uh , vanessa and i are just friends .
yeah , she , she has no feelings for me . i &apos;m positive .
in fact , i made the same mistake when you went to japan .
so , you know , whatever you ... think you saw
during our , our thing ,
uh , it wasn &apos;t from her .
yeah , no . you &apos;re right .
right . see ?
i told you .
it wasn &apos;t from her .
it was from you .
i sat up to take my shirt off .
i look over ,
and ... you were looking at vanessa
like you &apos;ve never looked at me .
and then you kissed her , like ...
like you &apos;ve never kissed me .
no . that &apos;s , that &apos;s ...
that little thing ? that was hardly even a kiss .
that you even know what i &apos;m talking about
proves that it happened .
if you just let yourself ,
you &apos;ll see that your feelings for her are real ...
and you should stop kidding yourself .
hey , prince charming .
looks like it &apos;s time for you to look in enchanted mirror
platinum record on the wall ,
who &apos;s the most talented of us all ?
though your voice is as clear as day ,
your dance moves are quite passe .
and snow white &apos;s youth and sex appeal
means she &apos;ll get the record deal .
* i &apos;m screechy
my , what talent you small people have .
if only there were a vampy young vixen to front you ,
we &apos;d all be swimming in online sales .
luckily ... i happen to be dating one .
so you guys met at boarding school ? that &apos;s cool .
what ?
right .
yeah , eighth grade , le rosey .
good times .
yeah .
it was nice to meet you . i &apos;m gonna use the ladies room .
no , no , sit down . don &apos;t go empty @-@ handed .
here . just , uh , test the product , yeah ?
that won &apos;t be necessary .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
after i got your message , i had housekeeping
do an early turndown service on damien &apos;s room .
that &apos;s where they found his stash .
i &apos;ve had my own experience in the boat pond .
i &apos;m taking you home . you and your father have
until noon to collect your luggage .
after that , it &apos;s in the river .
chuck , you &apos;re totally overactive . i &apos;m really fine .
dude , the lady said she &apos;s fine .
dude ...
i &apos;m chuck bass .
even europeans must know what that means .
well , now that i &apos;ve added a disco @-@ electro pop beat
to snow white &apos;s love ballad
and put your voices through auto @-@ tune ,
it &apos;s time to take over the land .
let &apos;s have some fun .
this beat is sick .
that &apos;s her cue . where the hell is she ?
i have no idea .
well , you know what ? the disco stick tends to be
an unreliable form of transportation .
it , uh , it breaks down a lot .
what , what are you doing ? get in .
yes .
oh ... prince , here i am , snow white .
and i , and i got plastic surgery ,
and colored my hair , like you suggested .
oh , right . well , you look fantastic .
you know , it took me a long time
to get over what happened with us that night .
i actually , uh ...
two years ago at the masquerade ball ,
i tried to tell you i loved you .
it turns out i told jenny humphrey .
she was wearing your mask .
you , you loved me ?
of course i did .
serena , you &apos;re the most beautiful ,
amazing , alive person i &apos;ve ever known .
nate .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting something .
platinum record on the wall ,
it &apos;s me now who have it all .
just as long as true love &apos;s kiss
doesn &apos;t wake this coked @-@ up miss .
oh , if only the prince would kiss her ...
we could be international backup dancers
on her world tour .
there he is now !
yes .
you have to kiss her .
kiss her !
what are you doing ?
snow white is alive !
so snow white lives .
but are dan and olivia dead ?
blair , it was amazing .
you surprised us all .
speaking of which , i have a surprise for all of you .
and , uh , dan , if you ever think of applying
to the playwriting program , let me know if you want me
to read your sample , give some notes .
oh , thank you so much
yeah , i &apos;m gonna take you up on that offer .
everyone , follow me .
so maureen , uh ...
wow . i , um , i can &apos;t believe she did that .
i called her . she admitted it .
you okay ?
not really .
my wife isn &apos;t who i thought she was ,
and neither &apos;s my marriage .
nate , thanks for hearing me out earlier .
you &apos;re a great friend .
yeah , well ... any time .
wait . nate , you knew ?
why didn &apos;t you say anything to me ?
i ...
look , serena ,
i don &apos;t know anything anymore .
i just know i don &apos;t want to be alone .
could we take a walk ?
yeah .
hey , wait .
serena , i didn &apos;t tell you about maureen
because tripp &apos;s a married man .
if you go with him now , you &apos;re gonna cross the line .
thank you for everything , nate , really ,
but that line just got a little blurry .
i don &apos;t get it . what is all this ?
you may never have heard of cyrus rose
but lady gaga certainly has . back when she was
still at tisch , they used to play cards together .
who do you think &quot; poker face &quot; is about ?
that &apos;s why she &apos;s letting us see her dress rehearsal .
hey , olivia . where have you been ?
you kind of abandoned me out there .
i know . sorry .
i knew vanessa would step in ,
and i needed you to kiss her .
yeah , which i did , because i had to for the play .
i mean , you made me do it . you can &apos;t be mad .
you can &apos;t judge what happened
if you didn &apos;t see it .
i don &apos;t need to .
you were the one that needed to kiss her again ,
to realize for yourself that your feelings for her are real .
anyway , uh , i just got off the phone with k.c. ,
and she kinda convinced me to take that witch movie .
what ? olivia , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t leave like this .
i read the scripts .
it &apos;s actually pretty good .
i &apos;ll be back in the fall .
there you are . look ...
we &apos;re gonna have to talk about it .
we saw each other naked , and there &apos;s no going back .
but we &apos;re friends .
so , olivia , i apologize for how i acted during rehearsal .
but i don &apos;t like dan like that ,
and i haven &apos;t in years .
right ?
yeah . yeah , she &apos;s right .
and , you know ,
i think paul hoffma kinda of likes me .
look , i get the whole
&quot; sullen teenager pushing an envelope &quot; thing .
i &apos;ve pushed a pack .
but you &apos;re better than that damien guy .
look , i may be queen ,
but i &apos;m more lonely and bored
than i was when i lived in brooklyn .
and being with him is exciting .
and dangerous .
please . it takes one to know one .
i saw that look in your eye the very first day
you came on my radar .
and what so @-@ called look would that be ?
be very careful , jennifer humphrey .
if you go down the rabbit hole , it &apos;s going to take more
than blair waldorf and your army of minions
to drag you back out .
so what , you &apos;re gonna walk me to my room
and make sure i don &apos;t get into any trouble ?
just try not to run into any euro dealers in the kitchen .
you okay ?
sometimes it &apos;s after the curtains close
that the real reckonings come .
whether it &apos;s about who we wish we were ...
or who we wish we could be
