&quot; you got to hide your love away &quot;
cancer is a biological bully ,
always picking a fight ,
and it &apos;ll sneak up on you .
can we just stay in bed all day ?
i could be into that .
you are not making this any easier .
okay , okay , 15 minutes .
i have 15 minutes
until i absolutely have to get up and get going .
all right , well , then let &apos;s make
the most of the next 15 minutes !
it &apos;ll wait until the body feels safe ,
until it feels healthy and strong ...
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m dating a man who lives in a tin can .
a tin can on wheels .
you ever think of moving to a place that can &apos;t roll away ?
i ... haven &apos;t given it much thought .
not that i don &apos;t love the trailer
and the roughing it in nature .
it &apos;s like camping .
mmm . wait . wait . you hate camping .
i hate camping . i do .
well , maybe we should look at getting
a bigger place ... together .
i thought you hadn &apos;t given it much thought .
i just did . i &apos;m a fast thinker .
what do you think ?
i think that &apos;s a good idea .
i &apos;m a fast thinker , too .
that &apos;s when cancer will move on in
and get bigger and bigger .
what do you think -- the blue or the , uh , burgundy ?
the blue makes you look too handsome .
you don &apos;t want the president to be distracted
by those piercing blue eyes .
oh , you want me to get the job .
i want neurosurgeon dr. shepherd to get the job .
i don &apos;t want my husband dr. shepherd to get the job .
that &apos;s complicated .
yes , well , i &apos;m complicated .
i &apos;m gonna take a shower now .
so am i.
no .
it &apos;s been three weeks .
you went back on your promise .
i can &apos;t sleep with a man who &apos;s a lying liar .
what if i put on the blue tie ?
nope .
you &apos;re having fun . you delight in my pain .
i just took off my robe .
now i &apos;m soaping myself up .
oh , my goodness .
the body never even sees it coming ...
callie , come on . we got to go .
well , we said we &apos;d each do a box a day .
i &apos;m doing mine , so come do yours .
no , no , no . sophia &apos;s ready to go .
come on -- it &apos;ll just take a minute .
callie -- - unpack this box !
you know , the whole world is not going to end
if i don &apos;t open this box --
open it .
... because cancer is the master of surprises .
i inscribed the band
with the date we moved into this house .
our new start .
calliope iphegenia torres --
put it on !
take it off !
take it off ! your ring .
take off your ring .
thank you , dr. avery .
i am , um -- i &apos;m glad you agree
that a microvascular free flap is called for in this ...
... particular sc-- scenario .
yeah .
well , you are not getting your security deposit back .
glad i never gave you one .
you guys are really serious .
yes , we are .
what did i miss ?
owen and emma are moving in together .
he holds a meeting for that ?
thank you all for coming .
i know you &apos;re all busy , so this won &apos;t take long .
the board has just approved a new non @-@ fraternization policy .
this hospital has to be a safe work environment
where our focus remains clearly on providing
the best patient care possible .
moving forward ,
all relationships with co @-@ workers
will be discouraged .
and all relationships between superiors and subordinates
is strictly prohibited .
you will all receive a copy of the new rules .
your supervisors will arrange meetings to go over the details .
and that &apos;s it . let &apos;s get back to work .
so , um , you &apos;re the panty police now ?
i know there will be some feelings ,
and i know you &apos;ve established
good relationships with the residents ,
so i &apos;d like you to take them today
and make sure that they understand the policy .
so you want me to be the panty police .
all due respect , nuts to that .
dr. hunt , we have some questions about the policy .
dr. webber can answer all of your questions .
hey , rory . how you doing ?
besides the fact that i have bone cancer , i &apos;m great .
seriously . look at this polish .
it &apos;s called &quot; bad to the bone . &quot;
we saw it at the drugstore ,
and it was like god ordered us to buy it .
hey , i don &apos;t take any orders from any god
who gives me cancer twice .
dude , your stupid brain cancer got us a puppy ,
and your stupid bone cancer
is getting us both out of finals .
you &apos;re right .
yay , god .
take a deep breath .
all right , so , today &apos;s gonna be a piece of cake .
we &apos;re gonna stage the tumor , do a biopsy ,
and then we &apos;ll come up with a treatment plan .
this isn &apos;t a brain tumor coming back ?
i mean , it was six years ago , but --
no , i looked at dr. shepherd &apos;s notes
and his follow @-@ up scans ,
and i really think that you beat that .
i think this is a totally separate cancer .
are you having any trouble breathing ?
no .
she has decreased breath sounds .
let &apos;s add a contrast study to that staging c.t.
why ? what do you think it is ?
uh , the contrast just gives us more of a detailed look .
um , yeah , you know , and it &apos;ll give your toes
a chance to dry before the biopsy .
perfect . yeah .
coming through .
what do we got ?
lisa campbell , 32,
found in apartment trash chute .
compactor tore her leg up pretty good before it jammed .
lost a lot of blood in the field ,
but vitals are stable .
why was she in a trash --
foraging for food , probably .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i &apos;m not homeless . i don &apos;t forage .
i have a phd .
on my count . one , two , three .
okay , start her on one gram of cefazolin .
we need to clean this out . page plastics .
i &apos;ll do it .
all right , lisa , is there anyone you &apos;d like for us to call ?
my boyfriend .
i was in that trash chute for two days .
he &apos;s probably worried sick .
his name is ted .
if his wife answers ,
hang up and try again in an hour .
this can &apos;t be legal .
it is .
the hospital is allowed to create any policy
regarding co @-@ workers dating that they see fit .
shepherd met grey while she was an intern .
and what about warren and bailey ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . we &apos;re married , so just ...
if dating co @-@ workers is frowned upon ,
how are they supposed to meet anyone ?
i &apos;m good . you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
you spend half your life here , shane .
this is your dating pool .
why am i the only one who thinks this is ridiculous ?
they shouldn &apos;t be able to do this to us .
nobody &apos;s doing anything to you .
this is being done for you .
one of your own didn &apos;t feel safe at work
and lodged an anonymous complaint .
one of our own ?
you realize you just made my relationship illegal .
pretty sure he just said it was anonymous .
yeah , right .
that &apos;s a giant mass .
could be a met .
she had brain cancer six years ago ,
and torres is doing a biopsy on a possible osteosarcoma .
three cancers by the ripe , all at age of 16 .
that &apos;s bad luck or something genetic .
bailey &apos;s gonna test for a link .
what do you think ?
highly invasive .
i don &apos;t think you can remove it
without shrinking it first .
what if she doesn &apos;t respond to chemo ?
then we still need to figure out
a surgical approach that won &apos;t just kill her .
we need to be as aggressive as this cancer .
okay .
all right , folks .
you &apos;re gonna study her case files , look at the scans .
i want you to come up with a surgical treatment plan .
the board did you a favor with this new rule .
you &apos;re gonna take all that brain power you use
to devote to penises and vaginas and put it to some good use .
um , can we , uh , use other doctors as resources ?
what , like your wife ?
yes , you should , and you can .
work as a team .
bounce ideas off of one another .
you come up with something , i &apos;m all ears .
so , uh , you guys want to start
throwing some ideas around or ... ?
i &apos;m good on my own .
my flight leaves at 9 : 00 tonight .
the cab &apos;s gonna pick me up here .
the kids are in daycare .
the laundry is clean and folded ,
and the kitchen is fully stocked .
it &apos;s one last interview .
you &apos;ve said that before the last two interviews .
i know . i will see you before i leave .
where you going ?
uh , actually , i have another interview with the white house .
oh , show @-@ off .
hey , do you want to sleep over ?
you can help me try and figure out
why my research isn &apos;t working .
and you can help me with the kids .
mnh @-@ mnh . sounds like fraternization .
we could talk about owen and emma .
oh , what &apos;s there to talk about ?
they &apos;re moving in . whatever .
i have wine .
i &apos;ll be there .
yeah . figured .
for you .
so , we &apos;re supposed to fill this whole thing up with spit ?
no . to the line .
how ?
think about dill pickles .
oh , my god . it works .
every time .
and this is going to tell you ... ?
if there &apos;s a genetic reason
why you all keep getting cancer .
well , it &apos;s got to be in my wife &apos;s side .
there &apos;s been a couple of breast ,
a pancreas , a lung , and a butt .
oh , and billy &apos;s balls .
but we keep surviving .
we beat cancer .
yep .
that &apos;s what we do .
go ahead and alert the o.r. i have a debride leg repair .
right away , doctor .
god , lisa .
i told you not to come to the party .
i also told you not to have a secret affair
with the head of the sociology department , by the way .
i know . i know . you &apos;re right .
but , you know , i wasn &apos;t going to go ,
but then everyone from the department was going .
it would have looked strange if i wasn &apos;t there .
really ?
you don &apos;t think getting stuck in his trash chute
with a piece of fish in your hair
looks more strange than not going to a party ?
how did this happen ?
well , you know , he ignored me all night ,
which maybe i &apos;m -- i &apos;m used to
because that &apos;s how we are in public .
but after a while , i just --
i couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
so , i grabbed my coat and made a break for the door ,
but just as i was about to leave ,
he called my name , and i stopped because --
finally .
but all he did was ask if i &apos;d mind
throwing out the trash on my way out .
and i didn &apos;t know what to say ,
so i @-@ i @-@ i took the bag , the big , smelly trash bag ,
and i tossed it in the chute .
but i was so mortified because i didn &apos;t realize
i had thrown my purse along with it .
so , you jumped in after it ?
oh , i clearly make excellent choices .
does ted know what happened ?
no . i didn &apos;t tell him .
i was trying to preserve your dignity .
thank you .
i didn &apos;t realize there was nothing left to preserve .
um , well , i certainly can &apos;t do anything about your dignity ,
but if we &apos;re gonna preserve this leg ,
we need to get you right up to the o.r.
is that a shrimp tail ?
oh , no , that &apos;s a prawn .
ted &apos;s wife prepared them .
they were actually really good .
oh , my god .
well , the prelim path report
looks like high @-@ grade osteosarcoma .
but we &apos;ll need another day to get the final report .
we still need to figure out
what &apos;s going on in her chest .
yeah .
hey ! did you show kepner ?
no , no , no , she &apos;s working with avery all day ,
so i didn &apos;t want to brag .
ah , good call .
but then we had coffee , and it sparkled ,
so i ended up , you know , showing it off , anyway .
there were -- there were squeals .
hey , karev , do you notice anything different about me ?
no .
callie gave it to me .
we &apos;re trying to unpack a box a day .
so , this morning , callie was --
hey , you know , most people at least pretend
to like this story , so --
alex , you can &apos;t keep ignoring my pages .
we really need to talk .
not now .
if not now , when ?
we can &apos;t sneak off to have a private conversation .
it &apos;s forbidden !
oh , will you stop ? it &apos;s just a stupid rule .
nobody &apos;s taking it seriously .
i &apos;m taking it seriously .
you don &apos;t have to worry about it because you have seniority ,
but i &apos;m a resident .
this is my reputation we &apos;re talking about , my career .
i know that you think the rule is crap ,
but we can &apos;t just ignore it at my expense .
you &apos;re overreacting !
no , i &apos;m not !
oh , so , what , you &apos;re just gonna roll over
and let the hospital tell you who you can be with ?
there isn &apos;t a choice .
there &apos;s always a choice !
you can choose to make the best out of a bad situation .
you can choose to act like an adult .
you can choose not to pick a fight
in front of the entire hospital .
you want to walk around here
and pretend like we don &apos;t mean anything to each other ?
fine . i &apos;ll make it easy for you .
we don &apos;t mean anything to each other ,
not anymore , &apos; cause we &apos;re done !
that is not what i want .
oh , screw it !
alex !
are you okay ?
how was that ?
alarmingly convincing .
just stop freaking out , okay ?
now i will .
thanks for doing that for me .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
you know , i appreciate the dinner date ,
but i thought webber told you people to work together .
we &apos;re not gonna get anywhere that way .
i @-@ i know this non @-@ fraternization policy
is gonna be beneficial in the long run ,
but for now , it just gives those kids
one more reason to shut me out .
um , just who are you trying to fraternize with ?
um , my wife .
they &apos;re mad at me because i get to be happy .
seems hardly fair .
i agree .
but , uh , you know , they &apos;re gonna hate me anyway .
so , uh , might as well get something out of it , right ?
ben warren , we are at work .
but you can lock that door .
oh , my god .
already ?
i haven &apos;t even gotten started yet .
no , um , there &apos;s a mutation in the p53 gene .
what does that mean ?
emma probably keeps a nice home ,
has window treatments , uses place mats .
oh , place mats are overrated .
i want him to be happy .
i &apos;m enjoying torturing derek .
does that make me a terrible person ?
it &apos;s weird , though .
it &apos;s really over .
i &apos;m empty .
that window is closing .
she is gonna give him babies .
and then he &apos;s gonna be somebody &apos;s daddy .
and then it &apos;s really over .
but you guys are divorced and seeing other people .
doesn &apos;t that mean it &apos;s really over , anyway ?
oh , come on .
you should know better than anyone
that that is not true .
but somebody &apos;s daddy ?
you kind of can &apos;t get between that .
you &apos;re supposed to be on a plane .
they called me before i even left to go to the airport
and cancelled the interview .
well , what does that mean ?
the president dumped him .
you know , i &apos;m out . i &apos;m out .
you guys , uh , have , uh , a good night .
i &apos;m catching a cab .
bye , bye , bye .
kiss to the girls .
i think i &apos;m gonna turn in .
you don &apos;t know that it &apos;s over .
what did they say ?
i better turn in .
congratulations !
i heard you &apos;re moving ...
in with emma !
um , yeah .
we might , yeah .
yeah , so i brought you some wine !
wait . this is a very nice bottle of wine .
yeah , i know .
uh , uh , i swiped it from derek &apos;s collection .
it looked really expensive .
so , enjoy !
the both of you .
oh , no , emma &apos;s -- she &apos;s not here .
so , what &apos;s the plan now ?
should i start sneaking in your bedroom window ?
you -- you do live with one of the board members .
i told you -- she &apos;s at mer &apos;s .
yeah , i &apos;m not just talking about tonight .
look . things will blow over .
i &apos;ll work on mer and cristina .
this will all go away .
until then , yeah ,
maybe you sneak in my bedroom window .
but yang &apos;s supposed to be out all night tonight .
yeah . you want to go upstairs ?
i would , but upstairs is just so far away .
i got so many compliments on my ring today .
it &apos;s so sad , though , about alex and wilson .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s not fair , right , that we get to be so happy
and other people have to be so miserable ?
yeah , like april -- just out in the cold .
i feel terrible .
awful .
who am i gonna sleep with ?
the -- the hospital is my dating pool .
you -- you are making it impossible
for me to get laid .
well , i don &apos;t think that has ever been a problem .
yeah , well ...
are you sad
there weren &apos;t any window treatments at the firehouse ?
what ?
you know , drapes and , uh ,
the thing that goes on top of it .
uh ... what are they called ?
it &apos;s a -- curtain rod ?
mnh @-@ mnh . no .
i mean , yes , obviously you need that ,
but there &apos;s that other thing .
i should know this .
my mother is an interior decorator .
i spent my childhood
listening to her talk about these things .
who are you -- are you --
mom ? hey , it &apos;s me .
yes . yeah , i know it &apos;s late .
no , i &apos;m fine .
listen , uh , what do you call ,
uh , those things that are on top of your windows ?
no , the other thing .
valance ! yes !
thank you . okay , good night .
valance .
were you -- were you sad
we -- we -- we never had valances ?
no .
no .
a little bit ?
no . no .
i &apos;m not sad ...
that we didn &apos;t have valances .
it never occurred to me , you know ,
to get window treatments .
i &apos;ll put them in for you .
great . thank you .
hey , sorry i couldn &apos;t come by last night .
oh , no , no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s fine .
i had three surgeries ,
including an emergency &quot; c &quot; at 28 weeks .
baby &apos;s fine .
oh , that &apos;s great .
yeah , it is . it was .
and so are you .
and i wanted to say something in person ,
but i &apos;m ...
okay , i &apos;m just nervous , so i &apos;m just gonna say it .
so , we &apos;re gonna look at houses ,
and there &apos;s gonna be that awkward conversation
about how many bedrooms we need ,
awkward because this is kind of new
and we haven &apos;t really talked about kids ,
and houses have bedrooms , and kids go in bedrooms .
so , um , okay , i &apos;m just gonna--
i would like two kids , maybe three ,
and i plan on not working until they &apos;re in school
and being the kind of mom that walks them to school ,
so i need a good school district .
i &apos;m freaking you out .
um-- crap .
when i went over this in the car ,
uh , it didn &apos;t sound so
&quot; marry me and sire my children . &quot;
it was reasonable .
no , it--
it is .
you should be talking about this stuff .
good .
i &apos;m not crazy .
mnh @-@ mnh , no , you &apos;re not crazy .
okay , then .
so , i &apos;ll meet you back here tonight ,
and we &apos;ll go to the real @-@ estate agent .
yeah . okay .
bye .
it &apos;s time to rethink the plan .
hey . what did you find ?
oh , rory has li @-@ fraumeni syndrome .
li for what ?
never even heard of it .
neither had i.
it &apos;s an extremely rare genetic condition
due to a mutation in the p53 gene
that suppresses the ability to regulate cell growth .
the poor kid can &apos;t fight off tumors .
so , as soon as you cure one cancer , another one pops up .
yeah . that &apos;s awesome .
now , i &apos;m meeting with the family today .
i &apos;d like to be able to tell them
we have some sort of plan in place for rory .
okay , so , that chest tumor might not even be a met
from the osteosarcoma .
that makes chemo that much more complicated .
okay , the tumor in her leg should respond
to doxorubicin , plus cisplatin .
radiation &apos;s out .
it would make her too susceptible to new tumors .
the chest tumor &apos;s so vascular ,
even a biopsy would be pushing our luck .
how rare is this ?
only a few hundred families are reported in the literature .
we need those case studies ,
but , i mean , that could take awhile .
not if i get those residents on it .
sorry i &apos;m late . i &apos;m doing scut for hunt .
well , it &apos;ll get handled . this is more important .
all right , listen up .
your assignment &apos;s changed .
rory has li @-@ fraumeni syndrome .
it &apos;s rare .
dig up every case of it you can find .
find out what worked , what didn &apos;t .
i want one of you to look for dr. karev .
he &apos;s with the oncologist .
i will .
are you sure ?
yeah . got to face him sometime .
now , you can &apos;t rely solely on the internet .
hit the library .
now .
uh , ross , a word ?
you &apos;ve been quiet .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in your head ,
but if it &apos;s too soon to come back full time ,
we can talk .
no .
just trying to keep my head down and work , sir .
well , if you feel like you have something to say ,
speak up , son .
keeping it inside won &apos;t help you or anyone else .
the last time i spoke up , a patient nearly died .
that was grief and exhaustion talking .
i &apos;d like to hear you talk .
thank you .
of course .
you shoud put me back in o.r. rotation .
start clipping aneurysms again .
derek .
hey .
dr. hunt .
well , it would be good to have you back .
it used to be all i wanted to do .
i &apos;m grateful that they approached me for the project
and that you pushed me towards it .
it wasn &apos;t about washington or the accolades .
they &apos;re looking for answers
to questions i &apos;ve been asking my whole career .
and to know that that project is out there --
i mean , how do i go back to being satisfied
doing neurosurgery again ?
yeah .
your standards have changed .
yeah .
my standards have changed .
we were able to clean it out in surgery .
and now we &apos;re gonna let this vacuum dressing work its magic
and start the healing process .
oh , my god , those are beautiful .
did ted send them ?
no .
they &apos;re from your mom .
oh , damn it , lisa . really ?
no , it &apos;s not ted .
i mean , it is ted .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m insane .
this whole thing has made me certifiably crazy .
i am a college prefessor .
i &apos;m supposed to be , you know , smart .
but instead i &apos;m jumping into trash chutes
and bursting into tears because i &apos;m heartbroken
that my mom cares about me more than some jerk
who won &apos;t even talk to me in public !
what is that ?
can you hand me my phone ?
i just want to call my mom and thank her for the flowers .
sure .
you &apos;re gonna call ted , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m a monster .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , we need to go public with this thing , okay ?
i can &apos;t keep track of when and where
i can put my arms on my own wife .
look . i know it &apos;s hard .
but the whispers and the stares after the wedding
have just started to die down .
as soon as we tell people ,
they &apos;re just gonna start up again .
yeah .
plus , i like our secret , little marriage bubble .
sneaking around is kind of sexy .
i am so proud that you &apos;re my wife .
i am married to a brilliant , gorgeous trauma surgeon ,
and i just don &apos;t want to hide it anymore , you know ?
okay , that &apos;s even sexier .
so what do we do ?
i think we should start telling people .
in a more , uh , controlled setting .
just -- doctor .
well , it looks like we &apos;re gonna get you started on chemo soon .
i saw mom talking to dr. bailey .
there were tears .
oh , wow . thanks for the cancer genes , mom .
if you have it , i have it .
oh , you haven &apos;t been sick a day in your life .
you have dad &apos;s nice , safe genes .
maybe not .
we &apos;ll find out after the test .
you know , you don &apos;t have to find out if you don &apos;t want to .
knowledge sucks .
your face sucks .
oh , come on . i &apos;m not kidding .
i know we like to act like this isn &apos;t a big deal
and we &apos;re the family that beats cancer ,
but we &apos;re not actually beating anything .
i mean , like , i can handle one cancer at a time ,
but it &apos;s all i see now --
just cancer after cancer until i &apos;m dead .
and i wish i could go back and un @-@ know that .
she can say no , right ?
it &apos;s her decision .
not according to mom and dad .
they say i need to know because it &apos;ll determine whether i take an aspirin
or get a brain scan for a headache .
and if i &apos;m gonna have kids , i need to know --
kids ? you &apos;re a kid .
i &apos;m just saying , all right ?
mom and dad are freaking out ,
and they &apos;re calling the whole damn family
and wanting everyone to get a test
and wanting to start a foundation
and change the world
and be like the family that fights li @-@ fraumeni .
who cares what they want ? what do you want ?
i can really decide for myself ?
even though i &apos;m only 16
and my parents say that i have to ?
i can say no ? i can make the decision ?
it &apos;s your life .
nobody can make you do anything you don &apos;t want to do .
hey . i need the oncology report on rory .
they said we should add methotrexate
for the osteosarcoma .
okay , thanks .
hey , what -- what are you doing ?
i &apos;m done sneaking around .
they can &apos;t tell us what to do or what to feel .
if they want to fire me , fine .
we had a plan . what happened ?
look . it &apos;s a stupid plan .
we &apos;re adults . we love each other .
they can go screw themselves .
what was that ?
is somebody in there ?
hey , guys .
you want to just hand me my shirt ?
mine , too .
hi .
appreciate it .
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
no !
dr. webber . this isn &apos;t what it looks like .
well , i &apos;m fired .
we &apos;re not fired .
you &apos;re not . you &apos;re an attending .
i &apos;m an expendable resident .
the rules are just a dumb thing on paper
to cover the board &apos;s ass .
no one actually cares .
well , speaking
as the hypocritical board member in the room ,
the board cares .
since when are you two still doing it ?
since the wedding .
nice .
what ?
i &apos;m deciding whether this makes me
hate you more or less .
more .
hey , well , um , since we have you guys here ,
there &apos;s something that we wanted to share ...
oh , no .
think he &apos;s still out there ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
you guys want to close the --
no ?
hey .
hey . i need a consult .
okay .
so , my project is at a standstill
unless i hand it over to a bioengineer .
okay .
what &apos;s your pitch ?
become a bioengineer .
i can &apos;t give derek the satisfaction
of lightening my workload
because his guilt is my only ray of sunshine .
well , he doesn &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna get the job ,
if that makes you feel any better .
i know .
i actually feel kind of bad for him .
but i feel worse for me . i hate quitting .
don &apos;t think of it as quitting .
you &apos;re waiting for science to catch up to your brilliance .
think of it as --
as letting someone else take your project out for a spin .
you just step back , see what else is out there ,
so when you come back to your project , you &apos;ll have fresh eyes .
it &apos;ll be better than ever , just like coming home .
you slept with owen .
yes , i did .
don &apos;t .
karev , talk to me .
she was hypertensive and unresponsive ,
with absent breath sounds
over her left chest when i got here .
a needle for a tension pneumo .
okay , we &apos;ll have to get her intubated .
okay .
ariel , i need you to go find your parents .
i couldn &apos;t wake her up
when the machine started beeping .
i tried , but -- - look , this is not your fault .
we &apos;re gonna help your sister , okay ?
go find your parents . go ! now !
where the hell did all this blood come from ?
her tumor could have ruptured . we &apos;ve got to get her to an o.r.
guys , i just found a case of li @-@ fraumeni in chicago .
the guy has almost the exact same types of cancers as rory .
uh , they tried neoadjuvant chemo to shrink it ,
then surgery , and then , uh ...
and ?
and then he died .
i &apos;m really sorry for what i &apos;m about to say ,
and i want you to know that i &apos;m not trying to be mean ,
but i think that you should hear it from me .
jackson and april are still together .
what ?
webber just walked in on alex , me , and them in a closet .
i @-@ i &apos;m confused .
you know , i @-@ i know that you were trying to punish them
when you made your complaint , but they &apos;re fine , steph .
they &apos;re great .
the only one who &apos;s being punished is me !
this is gonna force alex and me apart !
didn &apos;t you guys just break up ?
no , we faked it .
i &apos;m so confused .
you know what you do
when your little heart gets broken , steph ?
you talk about it with your friends .
you don &apos;t file a complaint !
i don &apos;t know how many times i have to tell you this .
it was an anon--
an anonymous complaint , which you file ,
because you &apos;re afraid if people find out it was you ,
they &apos;d treat you like crap .
instead of understanding or even trying to understand
that it wasn &apos;t some frivolous thing you did
because your little heart got broken ,
but a decision you made because you felt like
your medical education had been compromised .
god , i don &apos;t even know why i bothered .
i should have just signed my name .
this job is a privilege and a gift ,
and we are squandering it .
i almost lost my place in this program
because i got distracted ... with dr. yang .
and you are all letting distractions
get in the way of our work .
we have a chance here to actually save this girl .
and i have an idea .
look .
you slept with yang ?
the anatomy &apos;s all messed up .
the tumor &apos;s stuck to everything in here .
let &apos;s try clamping the aorta ,
that may temporarily help curb the bleeding .
now i just have to find it .
this patient survived six types of cancers ,
they were onto something .
yeah , but then he died from a surgical complication .
so , if we combined radiofrequency ablation
with an anterior @-@ approach en bloc resection ...
yes .
v @-@ fib . starting cardiac massage .
charge the paddles to 10 .
no , no , no , no .
look . look . look .
this gives us good local control .
so we can treat the tumor
without compromising the healthy lung tissue .
exactly .
okay , charge to 20 .
clear .
all right . we got a rhythm .
it &apos;s weak , but it &apos;ll do .
okay , let &apos;s get in there and find the source .
and we can get a biopsy while we &apos;re in there
to customize the chemo to her specific tumor .
this will work , guys .
let &apos;s go tell webber .
we got it ! we figured it out !
you start with radiofrequency ablation .
then you take the remainder out en bloc .
and the healthy tissue remains healthy .
guys . - but here &apos;s a twist --
you can do a biopsy .
which will customize her chemo .
that &apos;s not gonna work .
it might have .
it &apos;s a worthy pitch ,
but rory bled out into her chest tonight .
it looks like it tore into her aorta .
we did everything we could .
she died ?
she died .
we tried everything .
no .
oh , my god .
we &apos;re so sorry .
do i have it ?
the gene -- i want to know if i have it .
no , honey . now is not the time .
no , now is the time , mom .
i want to know .
you know .
dr. bailey told you .
ariel .
do i have it ?
yeah .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay , mom .
i always wanted to be like her , and now i am .
i &apos;m just like rory .
really ? webber told on us ?
none of us want to be here , karev .
then why are we ?
you &apos;re having a relationship with a subordinate ,
and that is against policy .
can we not talk about my pernal life ?
i &apos;d love to not talk about it , alex ,
but you are making me .
now , i realize that we cannot legislate for romantic feelings .
okay , obviously , what you do at home is your own business .
look , we &apos;re just asking that , at work ,
things remain strictly professional .
that &apos;s crap !
alex .
it &apos;s okay for you all to flaunt
your relationships and your rings
and your -- your -- your happy , little lives
just because you &apos;re married ?
karev , just sit down .
no !
i &apos;m not gonna let a bunch of hypocrites
tell me to keep my pants on at work
when this place was built on all of you
feeling each other up in our on @-@ call room !
i &apos;m done ! punish me ! whatever !
okay , so , this is not how we wanted to tell you guys this ,
because it could look like
we &apos;re trying to get off the hook ,
which we are not .
but we -- we are married .
what ?
yes , april is my wife .
so , our supply @-@ closet activity breaks no rules .
since when ?
since the wedding .
my other wedding .
kepner , you continue to surprise me .
con-- congratulations .
thank you .
okay . so , i sh-- i should probably go .
i &apos;m so sorry . good luck .
filing that complaint really took balls ,
balls i didn &apos;t have .
jo &apos;s gonna be so pissed at me , isn &apos;t she ?
oh , yeah , she is .
hide at the bar ?
yes , please .
all right .
shane , we &apos;re drinking . you &apos;re coming .
you can try to hide from a bully .
but hiding won &apos;t work for long .
you &apos;re gonna send her flowers , you &apos;re gonna apologize ,
and then you are never going to see her again .
i &apos;ll take this outside .
okay .
tell him he kisses like a turtle &apos;s butt .
is she breaking up with him for you ?
i can &apos;t be trusted to do it . i &apos;m crazy .
but the first step is admitting you have a problem , right ?
no more secret romances , no more married men .
what are you doing this weekend ?
you &apos;re beautiful .
and you &apos;ve already seen me naked .
so , you might as well buy me dinner .
i actually already have plans with my wife , so ...
stuck in a trash chute -- check .
prawn stuck in my leg -- check .
embarrass myself in front of my surgeons -- double check .
yeah . that about sounds right . i can die now .
you know , he really should wear a ring .
it &apos;s not fair ,
going around looking like that without one .
totally agree .
there &apos;s really only one way to win .
it &apos;s an interesting idea .
i wish we &apos;d had a chance to give it a try .
you know , but maybe we &apos;ll be ahead of the game
for her sister .
it was -- it was a team effort .
i don &apos;t want to get ahead of myself ,
but i think i &apos;m starting
to make some headway with those kids .
warren !
dr. bailey , we &apos;re gonna go to joe &apos;s .
you mind ? can ben come ?
go on .
go play with your friends .
but don &apos;t stay out too late .
sure you want to come ?
just rub that in our faces .
i &apos;m gonna come out .
believe me -- i &apos;m gonna get home tonight .
you have to fight back .
i don &apos;t understand .
this morning , we were making plans to see houses together ,
and now you want to break up .
i thought i knew what i wanted .
what , the house , the kids , or me ?
emma , i am so sorry .
don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t need an apology .
i want an explanation .
because the last time i checked , which was this morning ,
we were on the exact same page , and now we &apos;re not .
what changed ?
i want to come home to someone at night
who is equally as passionate about their work --
i am .
emma , you --
you would give up surgery
in exchange for family .
that &apos;s a problem ?
no . no , it &apos;s amazing -- for you .
i want you to have that --
house with the bedrooms and the kids .
it is a beautiful future .
but i want to come home at night
and exchange o.r. stories .
we want different things .
so it &apos;s me .
emma , come on .
please . just please let me go .
emma , emma --
i &apos;m gonna call a cab .
will you wait a few minutes
so that i &apos;m gone before you leave ?
and if you &apos;re lucky enough to get out alive ...
... take just a moment to celebrate ...
the white house called .
you got it ?
no , it &apos;s much bigger than that .
that &apos;s why the interview process was so exhaustive .
they want me on the advisory board .
they want me to run the thing .
you &apos;re mad .
no .
i &apos;m not mad .
i @-@ i just -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m happy for you .
but there isn &apos;t room
for me to take my career to the next level
and for you to run the thing .
derek , that &apos;s frustrating .
come here .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna have sex with my husband ...
... because three weeks is too long .
and i guess i do find
presidential appointments very sexy .
and then we can fight more later .
... before you put your guard back up ,
ready to fight the next one .
