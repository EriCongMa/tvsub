Oh! Finally!
You're still down by 10.
I'll beat you someday.
Check.
You beat me at everything.
Let me be better at something. Okay?
Come on.
You ready?
Come on, come on. Ah!
All right, all right, all right. Here it is.
Game point.
Rizzoli-Rizzoli.
Take the shot!
Yeah. Oh!
Hey, hey, you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
No, no. Come on, let me see it.
No, I'm good.
Aw!
What?
No, no, no, no. That's bad. Come on.
It's bad?
Yeah, let's get you some ice.
Hold your head up, hold your head up.
Come on. Come on, come on.
All right, all right.
All right, just don't touch.
Oh, yeah, that's broken. Oh, yeah.
It's broken?
Let me see.
Ow! God! Hey!
Okay, okay.
Why you got to do that?
Well, let's get some ice on it! Come on!
Hurry up.
Come on. Come on, come on.
Keep it up, keep it up.
It's up.
Get something before mom comes home.
All right, all right, all right. Here.
Thank you very much.
There you go.
Thank you.
On the good towel!
What?
Excuse me. Aah!
What happened?! God!
How do you always manage to turn Sunday dinner
into a circus every week?
Me?
Yeah, you.
It was my fault. I did it.
It's his fault!
No, I know you didn't mean to do it.
So this is my fault?
Look, I tell you all the time,
don't roughhouse with him!
Oh, someone, uh...bird! Bird keeps calling you.
Detective Crowe?
You answered my phone?
Ma, why didn't you just tell me?!
Because you were having so much fun having your...
Rizzoli.
It's Frost. Bad things in West Roxbury.
All right, I'll be right there.
Dad and Tommy are gonna be here any minute for dinner.
I told you I was on call.
Here. It won't be attractive if your nose swells up.
You never know who you might run into.
Ma.
What?
Because I meet so many great guys at work.
Too bad they're all dead. Huh?
Ow. Later, jerk.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
Okay. Have fun!
Yeah, thanks.
News of a brutal murder
of a doctor in an upscale Bellev Hill neighborhood
in West Roxbury shocked and terrified
this tight-knit community...
It's the coroner. Go, go.
Dr. Isles, what can you tell us
about the murder?
I'll have a statement for you later tonight, Kitty.
Detective.
What's up, doc?
Evening, Dr. Isles.
Hello, Casey.
Dr. Maura Isles, Chief Medical Examiner.
Come on, it's your lucky day.
Can't say this on camera,
but we call Dr. Isles "Queen of the dead."
What's that, Crowe?
Oh, Jeez, take a mind off.
Commander cleared you?
What's it to you?
It's my case.
Since when? I'm up.
I got clearance. Move.
I just spoke to the commander.
It's my case. Where's Frost?
Losing his lunch...where else?
God.
He should've stayed in robbery.
Hangnails make him gag.
That guy gives us a bad name.
Hey, come on. Leave him alone.
You okay, buddy?
Something I ate.
Where's the crime scene?
Follow your nose. Might bring back some memories.
What's that supposed to mean?
You'll see.
Have fun, Rizzoli.
Hands hurt?
It's gonna rain.
Rizzoli, homicide victor 825.
Going back for more, Frost?
Wow. Not in south Boston anymore, Dorothy.
Korsak, I thought you were on vacation.
Cut it short.
That bad?
Worse.
Oh, man.
10 centimeters.
Jane, if you got this,
I can start processing the rest of the house.
Yeah, go ahead.
Carotid artery and jugular have been transected.
What's odd is how precise it is.
Hairline fracture of the nasal bone
above the lateral nasal cartilage.
It's not disfiguring.
Looks pretty disfiguring to me.
Can you pop this out for me?
Can't you do something safe,
like yoga?
Might hurt a little.
Okay.
Okay.
Ow! "A little"?
Put some ice on it for the next 24 hours
so you don't look like Mike Tyson.
Victim is Dr. Martin Yeager, 34.
Wife, Gail, is missing.
Diamond was too small so she whacked him and walked out?
No. We found signs of forced entry.
Well-to-do couple.
Man is bound and posed. Woman is missing.
And a teacup.
Is he out? Is the surgeon out?
Oh, my god. Korsak?
He's not out. It's his M.O.,that's all.
Why didn't you warn us, warn Jane, at least?
I wanted your unbiased assessment.
Looks like Hoyt, right?
Korsak, we put that son of a bitch behind bars.
You tell me how this is possible.
It's not. I spoke with the prison authorities.
He's in lockdown.
Look, stun-gun marks,
right there, just like Hoyt's victims.
Any sick perp could've done this
if he watched the TV news and read a paper.
We got a copycat.
Except we didn't release this detail.
Hoyt's trained an apprentice.
Hey, uh, can I get a scanner from you? Thank you.
He's coming out of rigor. You want us to crack him?
No, put him on his side.
Hoyt's the reason you don't want to be partners, isn't he?
You know why...
I'm allergic to all those sad and furry little creatures
you keep rescuing, Detective Dolittle.
You never sneezed.
Hello.
Special agent Gabriel Dean.
You must be Detective Rizzoli.
And you must be Dr. Maura Isles.
What's the FBI doing here?
Saw the homicide advisory... and possible kidnapping.
We have an APB out on Gail Yeager.
Yeah, so do we.
You get a lot of routine advisories.
What so special about this one?
Hey, you know we're on the same side, right?
Are we?
Oh, because, you know, you fed boys,
like to show up, take the bat and the ball.
Just here to observe.
Right.
Jane, I'll be doing the autopsy in the morning.
Okay.
Come if you like.
Hey, Rizzoli.
Yeah?
Semen.
So he raped the wife and made the husband watch...
Just like Hoyt.
Look at me. Look at me!
Jane... how lovely to see you.
Haven't seen you since the trial.
Get his ass in the chair.
I like that scent --
The smell of lavender and fear.
See one. Do one. Teach one.
That's what they taught you in medical school.
Who did you teach, Hoyt?
I dropped out, Jane. I mean, you know that.
You were kicked out... for fondling a corpse.
That's very good, Jane.
You've learned how to irritate me.
I want to see them.
Hands are so useful.
Dexterous.
And yours played the piano. Do they still work?
Good as new.
So...your turn.
You trained somebody, didn't you?
I love...
your neck.
It's so beautiful.
And your breasts...
Very firm.
Answer the question.
Tell me, Jane...
What would you like to do to me?
I'd like to get my gun...
...and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
No, no, no, no, no.
It is so much better slowly, to take your time.
You know, all my life,
I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.
And that bothers me,
because I haven't finished what I started with you.
And you won't, you sick scumbag.
Do you dream about me, Jane?
Because I dream about you.
I don't even think about you.
But I'll tell you what -- I'll visit you every damn day
If you tell me who your friend is.
Who killed Dr.Yeager, where's his wife?
I see that our time's up.
I do dream about you.
Am I ever your lover?
That's enough, you son of a bitch! That's enough!
All right, all right, all right.
You're right, Jane.
I should play fair.
My friend is out there.
Enjoy him.
Because he'll enjoy you.
Rizzoli.
Yeah, OK. We will be right there.
They found Gail Yeager.
Hey, uh, I'll catch up.
Are you wearing lipstick, Rizzoli?
Shut up.
Dog find her?
Yeah. Lucky he got loose.
We wouldn't have found her till summer.
Who's a good boy?
How'd you get here so fast?
I was in the area.
Everybody's so lucky today.
Vitreous potassium.
Helps us determine postmortem interval.
Nice and clear -- about 36 hours.
Look at the body, the way it's laid out --
Like she's taking a nap or reading a novel.
It's odd, isn't it?
Yeah, why didn't he bury her?
Didn't have time.
That means something.
Where's Frost?
Ah, paperwork.
Oh. Wiping his face with it after he puked?
Did you do a wet prep yet?
I hadn't planned to. But I can.
Those little guys really are swimmers.
Quite fresh.
Deposited postmortem.
How did you know?
I didn't.
Yes, you did.
It's not standard procedure
to check for evidence of necrophilia.
You want to tell us why you're really here?
I'd like a copy of your report -- as a courtesy.
Let's go, Hoyt. You got your one hour on the yard.
He's faking. Be careful.
I found carpet fiber on Gail Yeager's body.
Lab is processing it.
Thanks.
Hoyt didn't meet his apprentice in prison
or medical school -- all 80 classmates are clean.
You guys eating cat food?
Yeah, you want some?
No.
Guess it's a chick thing.
What's up?
You may want to sit down.
No. Tell me.
A few hours ago, uh,
Charles Hoyt escaped custody.
Oh, my god.
Why wasn't he cuffed?
Two doctors have assured me he was suffering from appendicitis.
200 milligrams of decadron
would give him an abnormal white-cell count.
It mimics all the symptoms.
Doesn't explain how he got out of here.
What's he doing?
It's a message for me.
Go stay with mom and dad.
No. I am staying in my own home.
He's not gonna do this to me again.
Frost, go get some sleep.
I'm fine.
If I was a guy, you wouldn't be worried like this.
You're not a guy.
No, I am a homicide detective.
And he is not gonna kill me.
Really? Well, he almost did the last time.
I mean, look at your hands!
Hey, Frankie, come on.
Please take him.
We'll be outside.
All right, all right, that's the way you want it, fine.
But if you have a boyfriend over, we'll know.
How's that?
Hey, Marisa.
I'm so sorry. Did the vacuum cleaner wake you?
No, no. I was up studying.
Uh, come in, come in, come in.
How's law school?
Awful.
Remind me again why I thought I wanted to be a lawyer.
I know, right? "Where the hell was I on career day?"
Just making sure you're okay.
Um...Yeah. Why would you ask?
You always vacuum when you have a really tough case.
no!
Mom.
That lipstick doesn't flatter you. It's too pink, babe.
Bye.
I hope Frankie junior's okay down there.
Hoyt's not after Frankie, ma.
Your father's out there, also.
Oh, my god, did you bring the dog, too?
Why would I bring the dog?
What, ma?
Oh, come on, it's the middle of the night.
Who could sleep?
Ever since you had this crazy idea
to become a police officer,
I haven't stopped worrying.
I never know if you're coming home.
And your brother Frankie wants to do exactly what you do.
Everything you do, he follows it.
I'm leaving.
You're leaving? Where are you going?
Someplace where you're not.
Jane.
Jane, come on. Be reasonable.
They don't pay you enough money.
I mean-- they don't pay me at all.
Why do you always look like
you're about to do a photo shoot?
Thank you.
God, what is that?!
Shh. You'll scare him.
He's alive?
His name is Bass.
Geochelone sulcata -- african spurred tortoise.
I've had him since he was like this big.
He's partial to british strawberries.
"Bass"?
What, after an old boyfriend?
William M. Bass, the forensic anthropologist
who founded the famous body farm.
Right, yeah, that -- that Bass.
No, it's okay.
Yeah, he's a great pet. Really interactive, I'll bet.
So, how long can a person go without sleeping?
Hallucinations begin by day four,
followed by slurred speech, short attention span, and death.
You're better than wikipedia.
Well, wikipedia is frequently incorrect.
Very little is rigorously peer-reviewed.
Somebody's just dropping something off.
Hey.
Go away. I'm asleep.
Are we having a sleepover,
or is this your way of telling me you're attracted to me?
So it was Dean you were expecting.
He wanted my opinion on another case.
What case?
I can't say.
Fine. Go sleep in your own room.
Jane...
Did you ever like the same guy as your best friend?
No.
Did you ever have a best friend?
No.
You'd tell me if you were a cyborg, right?
No, I don't think I would.
I'm not seeing him.
Yet.
Well, somebody should, don't you think?
Yup.
Should we draw straws?
Couldn't we just show him our tits and let him decide?
It's okay. It's just Bass.
Really, it's okay.
I've never been so scared in all my life.
You look like you slept under an overpass.
How are you still single?
You got to stop this.
Stop what?
This stuff with Frost.
Lab identified the carpet we found on the victim.
It's called Antron.
It -- it's not Frost's fault that he was partnered with me.
Navy-blue carpet from a car.
You want to hear what I got from the lab or not?
Yeah. You want to drink the coffee?
Navy blue's a popular color.
2 million vehicles with this type of carpet fiber.
Swell.
Hey, it's not my fault it's a popular color.
I take three sugar.
Oh, for christ's sake, since when?
Since I don't know -- since for a while.
You'd know that if we were still partners.
What about the semen we found?
No hits.
How is that possible?
Easy. Our unsub's not in CODIS.
Ran the prints we had, too -- nothing.
Our unsub's a ghost.
Pardon me -- yours and Frost's unsub's a ghost.
Thought you said you take three sugar.
Doctor says it's bad for me.
Two sugars is bad for you. The creamer is bad for you.
Like you care.
That's it.
Hey.
About the other day...
I should've given you a heads-up.
It's okay.
No, it -- it's not.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too, Korsak.
Rizzoli.
Where?
Okay, page Frost.
I got to go. They found another victim.
His name is John Ghant. His wife, Karena, is missing.
No sign of a teacup this time. You know what that means.
He didn't need a warning device
because he had an accomplice.
Hoyt.
Jane?
You better come see this.
Hey, all I know is,
I got a delivery for a detective, uh, Rizzoli.
That's me.
Don't worry about that.
Let me see some form of identification.
I got it in my back pocket.
-祝福 亨利·德都波图敬
Hoyt.
Then who's Henry Deduboto?
"Ted Bundy."
That's five letters too many for that anagram.
How do you do that?
Fine, "Theodore Bundy."
He was fascinated with necrophilia,
just like the apprentice.
I bet that's why Gail Yeager's body
was laid out like his lover.
So he could visit.
Any time he wanted.
But we found her, so he had to kill again,
This time with Hoyt.
My guesss Karena Ghant is his new girlfriend.
Frost?
Where?
Keep it off the radio. Take his phone.
Hide your car, all right? I'm on my way.
You are not gonna like what we're about to do.
Only call he made was to 911.
Dispatch put it straight through to me.
Good. What was he doing way out here?
Looking for indian arrowheads.
"Native american."
The Wampanoag tribe was the last to inhabit the area,
also known as the Massachusett.
Get him to a uniform. Take him downtown.
Hold him as long as you can. Call Korsak, all right?
Get him out here. Tell him the plan.
I'm on it.
What plan?
We're gonna surveil this body.
What, you -- you mean, leave her here?
Yes.
I said you wouldn't like it. Let's go.
No. I'm calling my team.
Maura, they weren't expecting anyone to find this body.
Look at where she's hidden. Okay, hear me out.
Hear me out. We get the hell out of here.
We put both the park entrances under surveillance.
What makes you think that Hoyt isn't watching you right now?
He might be. I am willing to take that gamble.
What, by leaving this body here
in hopes that they'll return?
No. No, every second she stays here,
More forensic evidence is lost.
Maura, please.
The faster we get out of here,
the better chance we have of not being discovered.
Okay? 'cause if we don't do this, we got nothing.
If we take this body back now,
All we'll find out is, "Yup, she's dead.
and they killed her."
Please.
Do this for me.
You still got the north entrance, Frost?
Affirmative.
If you want to go sit in his car, go ahead.
Shut up.
Excuse me?
Not you.
And if they come, they're coming at night.
So keep your eyes peeled, all right?
Roger that.
What is the smell?
What smell?
You know what smell. There's an animal in here.
Ugh! Something licked me. What is it?
Oh, it's just Jo Friday.
He's filthy.
"She."
"Joe"?
"Jo," Like "Josephine."
Found her by the side of the road this morning.
Hey, you sneezed.
I told you, I'm allergic.
Korsak, it's either him or me.
What? Please don't.
Hey, what about him?
"Her."
She stays. I got to pee.
You've got to be kidding me.
Nice...doggy.
My god, what have you been in?
You got to go. You got to go.
Later that same day. Come on!
Korsak?
Hey!
Korsak?
Korsak! Come on!
Stay down. Stay down!
Stand! Put your hands on your head now!
Hey, it's me.
What the hell are you doing here?!
I...I was chasing Hoyt.
What do you mean, you were chasing Hoyt?!
How'd you even know he was here?!
Rizzoli.
Korsak?
Hello?
Little help over here. Officer down.
Officer down.
Officer...
Hey, man.
Officer down, officer down.
Give me that.
Where are you?
On the other side of the creek.
What's your location?
He snuck up on me.
Okay, okay.
You're gonna be fine. Are they coming?
Yes, they're coming.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
You're gna be fine. You' gonna be fine.
Let's go.
Push the ambulance here, quick.
Guess where I've been.
How's Korsak?
Fine.
No, he's not fi...he'll be fine.
You told Agent Dean where we were, didn't you?
I did.
Without telling me?
I'm sorry.
Really? You're sorry?
Because I treated a Senior Federal Agent like a perp.
Tackled him, maura, in a creek.
Well, that's unfortunate.
But there is a fine line between courage and stupidity.
Yeah, a fine, thin, blue line.
Thank you.
What? You have a turtle.
Tortoise.
Whatever.
Well, at least give her a bath.
Did you actually tackle him?
Yes, like a linebacker.
Very professional.
You're very brave.
No, I'm simply tired of being afraid.
How did you get past Frost?
He didn't.
Thank you so much.
If you're looking for an apology...
I would know to look elsewhere.
Fine, okay. I'm sorry.
Would you like coffee?
Sure. That'd be great.
Your place is really nice.
You sound surprised.
What, like I live in a sterile little hovel
with my dead plants and my TV dinners?
So...
Question.
Why did Hoyt come after you?
Hoyt's first victim was mine.
And in case you hadn't noticed,
I seem to be Hoyt's favorite type...female.
Oh, yeah, I noticed.
And what happened to your hands?
Why are you so interested in this case?
That's "Need to know."
Seriously? You fed guys actually say that?
I bet you never even once
considered leaving the force, did you?
Sure, I did...
when Hoyt had me pinned to the floor
and a scalpel to my throat.
And now there are two of them,
hunting me down like a pack of wolves.
You want me to stay?
Hmm?
No.
No.
I mean, I don't mean no. I mean no.
Like, no.
Okay. All right.
Well...
Thank you for the coffee.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Good night.
"No"?
God, ma, give it a rest.
Have you been here all day?
Yeah.
Whoa, good.
More caffeine.
Uh, what's my ringtone?
Nice and upbeat.
You should talk to your mom.
She's still mad at me
that I won't come home and sleep in my pink canopy bed.
Mm. I always wanted a pink canopy.
I wanted a horse.
Please don't tell me that
you always wanted to dissect dead people.
Okay, I won't.
I have to go
to the forensics lab at Quantico tomorrow.
In the middle of this?
It's connected to this.
Right. Yeah, here we go again.
Why are you part of the "Need to know" loop and I...
He's trying to kill me.
Jane, this ca--this case is a lot bigger
and it's far more complicated than we thought.
I want to tell you.
Great. Fill me in.
I've been ordered not to.
It involves national security.
Are you kidding me?
Jane. Jane!
Jane, where are you going?
I'm sorry. Am I being a little too loud for you?
Do you ever relax?
No, I don't ever relax! And you know what else?
I've had it up to here with your "Need to know" bullshit.
I've heard "bullshit" before.
Senator Sam Conway,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
Detective Rizzoli.
Sit down.
Where is this?
Kabul, Afghanistan.
It looks like hoyt's work.
A war zone is a serial killer's paradise.
Our apprentice is a soldier?
When we first started investigating these killings,
they looked like war crimes.
So you withheld crucial information
so you could watch
the dumb boston cops run around in circles?
You can blame me for that.
This is a very sensitive investigation.
We believe the apprentice finished his tours,
came to Boston to find Hoyt.
So they could kill together.
That's what it looks like.
Wait. Wait, no.
If our apprentice was a soldier,
we would've gotten a hit on his fingerprints or his DNA
in the military database.
We didn't get a hit.
You ever heard of sheep dipping?
No.
It's when the CIA borrows a soldier
for a black-ops mission.
Green berets were sheep-dipped.
Their identities were wiped from all databases.
So they wouldn't be recognized as American military.
So you think our apprentice
was a green beret working for the CIA?
Yes.
So we train our best men to be killers,
and then we're surprised when they are.
I hate that he's a soldier.
No, that's it.
That's the connection.
What?
You wouldn't know it 'cause it wasn't in the file.
Hoyt used an assumed name to get into
a combat medic training program at Fort Stewart.
That has to be where they met, right?
Yeah, that's worth a shot.
Let's fly to Fort Stewart in the morning.
And...and cross-reference Hoyt's records.
We'll nail both these sons of bitches.
Uh, did you eat dinner?
I can't remember.
Well, are you hungry... for food?
Agent Dean?
Excuse me.
Yeah.
What is it, Maura?
Jane...
I'm in your apartment.
Why?
Jane, they've been...they've been in here.
I'll be right there.
Jane, you were right.
Called in a favor,
got some records from Fort Stewart.
Our apprentice is
special forces officer John Stark, 32.
He did three tours in Afghanistan
as part of a direct action force.
What unit was he assigned to?
618, medical care specialists.
Oh, my god, that's the same as Hoyt.
Stark lives at 400 Chestnut Hill Square.
I'm already sending units.
Okay. Uh, I'll get there as soon as I can.
Detective Rizzoli.
Yeah.
Dr. Isles asked if you'd I.D. The body.
What body?
Sorry, thought you knew.
Dr. Isles said it was your neighbor,
Young female, 20s.
Marisa?
Oh, God, no.
No, come on. No, no.
Hello, Jane.
So nice to see you.
You looking for this?
You know, your problem...
is that your heart...
rules your head.
Where's your little helper?
He's getting ready for our final game.
And I'm so happy to finish...
what we started.
Come take a look.
Oh, Jane.
Did you miss me?
What the...
Dr. Hoyt?
Come on. Charge.
Charge.
Dr. Hoyt?
Dr. Hoyt?
Dr. Hoyt.
We match.
Heard you got second-degree burns.
Yeah, flares are h-hot.
Stark was a decorated soldier.
Makes me sick.
Hoyt kills three people,
so Stark can waltz in
and hide him in a body bag.
You got to be hungry now.
So...
I just want to go home.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll see ya.
Yeah, see ya.
Thank you, though.
Sure.
I wanted you to see for yourself
what extraordinary creatures these are.
Uh...Thanks.
I thought you might need some help cleaning up.
Yeah.
All right, um...
Let me get you some work clothes.
These are my work clothes.
What? You don't like?
Well, they are kind of cute when they're small.
I told you.
So, where do you want me to start?
Come on.
What?
Let's go get a bloody mary.
We always said that we need to do something
outside of a crime scene.
This is a crime scene.
Let's go.
Great.
Uh, but...
Dressed like that?
These are my going-out clothes.
Come on.
