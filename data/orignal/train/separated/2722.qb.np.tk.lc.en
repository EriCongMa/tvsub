even if massarone and 1,000 other snitches pan out ,
we &apos;ve still gotta put tony on trial .
that &apos;s useless until we find out how
they penetrated the anonymous jury system .

tough shit . one of those citizens is a felon .
get on it .

he looks peaceful .
i &apos;m talkin &apos; about his rosary . the medal ?
you think i don &apos;t know what that is ? it &apos;s for opus dei .
the fuck is that about ?
in his later years , your father was very
sensitive about what &apos;s been goin &apos; on in the church .
bullshit ! your wife is into opus dei .
you told colombino to put it there .
you sure about that ?
yes , john , i &apos;m sure .
body &apos;s not even cold .
no respect for anything anymore .
and new jersey housewife fundamentalist shit ? i doubt it , john .
you yourself said i was like another son to him .
i was bein &apos; polite . it was his deathbed .
i should &apos;ve written those words down .
maybe you should have , &apos; cause they don &apos;t mean anything anymore .
you understand what i &apos;m sayin &apos; ?
i saw a huge mushroom cloud
from the shell .
jim campbell might be alive today
if he hadn &apos;t said to me ,
&quot; heffron , you stay here with your gun .
i &apos;m going up . &quot;
all your life ,
you gotta remember what one guy did because he thought it was his job to do
and he took a shot for you .
this shit &apos;s not supposed to run and here i look like a raccoon .
you are irresistible and you know it .
danny said i was clingy .
fuck him . he &apos;s the one with self @-@ esteem issues .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like out there ,
ade . you &apos;re marrying christopher .
he &apos;s handsome , makes money , he &apos;s got great hair .
okay .
you know i love animals , but this thing is so gorgeous .
isn &apos;t it ? my dad almost had a stroke .
but i told him , &quot; hey , asshole , i &apos;m the one taking all the fucking risk here .
i have to fake the invoices . &quot;
sometimes you gotta just take care of yourself , you know ?
sure you do , honey .
come here .
come on . let &apos;s don &apos;t keep your date waiting .
he likes you , i can tell .
we got a white wine for ade .
that &apos;s another apple martini for you .
thank you , my dear .
my seven @-@ and @-@ 7,
and nothing @-@ and @-@ nothing .
don &apos;t listen to him , chrissy .
i think what you &apos;re doing &apos;s brave .
it &apos;s not for everybody .
things are different when you don &apos;t have that crutch , you know ?
we make up for it other ways .
my god , it &apos;s hot in here .
what do you expect ? you &apos;re dancing in a mink coat .
it &apos;s fox .
she &apos;s my fox in a box .
let &apos;s see her box , or maybe her socks .
stupid .
well , i have to wear fur on the outside
on account of being bare everywhere else .
you believe this one ?
no shit .
every place i go , i got substances i can &apos;t enjoy shoved in my face .
but i guess asking you for a little support system
in my own home is way the fuck outta line .
you gotta have some more wine .
seemed to have a good time tonight .

what , tina ?
come on , that cunt &apos;s too full of herself , anyway .
cunt ? she &apos;s my maid of honor , christopher .

so forget about his seeing the twins .
how &apos;s kelly ? how &apos;s she doing ?

i should go see uncle zio .
yeah .
all right .
show him the phone !
yeah .
tony .
i &apos;ll make this fast &apos; cause i know you &apos;re all hungry .
i remember growing up , i was always asking
why i just used to have sisters .
i said to my mother , i said , &quot; can &apos;t you save up something
and then get me a baby brother ? &quot;
and my mother said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with your cousin tony ? &quot;
and she was right , &apos; cause we were brothers .
except , you know , we had the same name .
there was like 50 tonys in the family .
some of you remember this .
my dad &apos;s name was johnny
and his dad &apos;s name was alfred .
and so whenever we were out running around and we &apos;d hear
&quot; tony uncle johnny , &quot; that was for me .
and &quot; tony uncle al , &quot; that was for him .
and there was &quot; tony uncle philly ! &quot; remember ?
right , yeah , yeah .
but ...
he passed away ... buon &apos; anima .
and uncle phil ... uncle phil , he passed away a long time ago , too .
so ... anyway .
tony &apos;s being away ...
has been hard .
but he &apos;s back now ,
for good .
so welcome home .
welcome home .
thank you .
come on , let me hear it . welcome home !
welcome home !
tony , meadow is incredible . she &apos;s a fucking lvy leaguer .
you and carm hit a home run .
yeah .
i &apos;m sure kelly &apos;s all right , wherever she is .
hey , her old man was in prison .
we tried to do everything we could .
i wasn &apos;t around . what could i expect ?
if things had gone different way back when , who knows ?
what do you want from me ?
nothing ! i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s good it wasn &apos;t both of us .
these things happen , right ?
you &apos;re gonna like this place . this is nice .
this is the kind of place we always talked about having .
fucking weird .
my cousin in the old man &apos;s seat .
it &apos;s like sun tizzu says ...
&quot; a good commander is benevolent and unconcerned with fame . &quot;
what ?
sun tizzu . the chinese prince machiavelli .
tony turned me on to him .
tzu , tzu !
sun tzu , you fucking ass @-@ kiss .
feech !
you know i missed you by two weeks at allenwood .
this &apos;ll help you get started .
jesus , you &apos;re on your feet already ?
you hit the ground running and you don &apos;t look back , huh ?
thank you .
come on .
so you in on the bus station project ?
massarone &apos;s waiting on a number .
how &apos;s he doing ?
good .
we had coffee .
he used to bore me , jack .
but he ain &apos;t a bad guy once you get to know him .
i always liked him .
i was very touched by that funeral the other day .
real heart @-@ grabber .
that fucking little carmine .
and after what ?
five years in florida fixing wet t @-@ shirt contests .
m &apos;boy are you fat .
what did you say ?
reginald van gleason iii . &quot; m &apos;boy are you fat . &quot;
that &apos;s good , yeah .
so i got some ideas , you know , for you . get you on your feet .
unless , of course , you already know what you wanna do .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
well , yeah . i kinda got an idea .
yeah ?
like four years in i got moved to springfield .
you know , where they got the big prison hospital .
it &apos;s mostly stab wounds , detox .
anyway , this guy i knew from elkton , he was telling me
how i could be an orderly , you know ?
and how it &apos;s easy time and all .
well , you know , so then you &apos;re the guy that hooks everybody up . that &apos;s smart .
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t business for me .
i mean i really got into this shit .
rehab block had guys with broken limbs , muscle diseases
and we &apos;d help them back .
so , i think this might be a thing i can do .
i got my associate &apos;s degree already . took me five years .
and now it &apos;s only like six months more for my massage license .
so you wanna run a massage parlor ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna be a licensed massage therapist .
look , i &apos;ve been away from all this a long time .
i mean if i got a shot at staying out and putting shit together ,
i should take it .
&apos;cause i was thinking , you know ,
i got this air @-@ bag thing going ...
oh , tony , thanks , but ... i mean it &apos;s a really nice offer ,
but i need regular work until i &apos;m certified .
just regular work .
well , i guess i know this guy looking for ...
a delivery man for his linen fleet .
bobby gociletto ?
no , no , no , koreans .
you know , i don &apos;t got my driver &apos;s license .
so you &apos;ll go to my guy at the dmv .
as far as the union shit , i can take care of that .
wow , tony . thanks . thank you .
you &apos;re the best , you know that ?
yeah , yeah .
out .
why ?
because we are watching a movie and you are studying .
and why must we keep having that conversation ?
here it is . on the american film institute &apos;s greatest american movies list .
&quot; citizen kane . &quot;
jesus , it &apos;s black and white .
that is what film club is all about ... trying new things .
now , to give us some background ,
let &apos;s see what leonard maltin has to say .
&quot; a film that broke all the rules and invented some new ones .
the cinematography , music and oscar @-@ winning screenplay
by welles and herman j @-@ something are all first rate . &quot;
so it was a sled , huh ? he should &apos;ve told somebody .
i think it &apos;s fascinating the man had all that stuff ,
but he died alone with nothing and nobody .
good . prick .
i hated it . &quot; you supply the war . i &apos;ll supply the headlines . &quot; how conceited .
there was the cinematography .
yeah , that was very good .
what ?
i saw laura basi in the dressing room at loehmann &apos;s .
definitely had some work . d @-@ cup at least and a lift .
well , she said she was remodeling her upstairs . but i had no idea .
so , carm , how you doing ?
i &apos;m okay .
my lawyer , he &apos;s a top guy ... robert greenberg .
he says that new jersey has this equitable distribution law .
so apparently 20 years entitles me to at least half his money .
well , it should . you made tony a home ,
you raised his children . does this guy know how to get it ?
well , it &apos;s mostly cash , obviously .
god , all those years and you could get nothing .
this other lawyer , dan minditch says that we should play hardball .
you know , go after the real assets .
marriage is beautiful in the beginning , but two , three years later ?
you &apos;d think there &apos;d be some romance at least .
janice , you &apos;re a newlywed .
i know .
six months and bobby still hasn &apos;t found my rosebud .
maybe he should hire a reporter .
so the movie &apos;s over and they all start talking about their marriages
and how miserable they are .
bitterness .
so besides the movie night ?
you have kids ?
no .
so did you attend carmine lupertazzi &apos;s funeral ?
i didn &apos;t know him .
movie night was fun , though .
who was there at the tony blundetto homecoming ?
i told you , just family .
god , is that all you think about is your fucking work ?
you don &apos;t care how i feel about anything .
okay .
i was married to an agent .
what happened ?
did he cheat on you ?
while we were trying to get pregnant he climbed right over me ...
to become an assistant supervisor on the milken task force .
moved to los angeles and jumped a pay grade without me .
my god , that &apos;s terrible .
so where were we ?
what am i doing ? i can &apos;t talk to you .
i can &apos;t even talk to christopher and he &apos;s my soul mate for god &apos;s sake .
i can &apos;t talk to my friends .
i am being ripped apart here just snitching on people .
for what ? what do i get out of it ?
take some comfort in the fact that you &apos;re trying to do the right thing
by helping your government .
no , seriously .
for me , it was when i was in college .
my sister &apos;s boyfriend kyle traded our tv for six handguns .
he sold five to a high school kid then used the last one to open a coconut .
the ricochet left my sister a paraplegic .
i knew i had to do something about guys like him .
and nowhere but the fbi is the
line clearer between the good guys and the bad guys .
and you &apos;re with the good guys now .
tb .
i didn &apos;t call for no linen delivery .
what do i find at the pork store ? a bunch of guys beating the meat .
wanna deal me in ?
absolutely .
stakes might be a little high for you .
you know you can &apos;t pay us in napkins .
you got to let that dry before you put on a second coat ?
fucking grandpa monster over here .
you gonna deal those ?
they &apos;re not candy bars . you can let some of &apos; em go .
what the fuck &apos;s that for ? drying shirts ?
it &apos;s a tao master massage chair .
i had no idea i was so tense .
it &apos;s like my back is on vacation .
well , it could definitely use one .
what the fuck is this ?
hey t , you gotta try this .
he &apos;s really fucking good .
nothing like being in the joint to teach you how to ease another man &apos;s tensions .
jesus christ , i &apos;m gone for one hour .
all of a sudden it turns into a fucking slumber party .
somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed .
could i talk to you a minute ?
none of your fucking business which side of the bed i wake up on .
jesus , it &apos;s just an expression .
bullshit . don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
all that reggie van gleason , &quot; m &apos;boy are you fat . &quot;
things have changed around here . i &apos;m the boss of this fucking family .
you &apos;re crowding me .
you don &apos;t make fun of me . got it ?
got it .
and knock off the massage shit .
it &apos;s a place of business , not a jack lalanne .
you gotta declare all that ?
most of it , anyway .
well , if you had a good bookkeeper ...
hey , you got change ?
been fucking sliding this stupid
bill in and out of the cigarette machine for like an hour .
an hour ? i bet you can go longer than that .
listen to you . why do you always talk like a whore ?
because men like it .
yeah ?
i think you &apos;re right about that .
i &apos;m telling you i &apos;m having a fucking time .
stay out late , come home drunk , fuck anyone i want .
yeah , so what &apos;s the difference ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a mindset .
tony , i was hoping you &apos;d be here . i gotta tell you ,
you shouldn &apos;t eat up there in fairfield no more .
what the fuck you talking about ?
i went to collect from my cop up there and he gave me a heads up .
his buddy on the force saw some
car out by napoleon &apos;s diner a couple of weeks ago .
and i remembered how your goomah lives up there .
yeah ?
guy thought maybe they were fags ,
but he ran the plate and it bounced back a no @-@ hit .
feds .
cop said they were just sitting there in the rain .
they always do that , but i know it wasn &apos;t me they tailed that night
&apos;cause my whole life &apos;s in the fucking rear view .
mine , too .
absolutely .
it &apos;s massarone . aw , jesus christ .
if he flipped i &apos;d be fucked .
we all would .
well he ain &apos;t been to the grand jury ,
because we would have heard from our girl up there .
they could be just following him at this point ,
see if they could get anything on him .
yeah , and eventually they &apos;ll bring him in .
they &apos;ve turned a lot fucking tougher guys than jack massarone .
you want me to take care of it ?
no , we don &apos;t know shit yet , right ?
he did give me that fucking painting , though .
there was that , tony .
can &apos;t a guy be fucking nice anymore ?
friendly ?
so what do you wanna do ?
i wanna be absolutely fucking sure .
that &apos;s what i wanna do . we arrange a meet . i &apos;ll feel him out a little bit .
i gotta do it . i know the guy . i know the way he thinks .
i know the way he acts .
my old man was very good at vibing people out , too .
if massarone &apos;s up to something i &apos;ll pick it up .
you piece of shit . i don &apos;t believe this .
hold on .
yeah .
i just wanted to thank you for taking the components out of the home theater .
hey , i bought that for us to watch movies as a family , okay ?
not to entertain your girlfriends .
i talked to my lawyer about filing a separation agreement .
i &apos;m not paying a lawyer .
we should be able to settle this thing like adults !
then stop taking shit out of the house !
hey tony , what &apos;s up ?
