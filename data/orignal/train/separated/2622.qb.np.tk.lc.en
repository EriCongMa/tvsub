i went out for a smoke , and he was here .
what the hell .
if you let this guy go ,
he &apos;s going to the cops .
we are all going to jail ,
starting with you .
keen .
detective martin wilcox , metro p.d.
i &apos;m looking into this missing @-@ persons case .
lieutenant ames , d.c. harbormaster .
i had no idea tom would kill him .
was there witnesses ?
just want to ask you a few questions ,
then you &apos;re free to go .
you are samuel aleko .
i know you were there .
my father was killed because of the fulcrum ,
because you and your people came for it that night .
this charade ...
of you pretending to care about me
was a waste of your time
because i don &apos;t know where it is .
i have a safe . it &apos;s in st.petersburg.
the number from the safe
traces to a blind exchange .
we can &apos;t identify the party you &apos;ll be speaking to .
who the hell is this ?
our suspect is patient , calm .
he likely spends hours scouting the prey .
he &apos;s only interested in big men ,
the ones who are hard to take down ,
like the big bucks in the wild .
now , you &apos;re looking for an incredibly smart offender ,
highly organized .
white male , likely 35 to 40 .
it is the sport that he &apos;s seduced by ,
the ritual of the hunt .
when he does finally make his move , it happens fast ,
striking in a blitz @-@ style attack most never see coming .
his heart @-@ shot prey
rarely make it over 100 feet before bleeding out .
that moment is everything to him --
the rush of control .
the typical mutilation killer
focuses on a specific area of the anatomy
that suits their interest --
the face , the eyes or mouth ,
the extremities , hands , breasts , genitalia .
but this one &apos;s different --
he &apos;s interested in total domination of the body .
he guts them ,
removing the organs with surgical precision ,
but then leaving them in a pile .
but these aren &apos;t sex crimes ,
which indicates they are instead crimes of domination ,
an effort on his part to gain control over men
who , based on their physical similarities ,
represent a man who once had dominance over him --
a father , an older brother .
it is my belief that &quot; the deer hunter &quot; is , in fact ,
a very slight , rather weak man .
yes , blue shirt .
they say he takes a souvenir .
it &apos;s not a souvenir , it &apos;s a final act of domination .
while his prey &apos;s body is still warm ,
he carves out the liver and takes a single ceremonial bite .
第93号
man , we had a deal .
i testify against keen and her husband ,
i tell you how they killed the harbormaster ,
and i walk .
yeah , you will walk , when the trial &apos;s over .
until then , you &apos;re being charged as an accessory .
i told you everything .
yeah .
and because of that , you &apos;re gonna be the star witness
in the murder trial of fbi agent elizabeth keen .
you &apos;re gonna testify in open court .
you &apos;re gonna testify before the grand jury .
you &apos;re gonna be deposed until you &apos;re blue in the face .
and if you change your story by so much as a comma ,
your immunity deal will be voided
and you &apos;re gonna go to prison for the rest of your life .
am i clear ?
yeah .
yes ?
sorry i cut our previous call short .
i was not confident the line was secure .
tell me your name .
not yet .
then you have me at a disadvantage .
yes .
alan fitch directed me to that safe .
your number was inside .
he wanted us to talk . why ?
what does he want me to know ?
it is happening .
what is ?
what &apos;s happening ?
no , not like this -- in person .
2 p.m. tomorrow .
broadway and 92nd .
center island , south side .
a graduate seminar .
was there a slide show ?
we need to talk about the fulcrum .
i told you , i don &apos;t know anything about it .
elizabeth , one of the reasons i &apos;m still alive
is due to my love of reading ,
whether it be words on a page
that reveal the author &apos;s thoughts , emotions , imagination ,
or whether it be people in conversation ,
and instead read their expression , posture ,
their gesture .
lizzy , you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not .
what if we made a deal ?
i help you find your serial killer ,
and you tell me about the fulcrum .
you &apos;re not even interested in serial killers .
true .
i find them unimaginative
and woefully predictable .
but i am interested
in the cases that you and the fbi have wrong .
wrong ?
the most critical assumption
you &apos;re making about the deer hunter
is wrong .
do we have a deal or not ?
this brute they call &quot; the deer hunter &quot;
isn &apos;t a buck at all , but instead a delicate doe .
a woman ?
i disagree with you .
okay .
but your killer attacks from a distance ,
indicating the predator &apos;s smaller ,
perhaps unable to overpower their prey .
men tend to kill in close proximity --
strangulation , blunt instrument , a knife .
by contrast , women tend to favor
weapons that can be used from further away --
poison , a gun , a crossbow .
richard kuklinski was 6 &apos; 5 , &quot;
300 pounds ,
and one of his favorite weapons of choice was cyanide .
yes , but male serial killers
are predominantly , overwhelmingly
sexually sadistic .
in this case ,
there is not the slightest indication of a sexual motive .
aileen wuornos was a prostitute
who lured her victims in with the promise of sex .
the deer hunter has been active for over a decade ,
from the truck driver in des moines in 2003
to the doorman in adams morgan last night .
that &apos;s 12 years .
the average length of a killing spree for a man
is two , perhaps three .
yes , agent keen , for every rule there is an exception .
each factor , taken separately , is not conclusive ,
but put them together and it &apos;s clear --
you haven &apos;t found your man because he &apos;s a woman .
uh , agent keen , uh , the m.e. called .
he just finished his autopsy on the latest victim .
i used to have a teeming mane just like that .
thank you .
every kill is identical .
same clean incisions at the stomach and the liver ,
same knots binding the anus .
no variations ?
when field dressing &apos;s done well , it &apos;s like an autopsy .
the way he opens subjects , i want to show you ...
what is it ?
i left that body covered .
the hallway . that was him ! he was at my lecture !
hey , you !
brown coat , stop !
hands where i can see them !
okay , okay , okay !
don &apos;t move !
it &apos;s just my phone !
hands !
okay .
it &apos;s just my phone , okay ?
stop looking at me like that .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s not -- i don &apos;t like it any more than you do .
but someone has to do this !
this is chad henning .
mommy has to go across town to see him
to see chad henning .
i won &apos;t be long .
what the hell were you doing in the m.e. &apos; s office ?
i told you , i write &quot; metro crime diary . &quot;
that &apos;s why i was at your lecture -- research .
there &apos;s no research in that rag sheet .
it &apos;s gossip and innuendo .
so , what were you really doing there ?
you used fake credentials to get into the m.e. &apos; s office .
you took my phone .
you know all i was doing was taking pictures .
you &apos;re obsessed with serial killers .
you write about them all the time .
how do we know you &apos;re not the deer hunter ?
you &apos;re not looking for the deer hunter .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
the first six victims ,
mark rodgers through perry holloman ,
he was experimenting .
the field dressing became cleaner ,
he switched from a folder to a field blade --
we didn &apos;t overlook that . he was learning , evolving .
evolving implies that he wanted to improve .
are you saying he didn &apos;t ?
the techniques and incisions used on the last six victims
are all identical .
the deer hunter loved to explore .
there &apos;s no way he would repeat himself .
you think we &apos;re dealing with a copycat .
the deer hunter is an artist .
the guy you &apos;re looking for is a forger .
keen .
agent keen ?
i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s detective wilcox .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if you remember me . we -- we spoke some time ago .
yes , detective .
i remember you were looking into the disappearance
of the d.c. harbormaster .
yeah . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not a missing @-@ persons case anymore .
we recovered the body .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
i was hoping for better news .
yeah .
i @-@ i need you to tell me what you know .
i would like to , detective , but as i told you ,
the reason i came into contact with the harbormaster --
t @-@ the case i was working on at the time --
it &apos;s classified .
that &apos;s not gonna fly anymore .
see , the thing is , recovering the body
is not the only development in the case .
i also found ... samuel aleko .
he places you at the scene , agent keen --
you and your ex @-@ husband .
he tells quite a story .
says the two of you are stone @-@ cold killers .
even if i wanted to answer your questions ,
before i could talk , you would need to get --
a federal judge to rule that my investigation supercedes your case .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s in the works .
an ausa &apos;s gonna sit down with mr. aleko ,
hear what he has to say .
and i @-@ i have no doubt that , as a result of that conversation ,
a petition &apos;s gonna be filed in federal court
requesting that i have complete access
to any of your allegedly classified information .
this conversation is over .
well , i @-@ i @-@ i think it &apos;s just beginning .
hello , edgar .
mr. reddington .
samuel aleko will be transferred tomorrow afternoon .
that &apos;s not gonna work .
look , he has to talk to the guy . this is the window .
he leaves the &quot; v &quot; street station between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 .
you have to reschedule the transfer .
there &apos;s somewhere else i need to be .
look , you know i &apos;d do anything for you , mr. reddington ,
but , i mean , this thing &apos;s in motion .
this is the window . it is what it is .
cinnamon @-@ nut crumble ?
brown @-@ sugar pecan .
oh , my .
lucinda knows how you love her coffee cake .
oh , i do .
be well , edgar , and tell lucinda
if she ever leaves you , i &apos;d like to marry her .
just remember , tomorrow between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 .
i &apos;ve been through every case file ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if kruse doesn &apos;t have a point .
i mean , the last six kills are identical .
we assumed that was because he &apos;d perfected his craft ,
that there was no room for improvement .
but the more i look at it , the more i think we &apos;re wrong ,
that there really is a copycat .
i just can &apos;t prove it .
what is it ?
what ?
nothing .
come on , keen . what is it ?
i know you better than that . where &apos;s your head ?
that cop , the one investigating the harbormaster ?
he &apos;s got evidence .
he found the body .
and the witness .
did he talk ?
i think he did , yes .
it &apos;s your word against his .
i &apos;ve hidden behind the task force for as long as i can ,
told him i couldn &apos;t talk because it was classified ,
but he &apos;s taking the case to a federal judge .
ton is the one who kill this guy .
but i was there .
i should have ...
what , stopped him ?
liz , you tried .
they &apos;ll have enough to arrest me .
then go to cooper , ask him to talk to the ausa .
the last thing he wants is some cop poking around
asking questions about what we do .
liz , listen to me .
tom may have killed this guy ,
but &quot; fbi agent goes to prison &quot; is the headline .
all they &apos;re gonna care about is taking a bite out of y--
that &apos;s it .
what ?
kruse was right about the copycat .
i can prove it .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t mean to second @-@ guess you .
oh , mary , please . you have nothing to apologize for .
it &apos;s just -- my son .
if anything were to happen to me --
nothing &apos;s going to happen to you or your son .
it &apos;s entirely natural for you to feel this way ,
to have second thoughts .
if you didn &apos;t , i &apos;d be very concerned .
if there was any other way ...
you &apos;ve tried every other way .
you &apos;ve been reasonable , worked within the system ,
begged , pleaded .
i know , but --
mary , look at me .
is there evil in your life ?
yes .
is it not just and right to eliminate evil ?
say it .
yes .
so ...
are you in , or are you out ?
i need to know , because if this comes back on me ,
it &apos;s going to come back on us both .
do you understand ?
i &apos;m in .
well , that &apos;s good .
then it &apos;s done .
i pulled the forensics like you asked
and had the lab compare the bite marks left on each liver .
for the first six kills with those from the last six .
what are you doing ?
what ? um , nothing . i &apos;m updating the team .
aram ?
yeah ?
the bite marks .
right .
uh , turns out , the , uh , distance measurements on the upper arch
are 2.8 % wider in the first six victims than in the second six .
two different bites at the proverbial apple .
nice work , ressler .
so , it &apos;s official -- we &apos;re looking for a copycat .
okay , are you sure you have your glasses ?
yes .
okay , well mrs. jost called me again
about you squinting at the blackboard all day .
it &apos;s why you keep getting those headaches .
mom , it &apos;s not the glasses .
mrs. jost just has crappy handwriting .
language .
okay , now , don &apos;t forget ,
your father is gonna pick you up after ...
elsa , honey , what is it ? the bus is here .
oh , my ...
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
how long were the two of you married ?
five years , together almost nine .
i just ...
this can &apos;t be happening .
the ... deer hunter , right ?
the killer on the news ?
yes .
of course , we &apos;re limited in what we can disclose ,
but the deer hunter has a very specific method of operation .
the manner of death , the treatment of the body ...
it &apos;s consistent with his profile .
i knew something was wrong .
chad works in construction , and he didn &apos;t come home after work .
we have a son . he &apos;s only 4 . what am i supposed to tell him ?
you tell him ...
we &apos;re gonna find whoever did this .
how ?
according to the papers , you don &apos;t even have a suspect .
we have some promising new theories .
actually , one in particular ...
we believe this may not be the work of the actual deer hunter .
we think it &apos;s a copycat .
we really shouldn &apos;t ...
no , it &apos;s okay .
she deserves to know .
we &apos;re getting closer to the truth .
that &apos;s ...
thank you .
no , thank you .
we appreciate your time .
i can only imagine how difficult this must be for you .
what the hell was that ?
she was covering .
i don &apos;t know what , but that woman knows something .
yeah , i picked up on that , keen ,
but since when
do you hand a person of interest your profile ?
my profile is wrong .
there was nothing specific
connecting the original deer hunter &apos;s victims
other than the physical ,
but the copycat , his victims ...
you think the copycat &apos;s targeting a specific type of victim ?
what if he is ?
i had assumed he was operating like the original killer ,
but what if he chose those victims
based on a different unifying reason ?
he could be masking his agenda
by making it look like the work of a different serial killer .
well , maybe there &apos;s something in the victims &apos; histories we missed .
but how does mary henning fit in ?
don &apos;t know yet .
but i rattled her .
we should let her stew and take another run at her tomorrow .
yes ?
who the hell are you ?
mr. reddington asked me to ...
why are you wearing a sidearm ?
he needs to reschedule .
no , no . that &apos;s not how it works .
i told him to come alone .
i gave very specific instructions .
mr. reddington &apos;s a man of his word .
if it were possible , he would be here .
wherever he is , whatever the hell he &apos;s doing ,
i hope it &apos;s important .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
hang tight , pal .
90 seconds .
when i was young ,
i wanted to be able to dance just like gary goddard .
i still remember going to the snowflake dance
and watching him for the first time .
that kid , man , he could move .
won the eighth @-@ grade talent show .
he was on the yell squad .
gary even danced his way into helen hummer &apos;s pants ,
and let me tell you something ,
that was like breaking into fort knox .
pops , who the hell are you ?
then in the summer of &apos; 88,
i saw gary in the diaper aisle at safeway .
he looked like hell .
gray .
out of breath , fatigued .
turns out gary had a bad bicuspid valve ,
needed a heart transplant .
he was on the wait list until the day he died .
how long has isaac been on the list now ?
how do you know about my brother ?
six months ?
a year ? two ?
how long is he gonna have to wait ?
they won &apos;t say .
i can get your brother a heart within the week .
best surgeons , best post @-@ op care ,
and it won &apos;t cost you a dime .
why would you do that for me ?
because you &apos;re gonna do something for me .
we found the link , or at least what could be the link .
we have seven victims ,
so we started over with the most basic question .
&quot; do they know each other ? &quot;
right , but that theory died quickly .
there are seven victims all from different states ,
different ages , no schools in common , no family relations .
so , they &apos;re not connected ,
but something about them is ?
makes sense , but everything we tried was a bust .
and then it hit me --
maybe the one thing we know about the victims
is the one thing holding us back .
maybe the victims aren &apos;t victims -- not entirely .
joseph riggs , the copycat &apos;s second target .
the guy had a rap sheet ,
including a conviction for misdemeanor menacing .
he pointed a knife at his girlfriend ,
said he &apos;d kill her if she left him .
which brings us to target four ,
andrew cosgrove .
divorced from his second wife , diane .
the transcript for a family court proceeding
makes reference to a restraining order .
okay , so that &apos;s two . what about the others ?
number five , judd liggett .
no criminal record , but a year before he was murdered ,
he was disciplined
by the graduate school program he was attending .
let me guess -- after complaints were made by a female student .
aggravated harassment .
nonstop phone calls , stalking her in class .
the girl was terrified , but no criminal charges were filed .
that &apos;s why it wasn &apos;t on our radar .
stalkers , obsessive types ,
men who get violent when the women they want reject them .
that &apos;s what mary henning was hiding --
she was afraid of her husband .
whoever killed him might have been protecting her .
if we &apos;re right ,
these seven men had dangerous fixations on seven women .
the copycat killer was protecting those women .
yeah , but those women were in five different states .
how did the killer even know they were in danger ?
hang on a sec .
diane cosgrove got legal help with her divorce
from a local nonprofit called docket one .
uh , the student advocacy group that went after judd liggett
was called ...
bright voice .
bright -- bright voice .
they &apos;re both affiliates
of a national organization called ...
whitehaven shelters .
we are the largest nonprofit victims &apos; assistance association
in the u.s.
every year , there are 7 million victims
of harassment and stalking .
we help to provide those people
with legal , medical , and social services .
do you keep records of the people you provide assistance to ?
of course . why ?
it &apos;s our understanding that these seven women
obtained aid from your whitehaven affiliates .
we &apos;d like to know everything we could
about your interaction with them .
as you can imagine , we take privacy very seriously here .
i assume you have a court order .
we &apos;ll get one if necessary .
unless there &apos;s some kind of danger
of imminent threat or harm , i don &apos;t feel comfortable --
are you familiar with chad henning ?
name sounds familiar .
it should .
his body was found hanging from a tree this morning
in takoma park .
you &apos;re talking about the serial murders .
chad henning was the husband of mary henning ,
a woman who received legal counsel
from a free clinic provided by whitehaven .
in fact , all the names on that list
were in relationships with victims of the deer hunter .
the only other thing those seven women have in common
is your organization .
it &apos;s quite possible that the person committing these murders
interacted with these women through whitehaven .
we &apos;re gonna need a full list of your employees and volunteers
of the last five years .
i &apos;ll get you everything i can .
just give me a few hours to put it together .
thank you .
i know , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m overreacting , right ?
i mean , i don &apos;t know if she talked with the fbi .
but if mary did talk ,
she &apos;d expose everyone .
and i don &apos;t care about myself .
but the other women ...
i have to do something , right ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m overreacting .
i should just relax .
she &apos;d never betray me . none of them would .
the last victim &apos;s wife , the one you let stew ,
apparently you did a really great job ,
because she is boiling over .
she called ?
just got off the phone with her .
she wants to talk .
let &apos;s go , keen .
look , if you &apos;re here because you want to give me
more unsolicited advice about my case ...
tempting as that may be ,
i &apos;m here to speak to agent mojtabal .
no one ever calls me that .
aram ...
i need your assistance locating the source of a call
that was placed to a pay phone
at 92nd and broadway .
i need a warrant .
you won &apos;t need a warrant .
of course i won &apos;t need a warrant .
this is the number .
the call was placed at exactly 2 : 00 p.m. yesterday .
aram ?
yes .
i can &apos;t stress enough the urgency of this matter .
thank you for coming . i ...
tracy , hello .
i was expecting someone else .
we have a situation .
what is it ? what happened ?
the fbi found the connection .
they came to whitehaven ...
asking for the names of every employee .
the fbi , they came ,
but i didn &apos;t say anything , i promise .
who were you expecting ?
friends for book club .
oh , you &apos;re lying .
it &apos;s you . you &apos;re the weak link .
after what you &apos;ve done for me , for us ?
tracy , honestly , before you , i was in a desperate situation .
you saw the marks . he threatened to kill me .
i tried the police , all the right channels ,
and no one lifted a finger .
i &apos;m grateful to you .
i would never betray you .
you ...
hello , miss henning ?
miss henning ?
i &apos;ll take the back .
miss henning , fbi .
miss henning ?
keen !
it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
think .
did ressler get a visual from the witness ?
no . she &apos;s still unconscious .
i &apos;ve been screening service providers --
therapists , lawyers , doctors ,
anyone who &apos;s worked with the wives of our copycat &apos;s victims .
someone connecting the women .
right , but i got nothing .
then i took a look at whitehaven &apos;s employees and volunteers .
at one time or another , all of the victims &apos; wives
reached out to one of whitehaven &apos;s affiliates
for assistance .
legal , medical , financial --
that &apos;s how he &apos;s finding his victims .
all but one .
in every case , their husbands were murdered by the copycat
after they sought help ,
except her
tracy solobotkin .
特蕾西 · 索罗伯特金 会计
her husband was the first victim of our copycat ,
and she was hired over three months after his death .
why after ? her problem was already solved .
maybe she wanted to help women
who were still in bad relationships .
maybe she wanted to help other women end them .
says here she works in accounting ,
which would give her access to the names of every woman
who got assistance from whitehaven .
perfect opportunity for her to identify violent spouses .
talk about a target @-@ rich environment .
i &apos;m on my way .
get a bolo out on all vehicles registered to tracy solobotkin .
we got a code nine .
deploy every available unit to her address .
i don &apos;t want to do this , but i have to .
nobody can connect me to mary but you .
m.e. won &apos;t buy it . victimology &apos;s all wrong .
the deer hunter killed men .
is that what you call them ? men ?
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen this way .
i didn &apos;t want to hurt mary or anybody else ,
anybody but them !
i understand .
maybe a jury will .
that &apos;s what i said .
to the deer hunter , the real one .
he was my husband .
my god . his father was a bastard ...
pushing him , pushing him ,
picking on him , cutting him down .
he didn &apos;t want to face what he was ,
so he overcompensated .
always pretending ...
macho , tough ...
trying too hard with the ladies , but i knew .
after we got married , there &apos;s --
you know , there &apos;s nothing that can hide that .
you &apos;d think that after his father died ,
that he &apos;d come to grips with it .
he got angry ,
mean , isolated .
every weekend on hunting trips --
that &apos;s what he called them .
you had no idea .
after the separation , i was staying at my sister &apos;s .
i came by the house one night to get my things .
i thought he was gone ,
but he was in here , in the garage .
he had blood on his mouth , on his clothes .
the deer hunter had been all over the news .
so , in that moment , i knew ...
what he &apos;d done .
and i tried to leave , but ...
but he came towards me .
he knew i knew , so he couldn &apos;t let me go .
and i &apos;d never held a weapon .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i &apos;d fended him off with a knife before , but that ?
i never held a bow .
before i knew it , the arrow went straight through his heart .
and i thought about calling the police ,
turning myself in , but then i realized ...
you could continue .
you could ...
well , yeah .
all those women whitehaven had helped , just like me --
i could give them their lives back by becoming him .
and it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s hard work .
it &apos;s filthy work , but it &apos;s worth it ...
just to he-- just to see them scared for a change ,
to hear them whimper and ...
and -- and beg .
all the things after --
you know , with the cutting , the mess --
i hated it .
but i @-@ i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;m sick .
i know .
disgusting , but that &apos;s the way ron did it ,
so i have no choice .
i mean , from -- f @-@ from beyond the grave ,
he still pulls the strings .
okay .
you got to do what you got to do .
but can you please , please just do me one favor ?
yes ?
shut the hell up and get it over with .
what ? you think i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re really doing this ?
you think i &apos;m buying this whole
&quot; justice for victims &quot; crap ?
well , it &apos;s true .
you &apos;re just like your husband .
i &apos;m nothing like my husband !
you &apos;re exactly like him ,
like all the sick , psychopathic animals we lock up .
oh , you haven &apos;t heard a word that i &apos;ve been saying .
i &apos;ve heard every word .
&quot; i could give them back their lives . &quot;
why don &apos;t you just admit it ?
you get off on killing people .
it doesn &apos;t matter if the victim &apos;s a scumbag or a saint --
you get off just the same , just like your husband .
tom , no ! let him go !
keen !
keen ! stop .
keen , don &apos;t .
you okay ?
yeah . fine .
back there , uh ...
i can &apos;t do this .
maybe you need some time , a couple weeks .
when &apos;s the last time you took a vacation ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i would have killed her if you hadn &apos;t shown up .
you would have done what you had to do to survive .
same as on the boat .
no , that was different . that was tom .
you tried to stop him .
but i didn &apos;t .
i hesitated .
and maybe i thought for just one second
it would be better for me if he were dead .
liz -- - no .
that man had a family .
he had a life .
i &apos;m gonna go to wilcox .
i &apos;m gonna tell him everything .
how many people do you think are alive today
that wouldn &apos;t be if it wasn &apos;t for the work that we do ?
please .
50 ? 100 ?
how many , liz ?
how many families haven &apos;t buried a mother , a father ,
brother , sister ?
children ?
that doesn &apos;t make it right .
no . it &apos;s never gonna be right .
see , the only question is the body count .
so , you go ahead and you nail yourself to a cross ,
and while you &apos;re up there feeling sanctified ,
you consider how many people are gonna die
because this task force gets shut down
and the rest of those animals on reddington &apos;s list
are still out there feeding .
ressler ...
no . don &apos;t .
don &apos;t ask me to feel your pain , liz .
i got more than enough of my own .
do you , samuel aleko , swear under penalty of perjury
that the following is true and correct ?
yeah .
please tell the u.s. attorney exactly what you told me ...
about agent elizabeth keen &apos;s involvement
in the murder of d.c. harbor master eugene ames .
mr. aleko ?
let me remind you , you &apos;re under oath .
i don &apos;t remember .
you confessed that agent keen was present ...
when the harbor master was killed ...
and that she deliberately covered up his death .
that &apos;s what you want me to say . that &apos;s not how it was .
dembe . uh , yes .
uh , mr. reddington said i should call
as soon as i traced the call .
uh , yes , i have an address .
uh , 3130 sheridan road , park slope .
i figured it out .
what ?
what you &apos;re doing .
the hairline .
guys don &apos;t get it --
most women don &apos;t care if men go bald .
no . did you think i --
you &apos;re sexy no matter what .
i &apos;m not going bald . i just -- i have a high hairline .
wait , what ?
did you just say that ...
yep .
just don &apos;t get fat .
do you have a phone ?
spare change ?
there you go .
god bless you , sir . thanks .
it &apos;s gonna be a freeze tonight .
there &apos;s a place about , uh , two blocks up called the grant .
give this to the guy in the cage . his name &apos;s ronnie .
he &apos;ll , uh , cut you a rate .
thank you , officer .
go get a shower . get youself cleaned up .
for sure .
you all right ?
yeah . fine .
what were you thinking
running after a killer alone without backup ?
are you scolding me ?
yes .
yes , i &apos;m scolding you .
that was foolish , lizzy . you could have been --
killed .
exactly that .
killed .
what are you gonna do ?
ground me ? take away my phone privileges ?
you were right about the deer hunter --
he was a man .
and a woman .
we were both half right .
together , we were right .
i have the fulcrum .
tell me what it is , and i &apos;ll tell you where to find it .
i &apos;ve already told you what i can .
to elaborate would place you in grave danger .
i don &apos;t need your protection .
oh , i think you do .
if it weren &apos;t for me , you would have been indicted today .
as it is , you needn &apos;t to worry about the harbor master anymore .
what did you do ?
nobody was hurt , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re concerned about .
in fact , a young man &apos;s life was saved .
i don &apos;t want to hear any more . i &apos;m leaving .
i believe i know the real reason
you don &apos;t want me to have the fulcrum .
that is ... ?
because you &apos;re afraid ...
that once you give it to me ,
you &apos;ll be of no further use to me and ...
you &apos;ll never see me again .
