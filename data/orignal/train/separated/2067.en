Rachel, it's Professor Dunbar.
I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping me
with the Innocence Project.
You want me to help you get an innocent man off death row?
What do you want, Harvey?
Help me protect Mike Ross.
He's in there with a guy I put away,
and the guy is no joke.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to move the guy to another prison.
You want me one-on-one? You got it.
I'm gonna use this, and they're gonna hold you.
No!
What's going on here?
Why'd you come back with a guard?
I didn't do it to get you to forgive me.
I never should have let him in here in the first place.
The time you served while awaiting trial
was never factored into your sentence.
You're eligible for parole in six weeks.
You think I don't know this is your protector's idea
to get me off your back?
Nah, Frank.
Harvey's idea was for me to tell these guys that you're an informant.
I figured out a way to get Mike out early.
What's the catch?
He has to inform on his roommate.
Mike gets him to turn, he's free.
When do you need an answer by?
Yesterday.
And the answer needs to be yes.
Harvey, wait a second.
Where are you going?
Where do you think I'm going?
I'm gonna see Mike.
And I know what you're going to say,
but Mike went to prison so we wouldn't have to,
and now he's in danger from a guy I put away.
So you'll forgive me if I don't stand around and wait
for you to drop the hammer.
You think I like the idea of him rotting in that place?
But if you want this thing to work,
you can't go running up there in the middle of the night.
You heard Cahill. He needs an answer yesterday.
What he needs is results.
And if Mike's lawyer pulls him out of his cell
in the middle of the night, then his roommate
is going to sense there's something wrong
before this thing even gets started.
Fine, but I'm going up there first thing in the morning,
and nothing you say is going to stop me.
Can't sleep?
Not really.
Well, as long as you're up,
might want to think about putting up some pictures of your own
that way yon won't have to keep staring at mine.
How old are they?
Maddy is seven.
Nate just turned five.
They look really sweet.
Yeah...they're great.
How often do you get to see 'em?
I don't.
What do you mean you don't?
Bad divorce or something?
Nah, nah, nothing like that.
We've been married for ten years.
I just--I just don't let 'em come here.
What? Why not?
They shouldn't see their father as a criminal.
Kevin, come on, man.
I know it's hard on them.
It tears me up every single day that I'm here.
But they're kids. They're resilient.
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.
Well, Mike, you don't have kids.
So you don't know.
No. I don't.
But I do know what it's like to be a kid missing his dad.
Please don't tell me your old man abandoned the family.
Both of my parents died in a car accident when I was 11.
Hit by a drunk driver.
Jesus, that's... I'm sorry, Mike.
Yeah, it was a long time ago.
Kevin, I understand the instinct to protect your children,
but what are you protecting them from?
What do you mean?
I mean we've been roommates for a while now.
Don't you think it's time you told me what you're in here for?
Hey, Ross.
Your lawyer's here.
Now?
I'm just the messenger.
You want out of this box or not?
Mr. Bailey, my name is Rachel Zane.
I am a law student at Columbia,
and I'm here to talk to you about your case.
Student?
Yes, we work alongside the Innocence Project
to determine if you have the criteria for an appeal.
Do you know how long I've been sittin' on death row?
12 years. I read your file.
And for the last ten of 'em, I've been writing letters
and begging any lawyer to listen to my story.
And they finally get around to getting back to me,
and they don't even have the courtesy
of sendin' me a real lawyer?
Mr. Bailey, trust me, I will fight for you.
You're a student.
You can't do shit for me.
Well, you know what? You killed two people.
In cold blood.
You know it, and I know it,
and that's why you're in there,
so thank you for making the decision
to not take your case an easy one.
You don't know me.
All you know is what you read in some damn file.
I didn't kill anyone.
I've been saying it for 12 years
and I can prove it.
You're right. I don't know you.
And you don't know me either.
So do you want to take a chance on each other or not?
I need help, Ms. Zane.
So let me help you.
Harvey, what are you doing here?
There's something I need to talk to you about.
Sit down.
What is it?
I just got a visit from Sean Cahill.
About Gallo?
I thought you said he can't get him transferred.
He can't, but it turns out
there's a way he can get you out.
What do you mean "out"?
I mean out,
as in you walk out that front door
and you never look back.
What's the catch?
Mike--
Harvey, you're not here telling me that I can get out
with that look on your face
if there isn't something else.
He needs you to inform on your cellmate.
What?
If whatever you get leads to a conviction on his father-in-law,
he'll commute your sentence and you get to walk.
What'd the guy do?
Who cares what he did?
I care, because if it was so bad,
why didn't Kevin turn on him in the first place?
Mike, what does it matter?
He can get you out.
This is my only friend in here.
I'm not gonna betray him.
Friend? Listen to me, God damn it.
There's someone in here trying to kill you
and I'm giving you a way out.
I'm taking care of Gallo.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that I did what you told me to do.
I threatened to tell people that he was an informant,
but what I also did was found out a way to get him parole.
Parole? Are you crazy?
He's not gonna get parole.
Who's gonna say he deserves it?
You know what, Harvey?
Instead of coming here and telling me to betray my cellmate
because Gallo will never get parole,
maybe you should be helping me get it for him.
I'm never helping that piece of shit do anything,
and this isn't about Gallo and you know it.
No, it's about you telling me to turn on the one guy in here that I trust
based on some plan that Cahill has
that we don't even know will work.
No, Mike.
It's about giving you a chance to get your life back
while it still looks the same.
Now, are you going to take it or not?
Son of a bitch, it's the prune juice all over again.
What the?
Hey, douche stick.
Are you responsible for my mugs being here?
I didn't--I don't--
we didn't have anything else to use.
I don't give a shit!
Take those things and put 'em back where--
Well, if it isn't Louis Shit.
What's happening, boss?
You bastard.
You took my mugs,
and you didn't even have the balls to do it yourself.
I have no idea what you're talking about,
but if something of yours is in here,
it had nothing to do with me.
Really? Why don't you ask the stuttering ass clown?
We needed them for our...
urine tests.
What'd you say?
You peed on my catch phrase?
I don't know what's funnier--
you got a catch phrase or that we peed on it.
I want those mugs sterilized and I want 'em destroyed.
They're your mugs, you do what you want,
but I'm not touching 'em with a ten-foot pole.
You know how much asparagus Luterman eats?
Later, Chief.
How'd it go this morning?
I was petrified.
Death row. How could you not be?
It's not just that.
When I got there, it hit me
that if I do this,
I have a man's life in my hands.
Rachel, you can handle it.
I know I can.
Then why do I get the feeling that something is bothering you?
Because when I got back from there,
I was so angry about what happened to that poor man
that I sat down, I started working on this case,
and I-- I haven't moved since.
I don't understand. Why is that bad?
Because it's the first time since Mike left
that I haven't thought about him every second.
Listen to me.
That's a good thing.
It doesn't feel like a good thing.
Rachel, you can't live your life on pins and needles.
It's not healthy for you.
It's not healthy for Mike. It's not healthy for anyone.
And forgetting about him is healthy?
Isn't that why you took this case?
To give yourself something to focus on?
Yes, but I just--
Then don't fight it.
If working to free an innocent man helps you
to forget about Mike for a while,
he would be the first person to tell you to do it.
And trust me,
if you really lose yourself in this,
I have a feeling it's gonna seem like a lot less than two years
before he gets out.
Where's Harvey?
Harvey's not here.
Well, get his ass in here
because he made some goddamn side deal
with those traders and I want them out.
Louis, I am telling you, now is not the time.
And I am telling you that I cannot look at
their smug, stupid faces for one more day.
Maybe you don't have to look at them.
What are you talking about?
Louis, did I ever tell you
about my first apartment in the city?
No.
I was sharing a 400 square-foot studio
and it was a disaster until we finally decided
that we had to separate our spaces for privacy.
Well, this isn't "The Brady Bunch," Donna.
We can't put a masking tape line down the center of the office.
I'm not talking about masking tape, Louis.
I am talking about hiring an architect
to reconfigure the offices.
You're right!
We can even do a remodel,
which is what I've been wanting to do for the last five years.
And the best part is, you don't have to deal with
those asshole traders ever again.
Donna, you're a genius.
I know.
Get me the names of six architects before lunch.
Louis, you have your own secretary.
Thanks for nothing.
Why do I even?
Nice of you to show up.
Been peeling these potatoes by myself.
Sorry, I...got caught up.
Speaking of which, how'd it go with your lawyer?
You gettin' out of here?
What?
I'm just kidding. So what's going on?
Nothing.
It's not important.
Your lawyer shows up without you knowing about it
and it's not important?
Come on, do I look like I was born yesterday?
I just said it is not important.
And I'm sorry I left you hanging,
but you wouldn't even have this job without me.
I wouldn't even need this job if it weren't for you.
So what's your problem?
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm...
I'm just not having a good day.
Hey, it's okay.
Don't sweat it. All right?
I mean, it's none of my business anyway.
No, actually, it is your business.
He came here to tell me that he tried to get Gallo transferred,
but...it's not gonna happen.
Well, as long as we stick together,
we can deal with Gallo anyway, right?
Yeah, that's-- that's what I told Harvey.
Right.
Next time you talk to him, tell him I said thanks for trying.
How'd it go?
He said he had to think about it.
What? Why?
'Cause he's an idiot, that's why.
So what're you gonna do?
I'm gonna figure out how to buy us some time.
Well, you better do it fast because Cahill's in your office
and he wants an answer.
Sean.
What'd he say?
Said he wants to see the details in writing.
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.
And I'm not messing around.
Please tell me you're kidding me.
Oh, come on, this is bullshit.
You know my word is good.
Yeah, and I told him that,
and he doesn't want to risk putting a target on his back
and then find out commuting his sentence
really means cutting it in half.
He's not risking anything.
No one's gonna find out.
I'm sure that's exactly what Frank Gallo thought.
So either put it in writing or we don't have a deal.
He didn't go for it, did he?
What are you talking about?
Mike being at risk has nothing to do
with putting anything in writing.
And you told me he wouldn't go for it,
so Harvey... tell me the truth.
All right, he said no.
But Sean, I'm telling you, he'll come around.
He just needs a couple of days.
Do you know how many strings I pulled
to put this thing in motion?
What I know is, you wouldn't have pulled anything
if this case wasn't huge for you.
So instead of yelling at me
for saying that it's gonna take a couple days,
why don't you just give me a couple of days?
Okay, Harvey.
The deal's still on the table.
But if I find a way to move forward without his help,
there is no deal and he does the whole two years.
Jessica.
Harvey.
What's going on with Mike?
I gave him Cahill's offer.
And he's thinking about it?
I'm working on it.
Well, in the meantime, while you were out,
I got a call from Nathan Burns.
He thinks someone's trying to take over his company.
Why the hell would he think of that?
Because word on the street is,
someone's selling off a block of his stock.
That doesn't make sense.
We bought Sutter's shares from him.
Those goddamn traders.
No way.
They wouldn't do that without telling me.
They bought it in good faith.
Well, they're dumping it in bad faith.
I'll take care of it--
No.
You have your hands full with Mike.
I can handle this.
Jessica, it was my idea to involve them.
I should be the one to take care of it.
I don't care whose idea it was, Harvey.
You take care of Mike.
Hello?
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.
Do you accept the charges?
Yes, of course.
Mike, is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.
I was just thinking about you.
I was thinking about you too.
You were?
Yes, in fact, I was just in the middle
of a heated discussion with you
about the best way to handle a death row appeal.
I don't understand.
I took on an Innocence Project case,
just to have something to take my mind off of our troubles.
But I...I didn't want to take my mind off of you.
So I figured I would just imagine we were working on it together.
I don't know what to say.
Say you're in.
I mean, that depends on what strategy we landed on.
Mike, seriously, is there something wrong?
No, I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay.
And that... that we were still good.
Now that I have something to take my mind off our situation
and connect me to you at the same time,
yeah, we're better than good.
All right, can you do me a favor and transfer me to Donna?
Of course. Can I ask why?
I only get one phone call,
and I'm pretty sure she had something to do
with the idea of you imagining us working together,
so I just want to thank her.
Okay. I love you.
I love you too.
Hello?
Donna, I have Mike on the phone.
Put him through.
Hello?
Donna.
If Harvey's there, do me a favor--
keep your voice down, and don't tell him it's me.
Mike, what's going on?
I'm not taking the deal, Donna.
Are you crazy?
It's not that simple.
What's not simple about it? Harvey said that if you--
I don't care what Harvey said.
Because what he didn't say
is that if I do what he wants and someone finds out,
then I may never get back to Rachel at all.
Harvey would never let them find out--
Donna, look, I called you
so that I didn't want to have this argument with him.
Now, I don't have much time.
Are you gonna do this for me or not?
I'll tell him.
Then I also need you to tell him something else for me.
If he comes here to try to change my mind,
I'm not gonna see him.
You mind telling me who the hell said
you can dump Nathan Burns' stock without talking to us?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who's Nathan Burns?
CEO of Exodyne.
Oh, that Nathan Burns.
In that case, I said I could sell that stock
because I own it.
Just like I own this one and this one and this one.
Look at that, my Neubacher Capital position's
going through the roof.
That's not the deal you made with Harvey and you know it.
Welcome to the big, bad world of Wall Street.
Now, do you want something or can I get back to work?
I want something.
You're going to unwind that sale and buy those shares back.
At a premium? Not gonna happen.
I'm your landlord.
And the fact you had to lease to me
means you don't have much of an operation.
You listen to me, you little pissant.
You don't know who you're messing with.
Then why don't I find out?
Over dinner?
You've got to be kidding me.
You want me to have dinner with you
in exchange for backing off that trade?
I think of it as you get to have dinner with me
and I choose to back off that trade
'cause I am a standup guy.
Well, let me let you in on a little something there, Stu.
I don't share dinner staring down the barrel of a shotgun.
So why don't you unwind that trade and then ask me out?
And then we'll see if you're as charming
as you like to think you are.
You know what? I am charming.
But I'm not an idiot.
And I'm not unwinding my trade
without getting something in return.
Harvey, I need to talk to you about something
and you're not going to like it.
About what?
That was Mike on the phone before.
Why didn't you get me?
He's not taking the deal, Harvey.
The hell he isn't.
Where are you going?
To that prison.
Harvey, the reason he called me and not you
is because he knew you wouldn't take no for an answer.
And I'm not going to.
Which is why he said if you show up there,
he's not gonna leave his cell.
Then get me Rachel.
No, no, Harvey, you cannot tell her.
Like hell I can't.
She's the only one who can convince him.
If you tell her that Mike's not taking a deal
that can get him out,
it'll tear her apart.
And if I don't tell her,
he's gonna be in there for two more years.
Is that what she wants?
That's between them.
That's why I want to tell her.
She'll make it between them.
Harvey.
God damn it, he plays checkers with this guy
and thinks he owes him his life.
No, that's not fair and you know it,
because Mike's loyalty is the reason you're not in prison.
That's what's killing me, Donna,
don't you understand?
He's in there instead of me
with a guy I put away,
and I can't just sit here doing nothing
when he has a chance to get out.
Which is why you have to think of something else.
Because if you tell Rachel about this,
the life that's waiting for Mike when he gets out...
it isn't going to be there.
Harvey. I'm surprised to see you here so soon.
I didn't think you'd turn him this fast.
I need more time.
I don't think you understand.
I'm being pressured to move to another investigation.
You've got 24 hours to change his mind or this thing is done.
Then I need you to do something for me.
I am doing something for you.
I'm getting Mike out of prison.
Well, you need to do something else for me
or that's never gonna happen.
What are you talking about?
I need you to get into a room with him
because he won't listen to what I have to say.
What exactly do you want me to tell him
that you haven't already?
Sean, Mike's a bleeding heart.
You need to make the case directly to him.
He needs to see the victims of whatever the hell this guy did.
That's a swell idea, Harvey,
but if I go into that prison and someone sees me,
not only are we dead in the water,
but Mike's life isn't worth shit.
You think I don't know that?
What the hell do you think I'm doing here?
What are you talking about?
I have a plan.
But you're not gonna like it.
Why not?
Because I need you to pull another string,
and I need you to do it before
Frank Gallo tries something else with Mike.
All right, fake lawyer.
Let's see what you got.
You're gonna let me look into it for you?
Look into it? Shit.
You're gonna get me out of here like you promised.
I never promised.
I said there was an excellent chance
that you could get--
Six weeks, brother.
I'll be counting the days.
I'll file the motion first thing in the morning.
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.
And if I find out you're screwing me on any level,
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison,
pray to God I don't find your ass.
What was that all about?
Looks like he took me up on my offer after all.
God damn it, Gretchen, where the hell is she?
Where the hell is who?
That architect you were supposed to call.
She's not supposed to be here for another half hour.
And if I want someone's business,
I show up a half-hour early at the latest.
And what exactly are you looking to have me do
about your little conundrum?
I want you to give her a call
and tell her if she doesn't have the goddamn common courtesy
to show up early,
then she might as well not show up at all.
Mr. Litt.
I--
Y-yes?
I'm Tara Messer.
I'm here to discuss your remodel needs.
My needs?
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Was-Going-to-Be-Our-Architect.
We no longer need your service.
Gretchen, calm down.
You are overreacting like a crazy woman.
You're hired.
I am?
Oh, yeah. You're right for the job.
I can feel it.
You can feel something, all right.
Then why don't we start with
what you're looking for in the space?
Space.
Right, the space. Exactly.
What I'm looking for are clear yet unobtrusive boundaries
between our offices and the tenants'.
But it needs to be elegant and organic
or we might as well not do it at all.
I understand.
Like the perfect aria leading seamlessly
to its inevitable cadenza.
You're an opera lover?
Second only to the ballet.
Then I suggest we start with a marriage.
I mean a tour.
Excuse me, Professor Dunbar.
Do you have a moment?
This is the faculty lounge, Ms. Zane.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I understand that, and I'm sorry.
It's just this is important and you weren't in your office.
What can I do for you?
I met with Leonard Bailey yesterday.
He's the inmate on death--
I know who he is.
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is.
He's rotting on death row for a crime that he didn't commit.
So you met with him for ten minutes
and you're ready to release him?
No, what I'm saying is--
You're a second-year law student, Rachel.
I asked you to be a part of this
because you're one of my brightest students,
but I also asked you in particular
because I didn't think you'd be so naive.
Excuse me?
Your job wasn't to talk to Mr. Bailey once
and, after being moved by his tale of woe,
tell me to jump him to the top of the pile.
It was to assess his case and present evidence.
And that's exactly what I'm doing here.
I just left two boxes of textbook prosecutorial misconduct
with your secretary.
You found all of that since yesterday?
Yes, because while I may only be a second-year law student,
I have been a practicing paralegal for the past eight years.
Looks like I have some reading to do.
I'm sorry for interrupting your day.
Good afternoon, Ms. Zane.
Good afternoon, Professor.
And then we use the glass motif you already have
to partition their space from yours
starting at that wall over there.
And no one ever knows they're two separate entities.
And if we use the frosted glass,
you'll never even have to lay eyes on them.
Well, there's just one more thing.
You want to know
if I can design another bullpen area for your side.
After all, it's the heart and soul of the space.
You get that?
It's my job to get that.
I don't understand.
To me, architecture isn't just about design.
It's--it's about connecting with my clients
on an intimate level.
Well, you're very good at it.
And you know, it's too bad
you already sublet to someone else.
We're looking to expand ourselves.
This space would have been perfect.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
In fact, it's so perfect,
I would have made you an offer on the spot.
Anyway, I'll have some plans drawn up as soon as I can.
We need to get rid of those traders.
Excuse me?
I don't care what kind of deal
you and Harvey cut with them.
We need to get rid of them
and we need to do it now.
Well, Louis, I'm not going to do that
because whoever we replace them with,
this conversation is just going to happen again.
Because we both know that you're out of your mind.
It's not gonna happen again
because in this particular case, I am not out of my mind.
Why do you want me to do this?
Because I'm in love with an architect.
Let me get this straight.
You want me to further antagonize people
that I'm already fighting with
because you don't have the balls
to ask a woman out on a date?
That's one way of looking at it.
No, there's another way.
The answer is no.
Okay, fine.
I'll just stick to the original plan
of having her completely redesign our space,
and I'll just make sure it takes long enough
for her to fall madly in love with me,
and it shouldn't take more than two or three years.
Louis, I want you to look at me when I say this.
If you hire this woman to do anything
relating to this firm's space,
I will personally throw you off the roof this building.
Is that clear?
So you'll think about it?
Get out.
Ahnold.
Come on. Let's see what you got.
I didn't know you played.
Played? Shit.
I set the P.S. 092 single-game scoring record.
P.S. 092 is an elementary school, my friend.
Yeah, sixth grade. I dominated.
Heard you had to file that motion for Gallo's parole.
I did.
Already?
It was an 18-page sentencing amendment.
I could do that in my sleep.
I should get you to do some work for me.
Why? You need some?
No, but if I did, I'd probably get myself a lawyer
who didn't sleep in a prison.
You all right?
I don't--I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
What is it, your stomach?
my God, something's not right.
Take a deep breath.
Put your head down.
God, I can't-- that's not gonna do anything.
I think...
My God, I think somebody
did something to me.
Can I get some help over here?
Guard!
Mike, talk to me.
It's Gallo.
Yeah, he must've put something in my--
Somebody do something! Guard!
Call Harvey.
Guard!
Mike. Mike!
Where is he?
If I knew who you were talking about, maybe I could--
Mike Ross. I need to see him right now.
And who are you?
Harvey Specter. I'm his attorney.
Mr. Ross is in the infirmary,
but you can't see him in there.
Then get me the warden.
I don't appreciate being pushed around, Mr. Specter.
I don't care.
I want everyone to know what happened here today.
They saw what happened.
Yeah, there's a difference between seeing and knowing.
You Kevin Miller?
Who are you?
Harvey Specter.
I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.
Look, I already told the warden
I didn't see anyone touch his food.
Did you see Frank Gallo with him?
Did you or didn't you?
Are you trying to get me killed, man?
Did he touch his food or not?
Yeah, he did, last night at dinner.
But Mike offered to get Gallo parole
and Gallo took him up on it, so why would he poison him?
Because he didn't really take Mike up on that offer.
He just did it to get close to him.
Or he did it to give Mike a taste of what happens
if he doesn't come through.
Either way, you stay the hell away from that son of a bitch.
All right, that's enough. Let's go.
Counselor!
I heard your boy had a little tummy ache out in the yard.
You piece of shit.
You goddamn poisoned him.
Guards, get him out of here.
I didn't do shit.
Why don't you come over here and say that to my face?
You think I won't?
God damn it.
I said get him back to his cell!
This wasn't part of the deal.
We talked about you seeing his roommate,
not rushing Frank Gallo.
Yeah, my guy's lying unconscious in the infirmary.
So sue me.
How did you know Gallo would take the bait?
Because he's an animal, and animals always take the bait.
I'll give you credit for knowing how it would go down.
I don't need credit.
I need to know where Mike Ross is.
Where I was instructed to put him.
Let me tell you something, Mr. Specter,
I don't know you.
So in case you're thinking of trying anything,
that kid has a monitor on his leg,
and if it goes dark for even one second,
I'm gonna make sure that you end up in a cell here with him.
It's not gonna go dark,
and he'll be back here when I said he would.
Then after that, I'm gonna make sure
he gets out of here. For good.
How you feeling?
What's going on?
Where am I?
You're in the back of my car.
You were drugged.
By Gallo.
By me.
What?
Cahill got the warden and the prison doctor
to put something in your food.
They're the only ones who know what's going on.
What the hell are you talking about?
We needed to change your mind about taking this deal,
and we couldn't do it as long as you're in there.
Jesus Christ.
So you drugged me?
We needed a cover for why you're not in your cell,
and this was the only way to do it.
Are you insane?
You broke me out of prison?
I didn't break you out of anywhere.
Cahill sanctioned it.
And if anyone's insane, it's you, 'cause you're the one
turning down a chance to get out of that place.
But we don't have time to talk about that right now.
Cahill's waiting for us.
You got me out to see Cahill?
I said he's waiting.
I didn't say that's where I'm taking you.
Then where the hell are you taking me?
You think me spending a couple of hours with Rachel
is gonna change my mind?
If it doesn't, there's something wrong with you.
So, you gonna yell at me?
Or you gonna take the only chance you're gonna get
to be alone with the woman you love
for the next two years?
Please tell me that you did not tell her
about Cahill's offer.
I wanted to.
But you have Donna to thank for the fact that I didn't.
What am I supposed to tell Rachel about why I'm here?
If it were me, I'd tell her the truth.
Now, since you don't want to do that,
you're lucky I came up with something else.
Wait till it hits 30 and then sell.
Look who it is.
You change your mind about my offer?
I'm not there just yet.
But I did come to apologize.
I didn't mean to be so combative before.
You're a proud woman. I understand. Bygones.
You know, your operation here is kind of impressive.
Mind if I look at one?
You can take a look at anything of mine you want.
Now, what does that line right there mean?
What the hell, that's my Neubacher Capital position.
it seems to be falling very quickly.
Is that a good thing?
You did this.
I'm not sure what you mean.
All I did this afternoon
was call my friend at Jacobson Kearney
and have them issue a press release
about their client's merger negotiations.
I mean, how was I supposed to know that it would make
your Neubacher position fall through the floor?
You used the information I gave you yesterday
about my holdings, that's how.
That's inside information, and I can prove it.
No, it could have been,
if your attorney hadn't filed your position with the SEC
ten days earlier than he had to.
I'm not gonna forget this.
Good, because my operation's been around
a hell of a lot longer than yours,
and we can be friends or we can be enemies.
But you mess with me again
and I'll not only kick you out of these offices,
I'll put you in the ground.
Rachel.
How?
Harvey.
I don't understand.
I know you know about Frank Gallo.
But what you don't know
is that they put me in solitary confinement for 36 hours.
Oh my God.
It's okay.
I was safe.
Then Harvey made them watch the video,
which showed that I was only defending myself.
Turns out they were more than happy to trade
six hours and an ankle bracelet to avoid a lawsuit.
We only have six hours?
Yeah, and I don't want to waste any of it.
Mr. Litt, what are you--
Please, call me Louis.
What can I do for you, Louis?
Tara, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
We're not gonna be moving forward
with the renovations after all.
I'm sorry to hear that.
No, it has nothing to do with you.
And of course I will pay you out of my own pocket
for any of the work you've already done.
That won't be necessary.
Please, Tara, I insist.
In that case, I might as well at least
show you what I had in mind.
As you can see, these are just rough drawings.
Not to me.
Here's the frosted glass wall curving in an elegant "S"
that separates the space.
It's beautiful.
That's not even the best part.
Because I know how important the new bullpen is to you,
I modeled it after the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia,
and I enclosed the entire space--
In mahogany.
It would have been exquisite.
But some things weren't meant to be.
Yeah.
How would you feel about renovating my summer house
in the Hamptons?
I appreciate the thought,
Louis, but I don't do residential work.
It's not residential. I use it as a home office.
But it would be so small.
No, I want the entire house to be
a satellite division of the firm.
Are you sure?
I've never been as sure of anything in my entire life.
Then I look forward to working with you, Louis.
Sean, what can I do for you?
Where the hell are they?
What?
I've been sitting in my office
for two hours waiting for them.
Where the hell are they?
I don't know. Maybe they're caught in traffic.
Listen to me, I can contact the prison
and find out exactly where they are.
But I do that, it starts a tornado of shit
with your boss in the eye of the storm.
So you're gonna tell me right now
what the hell they're up to.
He's waiting for Mike outside of his apartment.
Waiting for him to do what?
He's with Rachel.
You got to be kidding me.
I didn't pull in every favor I have so Mike Ross
could have some conjugal visit.
No, you pulled in every favor you had
so that Harvey could convince Mike to do what you wanted
and this is gonna make that happen.
By getting him laid?
By reminding him of what he's missing out on
if he doesn't take your deal.
That wasn't the plan.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go down there and do
what we said we were gonna do.
I'm gonna show Mike the innocent people
that lost everything because of that bastard.
Sean, please, if you do that,
Rachel will find out about everything
and that can't happen.
Why not?
Because Mike chose prison over her once,
and if he does it again, she'll never forgive him.
Mike's problem. Not mine.
No, that's Harvey's problem.
He promised Mike he wouldn't tell her,
and Harvey's a man of his word.
If he were a man of his word, he would be here right now.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna do what should've been done
in the first place.
I'm gonna tell Mike's fiancée
that he has a chance to get out
but he doesn't want to take it.
You want to tell me what that was all about?
Harvey and Cahill got Mike out of prison
to convince him to take the deal,
and Harvey brought Mike to Rachel instead of to Sean.
He broke Mike out of prison?
Is he crazy?
It sounded crazy to me at first too,
but Harvey's living with the guilt of putting Mike in there
and Cahill was willing to do it, so can you blame him?
No. I can't.
But I want to know how this whole thing shakes out.
And I want to know tonight.
What time is it?
We still have time.
My God.
I fell asleep.
You did.
Why didn't you wake me?
Because you looked so peaceful.
Rachel, I don't want us to waste--
We're not wasting anything.
Mike, I don't know how well you sleep in there,
so to be able to give you this...
Thank you.
Can I cook you something?
I'll make you anything you want.
No, I just want us to lie here and stare at each other.
Not say anything.
God.
You're so beautiful.
I thought you wanted us to be quiet.
Couldn't help it.
You know, you always tell me how beautiful I am.
You never give me a chance to tell you how handsome
I think you are.
I thought you loved me for my mind.
I do.
But that doesn't mean
that I don't also think you're handsome.
Mike, what's going on?
There's something I need to tell you.
Does it have something to do with why you're really here?
Because I didn't believe what you told me earlier.
Why didn't you say something?
Because you're here, so I didn't care.
What's that?
I'm unwinding my position with Nathan Burns' company.
I appreciate that.
But I don't need to take home the paper trail.
It's not a paper trail.
It's an engagement letter.
Turns out my attorney was filing my positions
before he had to,
so I let him go.
You want me to take you as a client.
If you'll have me.
On one condition.
I hear you've been having fun with Louis Litt.
But it stops now.
Done.
I should have known the guy who hired a fraud like that
would pull a stunt like this.
This stunt is gonna get youexactly what you want.
No, Harvey.
I'm gonna get what I want
by telling that kid's fiancée the truth
and letting her do the work for me.
Listen to me, Sean.
She doesn't know
because he doesn't want her to know.
I don't give a shit what he wants.
Then trust me, this is the only way
to get what you want.
Trust you? You lied to my face.
I made a judgment call.
Then look me in the eye
and tell me you didn't make that call
before you asked me to get him out.
I knew it.
The whole time you were always gonna bring him here.
Because this is the way to get it done.
Then why didn't you tell me that in the first place?
Because it would have ended up
with you wanting to use Rachel.
It ended there anyway. Now get the hell out of my way.
Don't make me stop you, Sean.
Are you threatening a federal prosecutor, Harvey?
You're goddamn right I am.
Well, you better think about this move
more than you thought about the last one.
'Cause it's not gonnaend well for you.
Far as I'm concerned,
it's the same move.
I made a promise and I'm not gonna break it.
Harvey!
Whatever you're fighting about, you can stop.
I told Rachel everything.
I'm taking the deal.
Then let's get in the car and get moving.
*Oh kiss me one more time*
*Oh kiss me one more time*
*Before the sun goes down*
*Before the sun goes down*
*And all the creatures of the night*
*And all the creatures of the night*
*Crawling over this town*
*Crawling over this town*
*I'm lost in the city*
*The city of angels*
*Down in the valley*
