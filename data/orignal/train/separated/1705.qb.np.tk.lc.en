it &apos;s from game of thrones .
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we &apos;re going to start a fantasy sword collection--
and i &apos;ve long thought we should--
is this really the sword to start with ?
what did you have in mind ?
well , off the top of my head , i &apos;d have to go with excalibur .
it gives you the right to rule england .
it would be a replica of a movie prop .
fair enough .
it &apos;d give you the right to rule a replica of england .
well , they don &apos;t have an excalibur here ,
so what do you want to do ?
mm . tough decision .
there &apos;s no weaponry from lord of the rings
forged in a chinese sweatshop ?
just bilbo baggins &apos; sword over there .
two grown men with a hobbit &apos;s dagger ; wouldn &apos;t we look silly ?
okay , let &apos;s go for it .
oh , i see you guys have found my little treasure .
yeah .
it &apos;s okay , i guess .
okay ? it &apos;s magnificent .
what do you want for it ?
oh , it &apos;s hard to put a price on something
that &apos;s a copy of something that was on pay cable .
but for my friends , let &apos;s say 250 ?
oh , that &apos;s pretty steep .
well , it &apos;s a limited edition .
they only made 8,000 of these bad boys .
only 8,000 ?
we &apos;re wasting precious time . buy it .
hang on .
can you do any better ?
are you kidding ?
i &apos;m already giving you the friends and family discount .
oh , did you hear that ?
we &apos;re getting the friends and family discount .
we are honored and we will take it .
slow down .
two hundred .
what are you doing ?
250 is already the discounted price .
will you shut up ?
tell you what , i &apos;ll go 235 .
nope . maybe another time .
okay , 225-- my final offer .
take it , take it .
two hundred .
man , you &apos;re killing me !
killing you ? i can &apos;t breathe .
210 , and i &apos;m losing money .
oh , now , we can &apos;t let him lose money , leonard . i &apos;m so sorry .
210 and you throw in the iron man helmet .
are you crazy ?
that helmet &apos;s signed by robert downey jr .
so ?
okay , if you &apos;re going to question
the importance of an actor &apos;s signature on a plastic helmet
from a movie based on a comic book ,
then all of our lives have no meaning !
okay , fine .
just the sword , 210 .
thank you .
i can eat meat this week .
see that ?
i just saved us 40 bucks .
i &apos;ve long said , what you lack in academic knowledge
you make up for in street smarts .
you want me to wrap it ?
no , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna stab my friend in the chest .
hey , stuart .
ah , hey , wil .
hello , wil wheaton .
hi , sheldon .
nice sword .
it &apos;s part of my sword collection .
do you have a sword collection ?
no .
i &apos;m not surprised .
here &apos;s the batman 612
with the jim lee alternate cover that you wanted .
awesome . what do i owe you ?
40 bucks .
good deal .
sucker .
didn &apos;t even ask for the friends and family discount .
hey , i &apos;m having a party at my house on friday ,
and i was hoping you would stop by .
will there be girls there ?
yeah , of course .
&apos;cause there wasn &apos;t last time .
there will be girls .
you guys are invited if you want to come by .
thank you .
all right , great .
later .
i see what you &apos;re doing .
you accept an invitation
to a party at the home of my sworn enemy ,
he tells everyone we &apos;re going to be there ,
and when we don &apos;t show , he looks the fool .
fiendishly clever .
i was actually thinking about going .
and then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out ,
leaving him humiliated in front of his guests .
love it .
no , i was gonna grab raj and howard
and have a good time .
oh , great , more guys .
it &apos;s gonna be another wil wheaton sausage @-@ fest .
sheldon , can you grab me a water ?
possibly .
can you or can &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s not that simple , leonard .
it never is , is it ?
at this moment , our relationship exists
in two mutually contradictory states .
until you either do not go or go
to wil wheaton &apos;s party ,
you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend .
i &apos;m characterizing this phenomenon
as schrodinger &apos;s friendship .
got it . can i have my water ?
of course .
now get it yourself , you traitor .
wait , what is going on ?
in case you have forgotten ,
schrodinger &apos;s cat is a thought experiment ...
no , no , i didn &apos;t forget .
um , there &apos;s this cat in a box and until you open it ,
it &apos;s either dead or alive or both .
although , back in nebraska ,
our cat got stuck in my brother &apos;s camp trunk ,
and we did not need to open it
to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there .
homespun stories , knowledge of physics
and a bosom that defies it .
you &apos;re the whole package , aren &apos;t you ?
sorry i &apos;m late .
uh , i got great news .
nasa picked my team &apos;s design
for the deep field space telescope
that &apos;s going on the international space station this spring .
howie , that &apos;s wonderful !
congratulations !
it gets better .
someone has to go up with the telescope
as a payload specialist ,
and guess who that someone is .
muhammad li .
who &apos;s muhammad li ?
muhammad is the most common first name in the world ,
li , the most common surname .
as i didn &apos;t know the answer ,
i thought that gave me a mathematical edge .
it &apos;s me , sheldon .
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m going up in space !
technically , i &apos;m an astronaut .
that &apos;s amazing !
hang on a second .
nasa doesn &apos;t have a shuttle anymore .
how are you going to get up there ?
oh , well , it &apos;s really cool .
you fly to moscow , they take you out to kazakhstan ,
and then you get into a russian soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit .
or just sits there on the launch pad
because the kazakhi mafia
sold the rocket fuel on the black market .
are those russian rockets safe ?
well , i mean , safe as it can be when it was built
by the good folks who brought you chernobyl .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
the dream to go up into space is one we all share ,
and howard &apos;s making that a reality .
we &apos;re all very proud of you .
cheers .
that was a lovely toast .
kudos .
thank you .
simultaneously , a festival of cloying cliche .
you sicken me .
you &apos;re really quiet .
is everything okay ?
fine .
just a little tired .
i hope not too tired , because i &apos;m feeling
particularly masculine right now .
all systems go , if you catch my drift .
i always catch your drift .
all right , well , something &apos;s obviously bugging you .
what is it ?
i just can &apos;t believe you signed up
for the space program without even talking to me .
oh , i get it .
you &apos;re worried about me .
that is so sweet .
you know , there &apos;s a saying we have at nasa .
what makes the right stuff so right
is that it always comes home .
just stop talking , howard .
this isn &apos;t the reaction i expected
when i told you i was gonna be an astronaut .
what did you think was going to happen ?
honestly ? sex .
howard .
do you realize what a big deal this is ?
what an honor it is to be chosen to go into space ?
yeah , i get it .
i just wish you included me in the decision .
we &apos;re supposed to be partners .
we &apos;re supposed to be a team .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
okay , let &apos;s try this again .
bernadette , an opportunity has come up
that impacts both of us , and i &apos;d like to discuss it .
okay .
i &apos;ve been offered a chance to go up
to the international space station for three weeks .
what are your thoughts on that ?
well , first of all , thank you
for including me in the decision @-@ making process .
hey , we &apos;re a team .
so , what do you think ?
no .
no ?
no .
why not ?
howard , my father was a police officer .
we never knew from one night to the next
if he was going to come home alive .
it was horrible .
and i don &apos;t want to live that way with you .
hey , my father abandoned me and my mother
when i was 11 .
we never saw him again .
oh , boo @-@ hoo , you &apos;re not going to space !
pretty cool about howard , huh ?
don &apos;t talk to me as if nothing &apos;s happened between us .
and yes , it sure is , buddy .
for god &apos;s sake , will you stop with the schrodinger stuff .
would you prefer a simpler application
of heisenberg &apos;s uncertainty principle ,
in which i could either
know where you are or whether i like you ,
but not both .
you never stop talking , do you ?
i don &apos;t understand .
what differences does it make
if leonard goes to wil wheaton &apos;s party ?
wil wheaton is sheldon &apos;s mortal enemy .
mortal enemy ?
sheldon , i know you &apos;re a bit
of a left @-@ handed monkey wrench , but ...
you really have a mortal enemy ?
in fact , i have 61 of them .
would you like to see the list ?
oh , say no , say no , say no , say no .
you just got off the list .
would you like back on it ?
this &apos;ll just take a moment .
it &apos;s on a five and a quarter inch floppy .
a floppy disk ?
well , i started the list when i was nine .
how did wil wheaton get on the list ?
oh , god !
oh ! come on !
as a child , i loved wesley crusher ,
wil wheaton &apos;s character on &lt; i &gt; star trek . &lt; / i &gt;
so , i drove for hours by bus to a &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; convention
at which wil wheaton was scheduled to appear ,
so that i could get my wesley crusher action figure signed .
but he never showed , because
apparently , it was cooler for him
to be the lower @-@ left corner on &lt; i &gt; hollywood squares . &lt; / i &gt;
oh , damn !
the floppy failed .
well , whoever was in charge of quality control
at the verbatim corporation in 1989,
congratulations , you just made the list .
howard ?
change your mind about sex ?
i &apos;m still mad , but i &apos;ll do it .
no , i &apos;ve just been thinking .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m afraid for your safety .
i don &apos;t want to be the person
who stands between you and your dreams .
really ?
really .
if going into space means that much to you ,
i will never say another word about it .
thank you .
i love you .
i love you , too .
so , sex now ?
okay .
i just forgot to brush my teeth .
i &apos;ll be right back .
* oh , baby
* i &apos;m
* i &apos;m not in love with you ...
over my dead body my son goes into outer space !
i &apos;m ready .
wait , let me see if i got this right .
you actually asked bernadette
to leave your house in the middle of the night ?
what choice did i have ?
she went behind my back
and turned my own mother against me .
wow . you &apos;re not only our first astronaut .
you &apos;re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed .
you &apos;re like a rock star .
little bit .
i hate to say it , but she did kind of betray you .
interesting .
you see betrayal in others , but not yourself .
going to wheaton &apos;s party is not betraying you .
oh , of course you would have to believe that .
evil always thinks it &apos;s doing right .
&quot; excuse me , stormtrooper . &quot;
&quot; these are the droids you &apos;re looking for . &quot;
i &apos;m going to a party .
i &apos;m not turning r2 @-@ d2 and c @-@ 3po over to the empire !
not yet .
so , what &apos;s gonna happen next ?
are you and bernadette going to break up ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we &apos;re going to get back together ,
she &apos;s going to have to apologize and accept that
i &apos;m a grown man who can make his own decisions .
then she &apos;s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space .
obviously .
i had no choice .
i had to tell his mother .
he can &apos;t go to space .
he &apos;s like a baby bird .
do you know he once got an asthma attack
from reading an old library book ?
you &apos;re kidding .
no , i was there that day .
sheldon threw his back out handing him that book .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do .
i don &apos;t want to break up over this .
okay , why don &apos;t you just tell him you made a mistake ?
do you guys think it was a mistake ?
am i the bad guy in this ?
it &apos;s not for us to judge .
we &apos;re just here to provide comfort and support
while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you &apos;ve done .
oh , god , you &apos;re right .
i took our love and threw it under his bus @-@ sized mother .
i need to apologize .
well , that @-@ that &apos;s good . i &apos;m glad you came to that .
but before you do , let me just ask you a big picture question .
what ?
are you 100 % positive
you love and want to marry howard wolowitz ?
i do , with all my heart .
got it . just had to check .
he &apos;s great .
all right , sheldon .
we &apos;re going to wil &apos;s .
this is your last chance .
no , leonard , this is &lt; i &gt; your &lt; / i &gt; last chance .
one day ,
a historian is going to come to you and say ,
&quot; is it true you were friends with dr. sheldon cooper ? &quot;
and you &apos;re going to have to
choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation
as you mumble , &quot; i was , but
i chose to go to a party
thrown by the one kid from stand by me that no one remembers . &quot;
you want to drive ?
sure .
hey , sheldon ?
oh , good .
you picked me , you picked me .
no , i just got a text from stuart .
brent spiner is at the party .
brent spiner ?
yes .
i don &apos;t care .
really ?
brent spiner ,
mr. data himself . you love him .
i did , but i think i &apos;ve kind of outgrown &lt; i &gt; star trek . &lt; / i &gt;
you know , stock characters ,
ludicrous plots , &quot; beam me up . &quot;
what a load of hooey .
i &apos;m going .
live long and prosper , sheldon .
yeah , even that . you look like a dork .
howard , bernadette &apos;s here !
tell her i &apos;m not home !
what kind of a schmuck play is that ? !
she can hear you shouting !
can we talk ?
you can . i have nothing to say .
all right .
i just wanted to tell you
i &apos;m sorry i said something to your mother .
i was gonna tell her eventually ,
but you went behind my back .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i got scared .
if you &apos;re gonna love me ,
you &apos;re gonna have to love the whole package :
the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil .
i know .
well , don &apos;t say it if you &apos;re not gonna mean it ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not just gonna stop with the space station .
yeah , i want to go to the moon , i want to go to mars .
i want to take a one @-@ man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean .
really ?
you got seasick on pirates of the caribbean .
well , those big kids were rocking it .
i just did what i did because i love you so much ,
and the thought of losing you is more than i can handle .
really ?
you &apos;re my soul mate .
this is where you kiss me .
right , right .
make up all you want !
your tuchis is not leaving this planet !
hey , you know that beautiful actress who plays
the borg queen in &lt; i &gt; first contact &lt; / i &gt; ?
yeah .
well , i just met her gynecologist !
what are you doing here ?
fighting for our friendship .
as peculiar and annoying as you can be ,
you &apos;re still my little buddy .
i &apos;m not going to let that end here tonight .
now put down that drink , let &apos;s meet brent spiner and go home .
hey , sheldon , i &apos;m so glad you made it .
i found something i think you might like .
what i &apos;d like is for him to have a more depressing home .
this is quite lovely .
this is for you .
an original mint @-@ in @-@ package wesley crusher action figure .
i remembered your story about the time you went
to a convention when you were a kid
to get one signed , and i didn &apos;t show up .
look at what i wrote .
&quot; to sheldon , sorry this took so long .
your friend , wil wheaton . &quot;
it &apos;s my last one .
i want you to have it .
look , everyone . wil wheaton is my friend !
i haven &apos;t seen one of these in years .
remember how we used to make these things look
like they were masturbating ?
brent spiner , what have you done ? !
that was an original mint @-@ in @-@ package
wesley crusher action figure
signed by my close personal friend , wil wheaton .
sorry , slim .
i &apos;ve got some mr. data dolls in the trunk of my car .
you want me to sign one for you ?
you &apos;ve already signed something , brent spiner .
your name on my list .
from this moment on , you are my mortal enemy .
don &apos;t worry . it doesn &apos;t take up a whole lot of your time .
come on , buddy .
let &apos;s not waste another second on this loser .
love your house .
