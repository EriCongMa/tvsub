玛雅文明最发达时期
第二十四季第二集
according to our mayan calendar ,
the world will be destroyed
at the end of the 13th baktun .
unless we appease the gods &apos; anger with a human sacrifice .
don &apos;t worry . we got a guy here we really been fattening up .
is it you ?
not me . that guy .
more cricket fajitas !
oh , my brave , brave glutton .
i &apos;ll be so lonely when they sacrifice you to the gods .
what ? !
no one said anything about a sacrifice !
although i ... i did kind of space out during orientation .
all right already , let &apos;s get this done
while our doomed civilization is still flourishing here .
oh . any words of comfort ?
oh , yeah , sure . even though you know it &apos;s coming ,
when you see your own beating heart ,
try to act surprised , huh ?
it &apos;s some kid &apos;s first time .
fear not , my beloved blood offering .
i have a plan .
tell me , high priest ,
are you interested in women ?
what priest isn &apos;t ?
before we make love ,
would you mind putting a sack over your head ?
is there any other way ?
nice and tight .
now enter the room of pleasure , ooh .
and i shall join you shortly .
now , uh , i got to warn you . i &apos;m into rough stuff .
ooh , that &apos;s a good start , but , you know , make it hurt .
that whooshing sound is really turning me ...
uh . oh , yeah . ah .
man , soccer &apos;s even boring for the ball .
quetzal h. coatl !
we sacrificed the wrong person !
now the earth will be destroyed after the 13th baktun .
can you explain that in simple ancient mayan ? !
of course . there &apos;s no need to shout and scream .
let &apos;s see , uh ,
converting to base 10,
assuming for the birth of jesus ,
invent and then carry the leap year ,
and the world will end in 2012 !
and it will be obama &apos;s fault !
hey , uh , marge , i &apos;m setting my watch .
what baktun is it ?
13th !
oh ! what have we here ?
what the hell !
welcome to the grand opening of our whatchamacallit ,
which , thanks to the lobbying of lisa simpson ,
we built instead of a new baseball stadium .
at least the pennant works both ways .
professor frink will now throw a switch , which will either
answer certain obscure questions of subatomic physics
or destroy the universe .
oh , my god particle !
what is it , professor ?
you can tell your grandchildren you were here
when humanity finally learned that this accelerator
is much too small to tell us anything important .
thanks a lot , liser !
that money could &apos;ve been used for a war !
aah ! no one takes willie &apos;s mop !
take the mop ! take the mop !
a mini black hole !
oh , no ! i got to take it away
before more clueless kids fall into it .
geronimo ... !
i &apos;s rich !
i &apos;s poor and shack @-@ less .
lisa , do you
have a stray dog down there ?
um , it &apos;s a lot worse than a stray dog .
two stray dogs ? !
it &apos;s a black hole !
that was gonna be my next guess .
are you sure your next guess wasn &apos;t
three stray dogs ?
maybe .
a black hole ? !
i &apos;m sorry , can we call it that ?
yes . it &apos;s the preferred term .
and most scientists believe that what enters a black hole
never comes out .
but some think they may be a gateway to other universes .
hey ! could it open a pretzel bag for me ?
help a brother out , b.h.
guys ! stop throwing things in the hole !
the more you throw in , the bigger
and more dangerous it becomes !
come on . you can &apos;t look at that infinitely dense little guy
and not want to feed it something .
dad , don &apos;t pat it !
why shouldn &apos;t ...
why you little ...
i &apos;m nature &apos;s perfect choking machine !
okay , that &apos;s it !
i &apos;m putting a baby gate across the black hole .
and don &apos;t throw anything more into it !
yes , homer ?
dad , that &apos;s creepy .
sorry .
i know we shouldn &apos;t feed this ,
but grease brings raccoons .
quit bageling my english muffins !
the black hole is looking a lot bigger .
does anybody want to admit to throwing things in ?
no .
not me .
do we even still have that thing ?
and i have to ask , has anyone seen the cat ?
now what ?
okay , it &apos;s possible someone may have started a business
called magic craphole waste removal ,
but it wasn &apos;t me .
《 黑洞 》
stop !
this is a black hole , not a lawn @-@ and @-@ leaf bag !
if one more thing gets in there , it could reach critical mass .
i did it !
i hit my first home run !
no ... !
i &apos;m still proud of you , buddy .
and look ! i got money to take you for pizza !
you saw that i had the money , right ?
welcome , trans- dimensional visitors .
we have received your many gifts with gratitude .
we have built our society around the treasures you have sent .
our most popular magazine is
your presidents &apos; day mattress blowout insert .
our favorite food is your banana peel .
and we listen to all our music
on the most wonderful device ever created ,
the zune .
zune , zune , zune .
treasures ? gifts ? you &apos;ve got it all wrong .
that stuff is just our old ...
wonderful stuff . enjoy it .
zune .
day 1
we bought this camera because strange things
have been going on at our house in the dead of night .
and if anyone finds this footage after we &apos;re all missing or dead ,
remember me as a hero .
dad ,
you forgot to pick me up after little league .
you tossed your car keys in my bean plant .
a hero !
homer , is that my camera ?
hero , away !
night 1 .
want to snuggle ?
not with the camera on .
uh , i turned it off .
looks like the red light &apos;s on .
i swear i am not filming !
note to self-- edit out my lies .
wait ! don &apos;t kill the monster without me !
i &apos;m right behind you , honey ! we have stairs ?
what the ... ?
what the ... ?
why is this happening to us ? !
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know ! i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t know !
oh , sweetie .
sometimes a mysterious , invisible being from hell
waits for a family to go to sleep then kills them .
now , go to bed .
but ...
uh @-@ uh . school night .
now , you &apos;re sure i bought enough cameras
and extended warranties to catch that ghost ?
sir , whatever happens in this house ,
these cameras will pick it up .
ooh , i can &apos;t wait for tonight &apos;s massacre .
hey , marge .
like what you see , huh ?
i like it when you don &apos;t say words .
come here , you . mmm ...
yeah , that &apos;s hellfire , all right .
someone in this family has made a deal with the devil ,
and now the devil wants his due .
now , remember , this creature feeds on your fear ...
what the hell was that ? !
actually , he feeds on more than just fear .
give back my baby !
we had a deal !
mom , what &apos;s going on ? !
don &apos;t act so surprised , marge .
you knew this day was coming !
let &apos;s see what we &apos;re dealing with here .
it &apos;s moe with wings !
moe szyslak ?
come on , he &apos;s much more hideous and evil than me !
i brought this on us all .
it began when i was a girl ...
hail satan .
what are you doing ?
trying to summon the devil .
why ?
nothing good on tv .
we have no boyfriends .
we &apos;re bored .
something to do .
hail satan , the minister of sinister ,
rude dude with a bad &apos; tude .
save us , marge .
we &apos;ll never make fun of any man you date or marry .
mmm . uh , mr. demon ? mmm ?
could you ... come back for my sisters later ?
very well . you have 30 years .
but when i return , marge ,
i shall take your favorite child .
i thought i was the favorite !
not the favorite ! not the favorite !
listen , pal , you seem like an honest guy .
is there any other deal that you can accept ?
three @-@ way .
hmm . you , me and marge ?
mmm , demon , demon , you .
i guess it &apos;s one of those things a dad has to do .
now , before we start , what &apos;s the safe word ?
cinnamon .
i like that .
now , i &apos;d like to try something new , if you don &apos;t mind .
cinnamon . cinnamon . cinnamon !
you know , it &apos;s really not fair .
you &apos;re charging 200 bucks for a comic
that says 25 cents on the cover .
the only way to buy that comic book for 25 cents
is to go back to 1974 .
that &apos;s impossible !
or is it ?
回到1974年的男孩
wow , it worked !
my time machine has worked !
this is the most fantastically powerful invention
in mankind &apos;s history !
here , kid , hold my keys
while i grab some lunch .
1974 !
i won &apos;t be needing this !
now to get my comic book and explore a world
where no one &apos;s mad at george lucas .

might be a hell of a lot better !
ma &apos;am , whatever you do , do not marry that ape .
b 从此使劲哭去吧
whatever you say , little boy .

i &apos;ve met some jive turkeys in the &apos; 70s ,
but that turkey &apos;s the jivest .
hey , you ! this is my peeping tree .
young me ? what brings you to the present ?
i traveled through space and time to make marge settle for me
because she doesn &apos;t know better .
well , if we put our heads together ,
we could think of a plan !
i got to ask , what happened ?
was i in a forest fire or something ?
no .
i love my life , i love it not .
i love my life , i love it not .
you &apos;re just like indiana jones , son .
a role played by richard dreyfuss in our universe .
i &apos;m here to take my life back !
i thought this might happen ,
so i mastered brazilian jujitsu .
crawl atop me , and meet your doom !
not so fast .
say hello to the united federation
of homers through history .
crush them ...
in the name of jebus !
okay , guys , let &apos;s regroup .
we &apos;ll come back with more homers
and start fresh in the morning .

i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m realizing that i married the wrong man .
oh , you poor , sweet , simple homers .
i was supposed to be with all of you !
even you , caveman homer .
that &apos;s renaissance homer .

i wish that 20 years ago , i had chosen love .
