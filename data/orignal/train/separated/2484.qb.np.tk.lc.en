转基因食品 有益还是超级灾难

forget you !
one of our brightest and most meddlesome students
called this meeting-- somehow--
to discuss an urgent menu matter . lisa ?
our school cafeteria is serving gmos--
genetically modified organisms .
now , in order to thoroughly explore the issue ,
i &apos;d like to play the first video that came up in my web browser
when i typed in &quot; gmo &quot; plus &quot; danger &quot;
plus &quot; question mark . &quot;
hear , hear !

if there &apos;s one thing scientists love , it &apos;s money .
money , money , money .
and that &apos;s been true of scientists
ever since caveman times .
we need look no further back than the ancient mayans ,
who crossbred plants and animals
in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort
that charges $ 30 a night to valet park .
once you &apos;re there , they &apos;ve gotcha .
the mayans didn &apos;t listen ... to themselves .
yet today , we toy with our fate
by using retroviruses to create these so @-@ called &quot; super foods . &quot;
are we doomed to repeat an event
that destroyed all human life ?
the answer is in your mouth !
um , that video seemed a little unscientific .
my name is jenny mccarthy , and i endorse this tirade .
oh , my god , it &apos;s worse than i thought .
everybody wait here while i do some actual research .
nobody form any opinions while i &apos;m gone .
well , hurry , we have no minds of our own .
i say we do not categorically ban
genetically modified organisms .
what ? !
well , gmos are resistant to pests ,
disease and drought .
it &apos;s just possible that gmos
can actually end world hunger .
i say , let &apos;s get these gmos inside our children pronto !
way ahead of you !

i &apos;m eating the food of the future .
what is love ?
lisa , i &apos;d like to thank you
for mollifying these land apes .
we &apos;d like you and your family to visit us
at the monsarno research campus .
ooh , campus ! do you have a statue of the founder
i can stick a funny hat on ?
go , go , go !
simpsons , we &apos;re trying
to change the world one molecule at a time .
sounds like that would take a while .
ooh , you &apos;re right .
everyone , three molecules at a time .
oh , you got to be kidding me !
i &apos;ll be home late , honey .
yeah . three molecules now .
well , it &apos;s nice to see for once
a corporation that does good work and cares about people .
yes , lisa , we finally put to bed the silly notion
that our company is in any way evil .
now , say hello to our chief scientist .
鲍勃 · 特维力格
sideshow bob !
dr. sideshow bob .
real doctor or phd ?
phd .
all right , i &apos;ll leave you and bob
in this locked room to get reacquainted .
simpsons ,
there &apos;s no need for alarm .
that &apos;s not for you to suck !
now ... where was i ?
right . uh , no need to worry .
i &apos;m still technically shawshanking it
at springfield penitentiary .
this is getting boring .
either murder us or tell us how you got here .
very well .
the inanity of the vanity license plate puns
was slowly driving me mad .
so when monsarno labs asked for experimental subjects ,
i ... gladly volunteered .
my job was to make sure the experiments
wouldn &apos;t be too painful for the test monkeys .
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing here .
uh , we &apos;ll pick it up after lunch .
i wrote up my results and went from subject ...
to scientist .
look at me !
i &apos;m sideshow bob !
sideshow bob !
foolish boy ! that &apos;s phosphoric acid !
a mere sip would have dissolved
a hole in your stomach the size of a silver dollar .
yakety , yakety , yak .
&quot; the spotted hawk accuses me ,
he complains of my gab . &quot;
&quot; i too am not a bit tamed ,
i too am untranslatable . &quot;
walt whitman . leaves of grass .
very good . lisa , you always were
the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool
that is the simpsons .
that &apos;s mean .
if you &apos;re done ,
our chief scientist has to get back to work .
our corn on the cob has become self @-@ aware .
wait ! wait ! won &apos;t you visit me again ?
let me show you
i really am trying to make a better world .
lisa , we can talk walt whitman .
and , homer , i think you &apos;d enjoy the company
of the campus &apos; lazy , overfed squirrels .
&quot; overfed &quot; ? i don &apos;t know this word .
visit me , lisa . we can discuss poetry ,
fine art , and ... and if we must , jazz .
mom , can i visit sideshow bob ?
why would you want to do that ?
he &apos;s tried to kill us !
you . he tried to kill you .
and i refuse to concede a mind
that thinks so much like mine can be all bad .
don &apos;t you think the parts that aren &apos;t evil are a little , mm ...
pretentious ?
absolutely . we &apos;re talking about lisa , right ?
shut up !
you shut up !
this is the pinnacle of conversation around here !
fine , i &apos;ll take you .
they have this cool psych class
at the campus i sat in on .
uh , that was a sexual harassment seminar .
it doesn &apos;t matter-- i &apos;m taking it pass @-@ fail .
blowing off steam in the crafts room , marge ?
no ! i &apos;m not giving up on reaching those kids ,
and i might just have a secret weapon .
is it finger puppets ?
maybe !
well , we haven &apos;t had finger puppets in this church
since reverend brogan was arrested .
but i suppose enough time has passed .
and that &apos;s why nancy no
is the most popular girl in promiseville high .
mm . i prefer the modern thinking of yolanda yes .
and i think i &apos;d have a shot with mabel maybe .
i &apos;m so tired of those kids sniggering .
it &apos;s horndog hank .
well , nancy knows how to keep him away .
darn it , they &apos;re stuck .
um , can i take one of those girl puppets home ?
i won &apos;t do nothin &apos; to it .
* you say modified tomato *
* i say modified tomahto *
* i say engineered potato , you say engineered potahto *
* potato ! potahto *
* tomato ! tomahto *
* let &apos;s splice some dna *
that is my first non @-@ evil laugh in years .
bob , there &apos;s one thing i got to know .
are you plotting revenge ?
i don &apos;t plot revenge anymore .
it &apos;s like love . if it happens , it happens .
now , how about those mores ?
dad ! you already ate all the chocolate bars .
that &apos;s why i got to get the marshmallows down fast .
i like how they cut them down
from 140 characters
to a more manageable 20 characters .
oh , another seminar tomorrow .
i just wish i could connect with those teenagers ,
since it seems like we &apos;ll never have any .
oh , marge ,
teens can &apos;t control their urges .
it &apos;s why there &apos;s never been a teenage president .
are you saying i &apos;m wasting my time ?
no . i &apos;m saying you &apos;re wasting everyone &apos;s time .
but it &apos;s a church thing , so that &apos;s a given .
oh . well , then maybe
i need to give those kids a better example .
good night !
shut your eyes . they &apos;re too bright .
sorry .
kids , today , we have a very special guest--
my husband .
i brought homer here
to show that we can ,
and have , abstained for two whole days .
two days ? that &apos;s all ?
that means , three days ago , the two of you
made the blob with two backs !
listen , you punks ,
if you can &apos;t handle the image of our naked bodies
in the tender act of a @-@ oo @-@ ga ,
you should never have come to the basement of this holy place .
ugh ! he &apos;s touching her !
they &apos;re practically doin &apos; it here !
i &apos;ll sign the pledge !
just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head !
never !
all right , bob , you &apos;ve created 5,000 patents ,
so ... one hour of freedom .
but remember , your every move will be watched
by these unarmed docents .
that block &apos;s gonna need its own ticket .
i have a family membership .
well , if that &apos;s your kid , kiss it .
what next ?
proto @-@ cubists ?
the pointillists ?
or the alleged art of itchy and scratchy ?
ooh , ooh , i like the impressionists .
the boy bands of the art world .
but for you , lisa , i shall face the renoir with sangfroid .
warmer . calder .
warmer . warmer . calder .
calder . calder !
that &apos;s using your $ 300,000 m.f.a.
to the calder mobile !
bob , you saved me !
but how did you get the strength ?
calder &apos;s work in this period was marked by heavy use
of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy .
well put .
thank you .
answer the question .
well ... there is something i should have told you .
you see , it occurred to me
that if i can genetically modify fruits and vegetables ,
why can &apos;t i modify ... me ? !
you &apos;ve been changing your dna ? !
well , at first , just a peptide here and there .
carrot for my presbyopia , brahma bull for strength ,
and a touch of corn for highlights on my hair .
so ... how strong are you ?
figurines .
get your porcelain figurines .
now , how about those impressionists ?
i ... but we sang gershwin together !
well , rhapsody in boo @-@ hoo .
do you know why we came to the museum today ?
well , i thought it was because it was tote bag day .
well , that was part of it , but the biggest part was that !
washington &apos;s backbone , einstein &apos;s eyebrows .
florence nightingale &apos;s tenacity ,
though i &apos;ll have to clip around her moral fiber .
you &apos;re going to take dna
from these historical figures and add it to your own !
i shall be the wisest and strongest maniac
ever to bring the blessings of dictatorship to the world !
jig &apos;s up , bob !
return the spear to the homo erectus .
homo erectus ?
where has that word been all my life ?
now , bart , i promised i wouldn &apos;t hurt you .
you did that for me ?
more for mom , but yes .
but beware , i have dna in me
from ophiocordyceps unilateralis ,
better known as ...
zombie ant fungus !
and we &apos;re scared of that because ... ?
what i am saying is , i could be tipped
into a murderous rage by the slightest provocation .
could you take a picture of me with my family ?
oh , would you take another for safety ?
oh , i think my eyes were shut in that one .
now , can you take one with my husband &apos;s camera ?
they &apos;re all ugly because you &apos;re in them !
taste praxiteles of athens !
uh , chief , we got a report of a disturbance at the met .
we got bigger problems , lou .
horny teens who should be out having bad sex ,
but instead somebody made them take an abstinence pledge ,
by the looks of it .
i don &apos;t get it . there are taboos
about premarital sex in the middle east ,
and you don &apos;t see those people getting all violent .
you can &apos;t escape me !
i &apos;ve got grasshopper thighs and the sonar of a killer whale !
uh , bob , you can &apos;t kill us without a little singing , right ?
a little singing ?
if there &apos;s one thing he did not have
to genetically enhance , it &apos;s his voice .
how dare you torture my children with mozart !
ah , you know mozart ?
i call all music mozart !
we &apos;re here to stop you with the help of
the teenage abstinence class !
if you defeat this madman ,
i &apos;ll release you from your pledge
and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant .
i think i might be pregnant already .
well , that &apos;s one of &apos; em .
python jaw ... unhinge !
i don &apos;t want to die in some old dude &apos;s mouth !
bob , would you look at yourself ? !
to quote whitman , &quot; this is what you shall do :
&quot; love the earth and sun and animals ,
despise riches ,
stand up for the stupid and crazy ... &quot;
who am i kidding ?
my only exit ... is a final one .
what ? ! no !
farewell , simpsons .
and , lisa , when you &apos;re older ,
write an autobiographical novel trashing the rest of them .
how veiled ?
thinly !
now , don &apos;t worry .
your friend will always be part of our drinking water .
oh , right , i gave myself gills .
i told you , the only dancing i like is square .
hey , i let you pay for those boys &apos; skipping lessons .
okay .
ooh ! ned ! ha !
sure do miss that laugh .
ha , ha ! i miss her , too .
