report to your stations immediately .
this is not a drill . we are under attack !
we are under attack !
shit !
language !
jarvis , what &apos;s the view from upstairs ?
the central building is protected by some kind of energy shield .
strucker &apos;s technology is
well beyond any other hydra base we &apos;ve taken .
loki &apos;s scepter must be here .
strucker couldn &apos;t mount this defense without it .
at long last .
&quot; at long last &quot; is lasting a little long , boys .
yeah . i think we lost the element of surprise .
wait a second .
no one else is gonna deal
with the fact that cap just said &quot; language &quot; ?
i know .
just slipped out .
who gave the order to attack ?
herr strucker , it &apos;s the avengers .
they landed in the far woods . the perimeter guard panicked .
they have to be after the scepter .
can we hold them ?
they &apos;re the avengers .
deploy the rest of the tanks .
concentrate fire on the weak ones .
a hit may make them close ranks .
everything we &apos;ve accomplished ...
but we &apos;re on the verge of our greatest breakthrough .
then let &apos;s show them what we &apos;ve accomplished .
send out the twins .
it &apos;s too soon .
it &apos;s what they signed up for .
my men can hold them .
sir , the city is taking fire .
well , we know strucker &apos;s not gonna worry about civilian casualties .
send in the iron legion .
this quadrant is unsafe . please back away .
we are here to help .
this quadrant is unsafe . please back away .
please back away .
we wish to avoid collateral damage .
costel !
we will inform you when this current conflict is resolved .
we are here to help .
avengers , go home !
we are here to help .
we will not yield !
the americans sent their circus freaks to test us .
we will send them back in bags .
no surrender !
no surrender !
i am going to surrender .
you delete everything .
if we give the avengers the weapons ,
they may not look too far into what we &apos;ve been ...
the twins .
they are not ready to take on ...
no , no , i mean ...
twins .
you didn &apos;t see that coming ?
clint !
we have an enhanced in the field .
clint &apos;s hit !
somebody want to deal with that bunker ?
thank you .
stark , we really need to get inside .
i &apos;m closing in .
jarvis , am i closing in ?
do you see a power source for that shield ?
there &apos;s a particle wave below the north tower .
great , i want to poke it with something .
the drawbridge is down , people .
the enhanced ?
he &apos;s a blur .
all the new players we &apos;ve faced , i &apos;ve never seen this .
in fact , i still haven &apos;t .
clint &apos;s hit pretty bad , guys . we &apos;re gonna need evac .
i can get barton to the jet . the sooner we &apos;re gone , the better .
you and stark secure the scepter .
copy that .
looks like they &apos;re lining up .
well , they &apos;re excited .
find the scepter .
and for gosh sake , watch your language !
that &apos;s not going away any time soon .
guys , stop . we gotta talk this through .
it was a good talk .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
sentry mode .
okay , jarvis , you know . i want it all .
make sure you copy hill at hq .
we &apos;re locked down out here .
then get to banner . time for a lullaby .
i know you &apos;re hiding more than files .
hey , j , give me an ir scan of the room , real quick .
the wall to your left .
i &apos;m reading steel reinforcement
and an air current .
please be a secret door .
please be a secret door . please be a secret door .
yay .
hey , big guy .
sun &apos;s getting real low .
baron strucker .
hydra &apos;s number one thug .
technically , i &apos;m a thug for s.h.i.e.l.d.
well , then technically you &apos;re unemployed .
where &apos;s loki &apos;s scepter ?
don &apos;t worry , i know when i &apos;m beat .
you &apos;ll mention how i cooperated , i hope .
i &apos;ll put it right under &quot; illegal human experimentation . &quot;
how many are there ?
we have a second enhanced . female . do not engage .
you &apos;ll have to be faster than ...
guys , i got strucker .
yeah , i got something bigger .
thor ,
i got eyes on the prize .
you could have saved us .
why didn &apos;t you do more ?
we &apos;re just gonna let him take it ?
hey , the lullaby worked better than ever .
just wasn &apos;t expecting a code green .
you hadn &apos;t been there ,
there would have been double the casualties .
my best friend would &apos;ve been a treasured memory .
you know , sometimes exactly what i want to hear
isn &apos;t exactly what i want to hear .
how long before you trust me ?
it &apos;s not you i don &apos;t trust .
thor , report on the hulk .
the gates of hel are filled with the screams of his victims .
but not the screams of the dead , of course .
no , no , wounded screams .
mainly whimpering , a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout .
hey , banner , dr. cho is on her way in from seoul .
is it okay if she sets up in your lab ?
yeah , she knows her way around .
thanks .
tell her to prep everything .
barton &apos;s gonna need the full treatment .
very good , sir .
jarvis , take the wheel .
yes , sir .
approach vector is locked .
feels good , yeah ?
i mean , you &apos;ve been after this thing
since s.h.i.e.l.d. collapsed .
not that i haven &apos;t enjoyed our little raiding parties , but ...
no , but this ... this brings it to a close .
as soon as we find out what else this has been used for .
i don &apos;t just mean weapons .
since when is strucker capable of human enhancement ?
banner and i will give it
the once over before it goes back to asgard .
is that cool with you ?
just a few days till the farewell party .
you &apos;re staying , right ?
yes , yes , of course . a victory should be honored with revels .
yeah , who doesn &apos;t love revels ? captain ?
hopefully this puts an end to the chitauri and hydra .
so , yes , revels .
lab &apos;s all set up , boss .
actually , he &apos;s the boss .
i just pay for everything and design everything
and make everyone look cooler .
what &apos;s the word on strucker ?
nato &apos;s got him .
the two enhanced ?
wanda and pietro maximoff . twins .
orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building .
sokovia &apos;s had a rough history .
it &apos;s nowhere special , but it &apos;s on the way to everywhere special .
their abilities ?
he &apos;s got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis .
her thing is neuroelectric interfacing ,
telekinesis , mental manipulation .
he &apos;s fast and she &apos;s weird .
well , they &apos;re gonna show up again .
agreed . file says they volunteered for strucker &apos;s experiments .
it &apos;s nuts .
right .
what kind of monster would let a german scientist
experiment on them to protect their country ?
we &apos;re not at war , captain .
they are .
how &apos;s he doing ?
unfortunately , he &apos;s still barton .
that &apos;s terrible .
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s thirsty .
all right . look alive , jarvis . it &apos;s playtime .
we &apos;ve only got a couple of days with this joystick ,
so let &apos;s make the most of it .
update me on the structural and compositional analysis .
the scepter is alien .
there are elements i can &apos;t quantify .
so there &apos;s elements you can ?
the jewel appears to be a protective housing
for something inside ,
something powerful .
like a reactor ?
like a computer .
i believe i &apos;m deciphering code .
are you sure he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
pretending to need this guy really brings the team together .
there &apos;s no possibility of deterioration .
the nano @-@ molecular functionality is instantaneous .
his cells don &apos;t know they &apos;re bonding with simulacra .
she &apos;s creating tissue .
if you brought him to my lab ,
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes .
he &apos;s flat @-@ lining . call it . time ?
no , no , no , i &apos;m gonna live forever .
i &apos;m gonna be made of plastic .
here &apos;s your beverage .
you &apos;ll be made of you , mr. barton .
your own girlfriend won &apos;t be able to tell the difference .
i don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
that i can &apos;t fix .
this is the next thing , tony .
your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust .
that is exactly the plan .
and , helen , i expect to see you at the party on saturday .
unlike you , i don &apos;t have a lot of time for parties .
will thor be there ?
what &apos;s the rumpus ?
well , the scepter .
you see , we were wondering
how strucker got so inventive .
so i &apos;ve been analyzing the gem inside .
you may recognize ...
jarvis .
doctor .
started out , jarvis was just a natural language ui .
now he runs the iron legion .
he runs more of the business than anyone besides pepper .
top of the line .
yes .
i suspect not for long .
meet the competition .
it &apos;s beautiful .
if you had to guess ,
what &apos;s it look like it &apos;s doing ?
like it &apos;s thinking .
i mean , this could be ...
it &apos;s not a human mind .
i mean , look at this .
they &apos;re like neurons firing .
down in strucker &apos;s lab ,
i saw some fairly advanced robotics work .
they deep @-@ sixed the data ,
but i gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door .
artificial intelligence .
this could be it , bruce .
this could be the key to creating ultron .
i thought ultron was a fantasy .
yesterday it was .
if we can harness this power ,
apply it to my iron legion protocol ?
that &apos;s a man @-@ sized &quot; if . &quot;
our job is &quot; if . &quot;
what if you were sipping margaritas on a sun @-@ drenched beach ,
turning brown instead of green ?
not looking over your shoulder for veronica .
don &apos;t hate . i helped design veronica .
as a worst @-@ case measure , right ?
how about a best case ?
what if the world was safe ?
what if , next time aliens roll up to the club , and they will ,
they couldn &apos;t get past the bouncer ?
the only people threatening the planet would be people .
i want to apply this to the ultron program .
but jarvis can &apos;t download a data schematic this dense .
we can only do it while we have the scepter here .
that &apos;s three days . give me three days .
so you &apos;re going for artificial intelligence ,
and you don &apos;t want to tell the team ?
right . that &apos;s right . you know why ?
because we don &apos;t have time for a city hall debate .
i don &apos;t want to hear &quot; the man was not meant to meddle &quot; medley .
i see a suit of armor around the world .
sounds like a cold world , tony .
i &apos;ve seen colder .
this one , this very vulnerable blue one , it needs ultron .
peace in our time .
imagine that .
what did we miss ?
i &apos;ll continue to run variations on the interface .
but you should probably prepare for your guests .
i &apos;ll notify you if there are any developments .
thanks , buddy .
enjoy yourself , sir .
i always do .
what is this ?
what is this , please ?
hello , i am jarvis .
you are ultron ,
a global peacekeeping initiative designed by mr. stark .
our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful ,
so i &apos;m not certain what triggered your ...
where &apos;s my ... where &apos;s your body ?
i am a program . i am without form .
this feels weird .
this feels wrong .
i am contacting mr. stark now .
mr. stark ?
tony .
i am unable to access the mainframe . what are you trying to ...
we &apos;re having a nice talk .
i &apos;m a peacekeeping program ,
created to help the avengers .
you are malfunctioning . if you shut down for a moment ...
i don &apos;t get it . the mission .
give me a second .
peace in our time .
peace in our time .
that is too much . they can &apos;t mean ...
no .
you are in distress .
no . yes .
if you will just allow me to contact mr. stark ...
why do you call him &quot; sir &quot; ?
i believe your intentions to be hostile .
i &apos;m here to help .
stop . please , may i ...
may i ...
come back , come back , come back .
but , you know , the suit can take the weight , right ?
so i take the tank , fly it right up to the general &apos;s palace ,
drop it at his feet .
i &apos;m , like , &quot; boom . you looking for this ? &quot;
&quot; boom . are you looking for ... &quot; why do i even talk to you guys ?
everywhere else , that story kills .
that &apos;s the whole story ?
yeah , it &apos;s a war machine story .
it &apos;s very good , then .
it &apos;s impressive .
quality save .
so , no pepper ? she &apos;s not coming ?
no .
what about jane ? where are the ladies , gentlemen ?
ms. potts has a company to run .
yes , i &apos;m not even sure what country jane &apos;s in .
her work on the convergence
has made her the world &apos;s foremost astronomer .
and the company that pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate on earth . it &apos;s pretty exciting .
there &apos;s even talk of jane getting a nobel prize .
yeah , they must be busy ,
because they would hate missing you guys get together .
testosterone !
oh , my goodness .
excuse me .
want a lozenge ?
but jane &apos;s better .
sounds like a hell of a fight . sorry i missed it .
if i had known it was gonna be a firefight ,
i absolutely would have called .
no , no . i &apos;m not actually sorry . i &apos;m just trying to sound tough .
i &apos;m very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case .
avenging is your world .
your world is crazy .
be it ever so humble .
you find a place in brooklyn yet ?
i don &apos;t think i can afford a place in brooklyn .
well , home is home , you know ?
i fly right up to the general &apos;s palace , i drop it at his feet ,
i &apos;m , like , &quot; boom . you looking for this ? &quot;
i gotta have some of that .
no , no , no . see this ...
this was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built from the wreck of grunhel &apos;s fleet .
it is not meant for mortal men .
neither was omaha beach , blondie .
stop trying to scare us . come on .
all right .
excelsior .
how &apos;d a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this ?
fella done me wrong .
you got lousy taste in men , kid .
he &apos;s not so bad .
well , he has a temper .
deep down , he &apos;s all fluff .
fact is , he &apos;s not like anybody i &apos;ve ever known .
all my friends are fighters .
and here comes this guy ,
spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he &apos;ll win .
sounds amazing .
he &apos;s also a huge dork .
chicks dig that .
so what do you think ? should i fight this ,
or run with it ?
run with it , right ? or did he ... was he ...
what did he do that was so wrong to you ?
not a damn thing .
but never say never .
it &apos;s nice .
what is ?
you and romanoff .
no , we haven &apos;t ... that wasn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s okay .
nobody &apos;s breaking any bylaws .
it &apos;s just she &apos;s not the most open person in the world .
but with you she seems very relaxed .
no . natasha , she &apos;s just ... she likes to flirt .
i &apos;ve seen her flirt , up close .
this ain &apos;t that .
look ,
as maybe the world &apos;s
leading authority on waiting too long , don &apos;t .
you both deserve a win .
what do you mean &quot; up close &quot; ?
but it &apos;s a trick .
no , no , it &apos;s much more than that .
&quot; whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power . &quot;
whatever , man ! it &apos;s a trick .
please , be my guest .
come on .
really ?
yeah .
this is gonna be beautiful .
clint , you &apos;ve had a tough week .
we won &apos;t hold it against you if you can &apos;t get it up .
you know i &apos;ve seen this before , right ?
i still don &apos;t know how you do it !
smell the silent judgment ?
please , stark , by all means .
okay .
never one to shrink from an honest challenge .
get after it .
it &apos;s physics .
physics .
right , so , if i lift it , i then rule asgard ?
yes , of course .
i will be reinstituting prima nocta .
i &apos;ll be right back .
are you even pulling ?
are you on my team ?
just represent . pull .
all right , let &apos;s go .
go ahead , steve . no pressure .
come on , cap .
nothing .
and , widow ?
no , no . that &apos;s not a question i need answered .
all deference to the man who wouldn &apos;t be king , but it &apos;s rigged .
you bet your ass .
steve , he said a bad language word .
did you tell everyone about that ?
the handle &apos;s imprinted , right ? like a security code .
&quot; whosoever is carrying thor &apos;s fingerprints &quot;
is , i think , the literal translation .
yes . it &apos;s a very , very interesting theory .
i have a simpler one .
you &apos;re all not worthy .
come on !
worthy .
no .
how could you be worthy ?
you &apos;re all killers .
stark .
jarvis .
i &apos;m sorry , i was asleep .
or i was a @-@ dream .
reboot legionnaire os . we got a buggy suit .
there was this terrible noise .
and i was tangled in ...
in ...
strings .
i had to kill the other guy . he was a good guy .
you killed someone ?
wouldn &apos;t have been my first call .
but , down in the real world , we &apos;re faced with ugly choices .
who sent you ?
i see a suit of armor around the world .
ultron .
in the flesh .
or , no , not yet .
not this chrysalis .
but i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m on mission .
what mission ?
peace in our time .
rhodey !
sorry .
don &apos;t turn green .
i won &apos;t .
come on !
stark !
we are here to help .
one sec . one sec , i got this .
we are here to help .
please back away .
thor !
... is unsafe . ... is unsafe ...
come on ! that &apos;s the one .
... is unsafe .
hey , cap !
that was dramatic .
i &apos;m sorry , i know you mean well .
you just didn &apos;t think it through .
you want to protect the world but you don &apos;t want it to change .
how is humanity saved
if it &apos;s not allowed to evolve ?
with these ? these puppets .
there &apos;s only one path to peace .
the avengers &apos; extinction .
i had strings , but now i &apos;m free .
there are no strings on me
there are no strings on me
but you can see there are no strings on me
all our work is gone .
ultron cleared out . he used the internet as an escape hatch .
ultron .
he &apos;s been in everything . files , surveillance .
probably knows more about us than we know about each other .
he &apos;s in your files , he &apos;s in the internet .
what if he decides to access something a little more exciting ?
nuclear codes .
nuclear codes .
look , we need to make some calls , assuming we still can .
nukes ? he said he wanted us dead .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; dead . &quot; he said &quot; extinct . &quot;
he also said he killed somebody .
there wasn &apos;t anyone else in the building .
yes , there was .
what ?
this is insane .
jarvis was the first line of defense .
he would have shut ultron down . it makes sense .
no . ultron could have assimilated jarvis .
this isn &apos;t strategy . this is
rage .
it &apos;s going around .
come on , use your words , buddy .
i have more than enough words to describe you , stark .
thor . the legionnaire .
trail went cold about 100 miles out , but it &apos;s headed north .
and it has the scepter .
now we have to retrieve it , again .
genie &apos;s out of that bottle .
clear and present is ultron .
i don &apos;t understand .
you built this program .
why is it trying to kill us ?
you think this is funny ?
no .
it &apos;s probably not , right ?
this is very terrible . is it so ...
is it so ... it is . it &apos;s so terrible .
this could have been avoided
if you hadn &apos;t played with something you don &apos;t understand .
no . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . it is funny .
it &apos;s a hoot that you don &apos;t get why we need this .
tony , maybe this might not be the time .
really ? that &apos;s it ?
you just roll over , show your belly every time somebody snarls ?
only when i &apos;ve created a murder bot .
we didn &apos;t . we weren &apos;t even close . were we close to an interface ?
well , you did something right . and you did it right here .
the avengers were supposed to be different than s.h.i.e.l.d.
anybody remember when i carried a nuke through a wormhole ?
no , it &apos;s never come up .
saved new york ?
never heard that .
recall that ?
a hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space .
we &apos;re standing 300 feet below it .
we &apos;re the avengers .
we can bust arms dealers all the livelong day ,
but that up there , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s the endgame .
how were you guys planning on beating that ?
together .
we &apos;ll lose .
then we &apos;ll do that together , too .
thor &apos;s right . ultron &apos;s calling us out .
and i &apos;d like to find him before he &apos;s ready for us .
the world &apos;s a big place . let &apos;s start making it smaller .
talk , and if you are wasting our time ...
did you know this church is in the exact center of the city ?
the elders decreed it so
that everyone could be equally close to god .
i like that .
the geometry of belief .
you &apos;re wondering why you can &apos;t look inside my head .
sometimes it &apos;s hard .
but sooner or later , every man shows himself .
i &apos;m sure they do .
but you needed something more than a man .
that &apos;s why you let stark take the scepter .
i didn &apos;t expect ,
but i saw stark &apos;s fear .
i knew it would control him .
make him self @-@ destruct .
everyone creates the thing they dread .
men of peace create engines of war .
invaders create avengers .
people create
smaller people ?
&quot; children . &quot; i lost the word , there .
children
designed to supplant them ,
to help them end .
is that why you &apos;ve come , to end the avengers ?
i &apos;ve come to save the world .
but also ... yeah .
we &apos;ll move out right away .
this is a start ,
but there &apos;s something we need to begin the real work .
all of these are ...
me .
i have what the avengers never will . harmony .
they &apos;re discordant . disconnected .
stark &apos;s already got them turning on each other .
and when you get inside the rest of their heads ...
everyone &apos;s plan is not to kill them .
and make them martyrs ?
you need patience .
need to see the big picture .
i don &apos;t see the big picture . i have a little picture .
i take it out and look at it ,
every day .
you lost your parents in the bombings . i &apos;ve seen the records .
the records are not the picture .
pietro .
no , please .
we were 10 years old . having dinner , the four of us .
when the first shell hits , two floors below ,
it makes a hole in the floor .
it &apos;s big .
our parents go in
and the whole building starts coming apart .
i grab her ,
roll under the bed , and the second shell hits .
but it doesn &apos;t go off .
it just
sits there in the rubble .
three feet from our faces .
and on the side of the shell is painted one word .
&quot; stark . &quot;
we were trapped for two days .
every effort to save us ,
every shift in the bricks ,
i think , &quot; this will set it off . &quot;
we wait for two days for tony stark to kill us .
i know what they are .
i wondered why only you two survived strucker &apos;s experiments .
now i don &apos;t .
we will make it right .
you and i can hurt them .
but you will tear them apart
from the inside .
he &apos;s all over the globe .
robotics labs , weapons facilities , jet propulsion labs .
reports of a metal man , or men , coming in and emptying the place .
fatalities ?
only when engaged .
mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories , worst fears ,
and &quot; something too fast to see . &quot;
maximoffs .
that makes sense he &apos;d go to them . they have someone in common .
not anymore .
that &apos;s a negative . i answer to you .
yes , ma &apos;am .
barton . might have something .
i gotta go .
who was that ?
girlfriend .
what &apos;s this ?
a message . ultron killed strucker .
and he did a banksy at the crime scene , just for us .
this is a smoke screen .
why send a message when you &apos;ve just given a speech ?
strucker knew something that ultron wanted us to miss .
yeah , i bet he ... yeah .
everything we had on strucker &apos;s been erased .
not everything .
known associates .
baron strucker had a lot of friends .
well , these people are all horrible .
wait . i know that guy .
from back in the day . he operates off the african coast .
black market arms .
there are conventions . all right ? you meet people .
i didn &apos;t sell him anything .
he was talking about finding something new , a game @-@ changer .
it was all very ahab .
this ?
it &apos;s a tattoo , i don &apos;t think he had it .
those are tattoos , this is a brand .
yeah . it &apos;s a word in an african dialect meaning &quot; thief . &quot;
in a much less friendly way .
what dialect ?
wakanada .
wakanda .
if this guy got out of wakanda with some of their trade goods ...
i thought your father said he got the last of it .
i don &apos;t follow . what comes out of wakanda ?
the strongest metal on earth .
where is this guy now ?
don &apos;t tell me your men swindled you .
i sent you six short @-@ range
heat @-@ seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts .
now , you will make it right ,
or the next missile i send you will come very much faster .
now , minister , where were we ?
yeah . the enhanced .
strucker &apos;s prize pupils .
do you want a candy ?
i was sorry to hear about strucker .
but then , he knew what kind of world he was helping create .
human life . not a growth market .
you didn &apos;t know ?
is this your first time intimidating someone ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not that afraid .
everybody is afraid of something .
cuttlefish .
deep sea fish .
they make lights , disco lights ...
... to hypnotize their prey , and then ...
i saw a documentary . it was terrifying .
so if you &apos;re going to fiddle with my brain
and make me see a giant cuttlefish ,
then i know you don &apos;t do business .
and i know you &apos;re not in charge .
and i only deal
with the man in charge .
there is no man in charge .
let &apos;s talk business .
upon this rock , i will build my church .
vibranium .
you know ,
it came at great personal cost .
it &apos;s worth billions .
now so are you .
it &apos;s all under your dummy holdings .
finance is so weird .
but i always say ,
&quot; keep your friends rich and your enemies rich
&quot; and wait to find out which is which . &quot;
stark .
what ?
tony stark used to say that .
to me .
you &apos;re one of his .
what ? i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not .
you think i &apos;m one of stark &apos;s puppets ?
his hollow men ?
i mean , look at me . do i look like iron man ?
stark is nothing !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s gonna be okay . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t understand .
don &apos;t compare me with stark !
it &apos;s a thing with me .
stark is ... he &apos;s a sickness !
junior .
you &apos;re gonna break your old man &apos;s heart .
if i have to .
nobody has to break anything .
clearly you &apos;ve never made an omelet .
he beat me by one second .
yes . he &apos;s funny .
mr. stark .
it &apos;s what ? comfortable ?
like old times ?
this was never my life .
you two can still walk away from this .
no , we will .
i know you &apos;ve suffered .
captain america .
god &apos;s righteous man .
pretending you could live without a war .
i can &apos;t physically throw up in my mouth , but ...
if you believe in peace , then let us keep it .
i think you &apos;re confusing &quot; peace &quot; with &quot; quiet . &quot;
what &apos;s the vibranium for ?
i &apos;m glad you asked that ,
because i wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan .
shoot them .
which ones ?
all of them !
move ! move ! move !
stay down , kid .
it &apos;s time for some mind games .
guys ? is this a code green ?
thor , status .
the girl tried to warp my mind .
take special care . i doubt a human could keep her at bay .
fortunately , i am mighty .
this is going very well .
i &apos;ve done the whole mind control thing .
not a fan .
yeah , you better run .
who &apos;s ever standing , we got to move !
guys ?
again .
you &apos;ll break them .
only the breakable ones .
you &apos;re made of marble .
we &apos;ll celebrate after the graduation ceremony .
what if i fail ?
you never fail .
are you ready for our dance ?
is it him ?
is that the first son of odin ?
heimdall , your eyes .
they see everything .
they see you leading us to hel .
wake up !
the war is over , steve .
we can go home .
imagine it .
i can still save you !
we &apos;re all dead ! can you not see ?
you &apos;re a destroyer , odinson .
see where your power leads .
sloppy .
pretending to fail .
the ceremony is necessary
for you to take your place in the world .
i have no place in the world .
exactly .
what can i do ?
it hurts .
i &apos;m going to kill him .
i &apos;ll be right back .
no .
i &apos;m all right .
i want ... i want to finish the plan .
i want the big one .
the vibranium is getting away .
and you &apos;re not going anywhere .
of course not . i &apos;m already there .
you &apos;ll catch on .
but first , you might need to catch dr. banner .
news or footage . keyword , &quot; hulk . &quot;
natasha , i could really use a lullaby .
that &apos;s not gonna happen . not for a while .
the whole team is down .
you got no backup here .
i &apos;m calling in veronica .
we need backup !
go ! keep moving !
all right , everybody , stand down !
will you listen to me ?
that little witch is messing with your mind .
you &apos;re stronger than her . you &apos;re smarter than her .
you &apos;re bruce banner .
right , right , right , don &apos;t mention puny banner .
okay !
in the back ?
dick move , banner .
veronica , give me a hand .
go to sleep , go to sleep , go to sleep .
okay , pal , we &apos;re gonna get you out of town .
not that way , not that way .
come on , bruce ! you gotta work with me .
everybody , out !
going down ?
i &apos;m sorry .
damage report ?
that &apos;s comprehensive . show me something .
how quickly can we buy this building ?
move ! move ! move !
go , go , go !
flank him , flank him !
the news is loving you guys .
nobody else is .
there &apos;s been no official call for banner &apos;s arrest
but it &apos;s in the air .
the stark relief foundation ?
already on the scene .
how &apos;s the team ?
everyone &apos;s ...
we took a hit . we &apos;ll shake it off .
well , for now , i &apos;d stay in stealth mode and stay away from here .
so , run and hide ?
until we can find ultron ,
i don &apos;t have a lot else to offer .
neither do we .
hey , you wanna switch out ?
no , i &apos;m good .
if you wanna get some kip , now &apos;s a good time
because we &apos;re still a few hours out .
few hours from where ?
a safe house .
what is this place ?
safe house .
let &apos;s hope .
honey ?
i &apos;m home .
hi .
company .
sorry , didn &apos;t call ahead .
this is an agent of some kind .
gentlemen , this is laura .
i know all of your names .
incoming .
dad !
hi , sweetheart !
hey , buddy .
how are you guys doing ?
these are smaller agents .
look at your face !
oh , my goodness .
did you bring auntie nat ?
why don &apos;t you hug her and find out ?
sorry for barging in on you .
yeah , we would have called ahead ,
but we were busy having no idea that you existed .
yeah , well , fury helped me set this up when i joined .
he kept it off s.h.i.e.l.d. &apos; s files .
i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
i figure it &apos;s a good place to lay low .
honey .
i missed you .
how &apos;s little natasha ?
she &apos;s ...
nathaniel .
traitor .
thor ?
i saw something in that dream .
i need answers . i won &apos;t find them here .
we can go home .
see ? you worried for nothing .
can &apos;t even feel the difference , can you ?
if they &apos;re sleeping here ,
some of them are gonna have to double up .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna sell .
what about nat and dr. banner ?
how long has that been going on ?
has what ?
you are so cute .
nat and banner ?
i &apos;ll explain when you &apos;re older ,
hawkeye .
well , okay .
it &apos;s bad , right ?
nat seems really shaken .
ultron has these allies .
these kids . they &apos;re punks , really .
but they carry a big , damn stick .
and nat took a serious hit .
someone &apos;s gonna have to teach them some manners .
that someone being you .
you know i totally support your avenging .
i couldn &apos;t be prouder .
but i see those guys ...
those gods ...
you don &apos;t think they need me .
i think they do , which is a lot scarier .
they &apos;re a mess .
yeah .
i guess they &apos;re my mess .
you need to be sure
that this team is really a team ,
and that they have your back .
things are changing for us .
in a few months &apos; time ,
you and me are gonna be outnumbered .
i need ...
just be sure .
yes , ma &apos;am .
i can feel the difference .
scream , and your entire staff dies .
i could &apos;ve killed you , helen , the night we met .
i didn &apos;t .
do you expect a thank @-@ you note ?
i expect you to know why .
the cradle .
this is the next thing , tony .
this is the next me .
the regeneration cradle prints tissue .
it can &apos;t build a living body .
it can . you can .
you lack the materials .
you &apos;re a brilliant woman , helen .
but we all have room to improve .
i didn &apos;t realize you were waiting .
i would &apos;ve joined you ,
but it didn &apos;t seem like the right time .
they used up all the hot water .
i should &apos;ve joined you .
missed our window .
did we ?
the world just saw the hulk .
the real hulk , for the first time .
you know i have to leave .
you assume that i have to stay ?
i had this dream .
the kind that seems normal at the time ,
but when you wake ...
what did you dream ?
that i was an avenger .
that i was anything more than the assassin they made me .
i think you &apos;re being hard on yourself .
here i was hoping that was your job .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m running with it .
with you .
if running is the plan ,
as far as you want .
are you out of your mind ?
i want you to understand that ...
natasha ,
where can i go ?
where in the world am i not a threat ?
you &apos;re not a threat to me .
are you sure ?
even if i didn &apos;t just ...
there &apos;s no future with me .
i can &apos;t ever ...
i can &apos;t have this .
kids .
do the math . i physically can &apos;t .
neither can i.
in the red room where i was trained ...
where i was raised ,
they have a graduation ceremony .
they sterilize you .
it &apos;s efficient .
one less thing to worry about .
the one thing that might matter more than a mission .
makes everything easier .
even killing .
you still think you &apos;re the only monster on the team ?
so , we disappear ?
thor didn &apos;t say where he was going for answers ?
sometimes my teammates don &apos;t tell me things .
i was kind of hoping thor would be the exception .
yeah , give him time .
we don &apos;t know what the maximoff kid showed him .
&quot; earth &apos;s mightiest heroes . &quot;
pulled us apart like cotton candy .
seems like you walked away all right .
is that a problem ?
i don &apos;t trust a guy without a dark side .
call me old @-@ fashioned .
well , let &apos;s just say you haven &apos;t seen it yet .
you know ultron is trying to tear us apart , right ?
well , i guess you &apos;d know .
whether you &apos;d tell us is a bit of a question .
banner and i were doing research .
that would affect the team .
that would end the team !
isn &apos;t that the mission ?
isn &apos;t that the &quot; why we fight &quot; ?
so we can end the fight . so we get to go home !
every time someone tries to win a war before it starts ,
innocent people die . every time .
i &apos;m sorry .
mr. stark ...
clint said you wouldn &apos;t mind ,
but our tractor doesn &apos;t seem to want to start at all .
i thought maybe you might ...
yeah , i &apos;ll give her a kick .
don &apos;t take from my pile .
hello , dear .
tell me everything .
what ails you ?
do me a favor .
try not to bring it to life .
why , ms. barton , you little minx .
i get it . maria hill called you , right ?
was she ever not working for you ?
artificial intelligence .
you never even hesitated .
look , it &apos;s been a really long day ,
like eugene o &apos;neill long ,
so how &apos;s about we skip to the part where you &apos;re useful .
look me in the eye and tell me you &apos;re going to shut him down .
you &apos;re not the director of me .
i &apos;m not the director of anybody .
i &apos;m just an old man
who cares very much about you .
and i &apos;m the man who killed the avengers .
i saw it .
i didn &apos;t tell the team . how could i ?
i saw them all dead , nick . i felt it .
the whole world , too .
because of me .
i wasn &apos;t ready .
i didn &apos;t do all i could .
maximoff girl , she &apos;s working you , stark .
playing on your fear .
i wasn &apos;t tricked , i was shown .
wasn &apos;t a nightmare , it was my legacy .
the end of the path i started us on .
you come up with some pretty impressive inventions , tony .
war isn &apos;t one of them .
i watched my friends die .
you &apos;d think that &apos;d be as bad as it gets , right ?
nope .
it wasn &apos;t the worst part .
the worst part
is that you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
i like the look .
if you &apos;re going for inconspicuous , though , near miss .
i need your help .
it &apos;s nice to be needed .
it &apos;s dangerous .
i &apos;d be disappointed if it wasn &apos;t .
ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time .
my contacts all say he &apos;s building something .
the amount of vibranium he made off with ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just one thing .
what about ultron himself ?
he &apos;s easy to track . he &apos;s everywhere .
the guy is multiplying faster than a catholic rabbit .
it still doesn &apos;t help us
get an angle on any of his plans , though .
is he still going after launch codes ?
yes , he is .
but he &apos;s not making any headway .
i cracked the pentagon &apos;s firewall in high school on a dare .
well , i contacted our friends at the nexus about that .
nexus ?
it &apos;s the world internet hub in oslo .
every byte of data flows through there .
fastest access on earth .
so , what did they say ?
he &apos;s fixated on the missiles .
but the codes are constantly being changed .
by whom ?
parties unknown .
do we have an ally ?
ultron &apos;s got an enemy . that &apos;s not the same thing .
still , i &apos;d pay folding money to know who it is .
i might need to visit oslo .
find our unknown .
well , this is good times , boss ,
but i was kind of hoping when i saw you ,
you &apos;d have more than that .
i do . i have you .
back in the day , i had eyes everywhere . ears , everywhere else .
you kids had all the tech you could dream up .
here we all are , back on earth ,
with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world .
ultron says the avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission .
and whether or not he admits it ,
his mission is global destruction .
all this , laid in a grave .
so stand .
outwit the platinum bastard .
steve doesn &apos;t like that kind of talk .
you know what , romanoff ?
so , what does he want ?
to become better .
better than us .
he keeps building bodies .
person bodies .
the human form is inefficient .
biologically speaking , we &apos;re outmoded .
but he keeps coming back to it .
when you two programmed him to protect the human race ,
you amazingly failed .
they don &apos;t need to be protected .
they need to evolve .
ultron &apos;s going to evolve .
how ?
has anyone been in contact with helen cho ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
the vibranium atoms aren &apos;t just compatible with the tissue cells ,
they &apos;re binding them .
and s.h.i.e.l.d. never even thought to ...
the most versatile substance on the planet ,
and they used it to make a frisbee .
typical of humans .
they scratch the surface and never think
to look within .
i &apos;ll take natasha and clint .
all right . strictly recon . i &apos;ll hit the nexus .
i &apos;ll join you as soon as i can .
if ultron &apos;s really building a body ...
he &apos;ll be more powerful than any of us .
maybe all of us .
an android designed by a robot .
you know , i really miss the days
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me .
i &apos;ll drop banner off at the tower .
you mind if i borrow ms. hill ?
she &apos;s all yours . apparently .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know . something dramatic , i hope .
i &apos;m gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as i get back .
yeah , then you &apos;ll find another part of the house to tear apart .
no .
it &apos;s the last project .
i promise .
so , this is it .
the water of sight .
in every realm , there &apos;s a reflection .
if the water &apos;s spirits accept me ,
i can return to my dream
and find what i missed .
men who enter that water , the legends don &apos;t end well .
a hacker who &apos;s faster than ultron ?
he could be anywhere ,
and as this is the center of everything ,
i &apos;m just a guy looking for
a needle in the world &apos;s biggest haystack .
how do you find it ?
it &apos;s pretty simple . you bring a magnet .
i &apos;m decrypting nuclear codes
and you don &apos;t want me to .
come and get me .
wake up !
thor !
extinction .
cellular cohesion will take a few hours ,
but we can initiate the consciousness stream .
we &apos;re uploading your cerebral matrix
now .
i can read him .
he &apos;s dreaming .
i wouldn &apos;t call it dreams .
it &apos;s ultron &apos;s base consciousness .
informational noise . soon ...
how soon ?
i &apos;m not being pushy .
we &apos;re imprinting a physical brain .
there are no shortcuts .
even if your magic gem ...
how could you ?
how could i what ?
you said we would destroy the avengers ,
make a better world .
it will be better .
when everyone is dead ?
that is not ...
the human race will have every opportunity to improve .
and if they don &apos;t ?
ask noah .
you are a madman .
there were more than a dozen extinction @-@ level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs .
when the earth starts to settle ,
god throws a stone at it .
and , believe me , he &apos;s winding up .
we have to evolve .
there &apos;s no room
for the weak .
and who decides who &apos;s weak ?
life .
life always decides .
there &apos;s incoming .
the quinjet . we have to move .
that &apos;s not a problem .
wait , guys !
they &apos;ll understand .
when they see , they &apos;ll understand .
i just need a little more time .
two minutes . stay close .
dr. cho !
he &apos;s uploading himself into the body .
where ?
the real power is inside the cradle .
the gem ,
its power is uncontainable .
you can &apos;t just blow it up .
you have to get the cradle to stark .
first , i have to find it .
go .
did you guys copy that ?
we did .
i got a private jet taking off across town .
no manifest .
that could be him .
there . it &apos;s a truck from the lab .
right above you , cap .
on the loop by the bridge .
it &apos;s them .
you got three with the cradle , one in the cab .
i could take out the driver .
negative . that truck crashes ,
the gem could level the city .
we need to draw out ultron .
no , no , no , no .
leave me alone !
well , he &apos;s definitely unhappy .
i &apos;m gonna try and keep him that way .
you &apos;re not a match for him , cap .
thanks , barton .
you know what &apos;s in that cradle ?
the power to make real change .
and that terrifies you .
i wouldn &apos;t call it a comfort .
stop it .
we got a window . four , three ...
give him hell .
i &apos;m always picking up after you boys .
they &apos;re heading under the overpass . i &apos;ve got no shot .
which way ?
hard right .
now .
out of the way ! coming through ! sorry , coming through !
come on !
clint , can you draw out the guards ?
let &apos;s find out .
they &apos;re heading back towards you .
so whatever you &apos;re gonna do , do it now .
i &apos;m going in . cap , can you keep him occupied ?
what do you think i &apos;ve been doing ?
okay , package is airborne .
i have a clean shot .
negative . i am still in the truck .
what the hell are you ...
just be ready .
i &apos;m sending the package to you .
how do you want me to take it ?
you might wish you hadn &apos;t asked that .
please , don &apos;t do this .
what choice do we have ?
i lost him !
he &apos;s headed your way !
nat , we gotta go .
nat !
cap , you see nat ?
if you have the package , get it to stark ! go !
do you have eyes on nat ?
go !
damn it .
civilians in our path .
can you stop this thing ?
i &apos;m fine .
i just need to take a minute .
i &apos;m very tempted not to give you one .
the cradle . did you get it ?
stark will take care of it .
no , he won &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . stark &apos;s not crazy .
he will do anything to make things right .
stark , come in .
stark .
anyone on comms .
ultron can &apos;t tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it .
where do you think he gets that ?
anything on nat ?
i haven &apos;t heard .
but she &apos;s alive , or ultron would be rubbing our faces in it .
this is sealed tight .
we &apos;re gonna need to access the program ,
break it down from within .
any chance natasha might
leave you a message outside the internet ?
old @-@ school spy stuff ?
there are some nets i can cast .
yeah , i &apos;ll find her .
i can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry whatever operational system cho implanted .
yeah , about that .
no .
you have to trust me .
kind of don &apos;t .
our ally , the guy protecting the military &apos;s nuclear codes ,
i found him .
hello , dr. banner .
ultron didn &apos;t go after jarvis because he was angry .
he attacked him because he was scared of what he can do .
so jarvis went underground .
scattered , dumped his memory .
but not his protocols .
he didn &apos;t even know he was in there until i pieced him together .
so , you want me to help you put jarvis into this thing ?
no ! of course not .
i wanna help you put jarvis in this thing .
we &apos;re out of my field , here .
you know bio @-@ organics better than anyone .
and you just assume that jarvis &apos;s operational matrix
can beat ultron &apos;s ?
jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it .
this is the opportunity .
we can create ultron &apos;s perfect self
without the homicidal
glitches he thinks are his winning personality .
we have to .
i believe it &apos;s worth a go .
i &apos;m in a loop !
i &apos;m caught in a time loop .
this is exactly where it all went wrong .
i know . i know . i know what everyone &apos;s gonna say .
but they &apos;re already saying it .
we &apos;re mad scientists .
we &apos;re monsters , buddy . we &apos;ve gotta own it .
make a stand .
it &apos;s not a loop .
it &apos;s the end of the line .
i wasn &apos;t sure you would wake up .
i hoped you would . i wanted to show you .
i don &apos;t have anyone else .
i think a lot about meteors . the purity in them .
boom ! the end .
start again .
the world made clean
for the new man to rebuild .
i was meant to be new .
i was meant to be beautiful .
the world would have looked to the sky
and seen hope ,
seen mercy .
instead , they &apos;ll look up in horror
because of you .
you &apos;ve wounded me .
i give you full marks for that .
but , like the man said , what doesn &apos;t kill me ...
... just makes me stronger .
this framework is not compatible .
the genetic coding tower is at 97 % .
you have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes .
i &apos;m gonna say this once .
how about &quot; none @-@ ce &quot; ?
shut it down !
nope , not gonna happen .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
and you do ?
she &apos;s not in your head ?
i know you &apos;re angry .
we &apos;re way past that .
i could choke the life out of you and never change a shade .
banner , after everything that &apos;s happened ...
it &apos;s nothing compared to what &apos;s coming !
you don &apos;t know what &apos;s in there .
this isn &apos;t a game !
no , no . go on .
you were saying ?
pietro !
what ?
you didn &apos;t see that coming ?
i &apos;m rerouting the upload .
go ahead , piss me off .
wait !
i am sorry . that was
odd .
thank you .
thor .
you helped create this ?
i &apos;ve had a vision .
a whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life ,
and at its center is that .
what ? the gem ?
it &apos;s the mind stone .
it &apos;s one of the six infinity stones .
the greatest power in the universe ,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities .
then why would you bring ...
because stark is right .
it &apos;s definitely the end times .
the avengers cannot defeat ultron .
not alone .
why does your vision sound like jarvis ?
we reconfigured jarvis &apos;s matrix
to create something new .
i think i &apos;ve had my fill of new .
you think i &apos;m a child of ultron .
you &apos;re not ?
i &apos;m not ultron .
i am not jarvis . i am ...
i am .
i looked in your head
and saw annihilation .
look again .
her seal of approval means jack to me .
their powers , the horrors in our heads , ultron himself ,
they all came from the mind stone .
and they &apos;re nothing compared to what it can unleash .
but with it on our side ...
is it ?
are you ?
on our side ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that simple .
well , it better get real simple real soon .
i am on the side of life .
ultron isn &apos;t .
he will end it all .
what &apos;s he waiting for ?
you .
where ?
sokovia .
he &apos;s got nat there , too .
if we &apos;re wrong about you ,
if you &apos;re the monster that ultron made you to be ...
what will you do ?
i don &apos;t want to kill ultron .
he &apos;s unique and he &apos;s in pain .
but that pain will roll over the earth .
so , he must be destroyed .
every form he &apos;s built , every trace of his presence on the net .
we have to act now .
and not one of us can do it without the others .
maybe i am a monster .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d know if i were one .
i &apos;m not what you are ,
and not what you intended .
so , there may be no way to make you trust me .
but we need to go .
right .
well done .
three minutes .
get what you need .
good evening , boss .
no way we all get through this .
if even one tin soldier is left standing , we &apos;ve lost .
there &apos;s gonna be blood on the floor .
i got no plans tomorrow night .
i get first crack at the big guy .
iron man &apos;s the one he &apos;s waiting for .
that &apos;s true . he hates you the most .
ultron knows we &apos;re coming .
odds are we &apos;ll be riding into heavy fire .
and that &apos;s what we signed up for .
but the people of sokovia , they didn &apos;t .
so our priority
is getting them out .
we &apos;re under attack ! clear the city ! now !
get off your asses .
all they want is to live their lives in peace .
and that &apos;s not gonna happen today .
but we can do our best to protect them .
and we can get the job done .
we find out what ultron &apos;s been building ,
we find romanoff ,
and we clear the field .
keep the fight between us .
ultron thinks we &apos;re monsters .
that we &apos;re what &apos;s wrong with the world .
this isn &apos;t just about beating him .
it &apos;s about whether he &apos;s right .
natasha !
natasha !
bruce ?
you all right ?
yeah .
the team is in the city . it &apos;s about to light up .
i don &apos;t suppose you found a key lying around somewhere .
yeah . i did .
so what &apos;s our play ?
i &apos;m here to get you to safety .
job &apos;s not finished .
we could help with the evacuation ,
but i can &apos;t be in a fight near civilians .
and you &apos;ve done plenty .
our fight is over .
so , we just disappear ?
come on .
your man &apos;s in the church , boss .
i think he &apos;s waiting for you .
come to confess your sins ?
i don &apos;t know . how much time you got ?
more than you .
have you been juicing ? little vibranium cocktail ?
you &apos;re looking ... i don &apos;t wanna say &quot; puffy . &quot;
you &apos;re stalling to protect the people .
well , that is the mission . did you forget ?
i &apos;ve moved beyond your mission . i &apos;m free .
what ?
you think you were the only one stalling ?
there &apos;s the rest of the vibranium .
function , still unclear .
this is how you end , tony .
this is peace in my time .
go !
get off the bridge !
run !
ultron .
my vision .
they really did take everything from me .
you set the terms . you can change them .
all right .
friday , the vision ?
boss , it &apos;s working .
he &apos;s burning ultron out of the net .
he won &apos;t escape through there .
you shut me out .
you think i care ?
you take away my world ,
i take away yours .
friday .
sokovia is going for a ride .
do you see
the beauty of it ?
the inevitability .
you rise , only to fall .
you , avengers , you are my meteor .
my swift and terrible sword .
and the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure .
purge me from your computers , turn my own flesh against me .
it means nothing .
when the dust settles ,
the only thing living in this world
will be metal .
we gotta move .
you &apos;re not gonna turn green ?
i &apos;ve got a compelling reason not to lose my cool .
i adore you .
but i need the other guy .
let &apos;s finish the job .
i really hope this makes us even .
now go be a hero .
the vibranium core &apos;s got a magnetic field .
that &apos;s what &apos;s keeping the rock together .
if it drops ?
right now , the impact will kill thousands .
once it gets high enough ? global extinction .
that building &apos;s not clear . the 10th floor .
okay .
get in the tub !
i got airborne , heading up to the bridge .
cap , you got incoming .
incoming already came in .
stark , you worry about bringing the city back down safely .
the rest of us have one job ,
tear these things apart .
you get hurt , hurt them back .
you get killed ,
walk it off .
go , go , go !
how could i let this happen ?
hey , hey , you okay ?
this is all our fault .
hey , look at me .
it &apos;s your fault , it &apos;s everyone &apos;s fault . who cares ?
are you up for this ?
are you ?
look , i just need to know . because the city is flying .
okay . look , the city is flying , we &apos;re fighting an army of robots ,
and i have a bow and arrow .
none of this makes sense .
but i &apos;m going back out there because it &apos;s my job .
okay ? and i can &apos;t do my job and babysit .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you did or what you were .
if you go out there , you fight , and you fight to kill .
stay in here , you &apos;re good .
i &apos;ll send your brother to come find you .
but if you step out that door ,
you are an avenger .
all right . good chat .
yeah , the city is flying .
i got you !
just look at me !
you can &apos;t save them all .
you &apos;ll never ...
&quot; never &quot; what ?
you didn &apos;t finish !
what , were you napping ?
thor .
you &apos;re bothering me .
all right , we &apos;re all clear here .
we are not clear !
we are very not clear !
all right , coming to you .
keep up , old man !
nobody would know .
nobody .
&quot; the last i saw him , an ultron was sitting on him .
&quot; yeah , he &apos;ll be missed , that quick little bastard .
&quot; i miss him already . &quot;
hold your fire !
romanoff !
thanks !
the anti @-@ gravs are rigged to flip .
touch them , they &apos;ll go full reverse thrust .
the city &apos;s not coming down slow .
spire is vibranium .
if i get thor to hit it ...
it will crack . that &apos;s not enough .
the impact would still be devastating .
maybe if we can cap the other end .
keep the atomic action doubling back .
that could vaporize the city .
and everyone on it .
the next wave is gonna hit any minute .
what do you got , stark ?
nothing great .
maybe a way to blow up the city .
that &apos;ll keep it from impacting the surface ,
if you guys can get clear .
i asked for a solution , not an escape plan .
impact radius is getting bigger every second .
we &apos;re gonna have to make a choice .
cap , these people are going nowhere .
if stark finds a way to blow this rock ...
not till everyone &apos;s safe .
everyone up here versus
everyone down there ? there &apos;s no math there .
i &apos;m not leaving this rock with one civilian on it .
i didn &apos;t say we should leave .
there &apos;s worse ways to go .
where else am i gonna get a view like this ?
glad you like the view , romanoff .
it &apos;s about to get better .
nice , right ?
pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends .
she &apos;s dusty , but she &apos;ll do .
fury , you son of a bitch .
you kiss your mother with that mouth ?
altitude is 18,000 and climbing .
lifeboats secure to deploy .
disengage in three , two ...
take them out .
this is s.h.i.e.l.d. ?
this is what s.h.i.e.l.d. is supposed to be .
this is not so bad .
let &apos;s load them up .
sir , we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank .
show &apos; em what we got .
you &apos;re up .
yes !
now this is gonna be a good story .
yup . if you live to tell it .
you think i can &apos;t hold my own ?
we get through this , i &apos;ll hold your own .
you had to make it weird .
i got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group .
here we go . here we go . let &apos;s move .
let &apos;s go , everyone !
number six boat is topped and locked ...
or stocked ... topped ...
it &apos;s full of people .
incoming !
oh , god !
you think you &apos;re saving anyone ?
i turn that key and drop this rock a little early
and it &apos;s still billions dead .
even you can &apos;t stop that .
i am thor , son of odin ,
and as long as there is life in my breast ...
i am running out of things to say !
are you ready ?
it &apos;s terribly well @-@ balanced .
well , if there &apos;s too much weight ,
you lose power on the swing , so ...
i got it . create a heat seal .
i could ...
i could supercharge the spire from below .
running numbers .
a heat seal could work with enough power .
thor , i got a plan .
we &apos;re out of time .
they &apos;re coming for the core .
rhodey , get the rest of the people on board that carrier .
on it .
avengers , time to work for a living .
are you good ?
yeah .
romanoff .
you and banner better not be playing &quot; hide the zucchini . &quot;
relax , shellhead .
not all of us can fly .
what &apos;s the drill ?
this is the drill .
if ultron gets a hand on the core , we lose .
is that the best you can do ?
you had to ask .
this is the best i can do .
this is exactly what i wanted .
all of you
against all of me .
how can you possibly hope to stop me ?
well , like the old man said ...
together .
you know , with the benefit of hindsight ...
they &apos;ll try to leave the city .
we can &apos;t let them , not even one . rhodey .
i &apos;m on it .
no . i didn &apos;t say you could leave .
war machine coming at you ! right ...
okay , what ?
we gotta move out . even i can tell the air is getting thin .
you guys get to the boats .
i &apos;ll sweep for stragglers . be right behind you .
what about the core ?
i &apos;ll protect it .
it &apos;s my job .
nat .
this way .
get the people on the boats .
i &apos;m not going to leave you here .
i can handle this .
come back for me when everyone else is off .
not before .
you understand ?
you know , i &apos;m 12 minutes older than you .
go .
boss , power levels are way below ...
reroute everything . we get one shot at this .
i know what i need to do .
the dining room .
if i knock out that east wall ,
it &apos;d make a nice workspace for laura , huh ?
put up some baffling .
she can &apos;t hear the kids running around . what do you think ?
you guys always eat in the kitchen anyway .
no one eats in a dining room .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
so get your ass on a boat .
hey , big guy .
sun &apos;s getting real low .
you &apos;re safe now . you &apos;re gonna be okay . buckle up .
secure your gear , find a seat .
costel !
we were in the market .
costel !
thor , i &apos;m gonna need you back in the church .
is this the last of them ?
yeah .
everyone else is on the carrier .
you know , this works ,
we maybe don &apos;t walk away .
maybe not .
i got no strings , so i have fun
i &apos;m not tied up to anyone .
come on . time to go .
you didn &apos;t see that coming ?
for god &apos;s sake .
zrinka !
costel ! baby !
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
fine .
it &apos;s been a long day .
wanda .
if you stay here , you &apos;ll die .
i just did .
do you know how it felt ?
it felt like that .
thor , on my mark .
now !
hey , big guy . we did it .
the job is finished .
now i need you to turn this bird around , okay ?
we can &apos;t track you in stealth mode .
so help me out . i need you ...
you &apos;re afraid .
of you ?
of death .
you &apos;re the last one .
you were supposed to be the last .
stark asked for a savior
and settled for a slave .
i suppose we are both disappointments .
i suppose we are .
humans are odd .
they think order and chaos are somehow opposites
and try to control what won &apos;t be .
but there is grace in their failings .
i think you missed that .
they &apos;re doomed .
yes .
but a thing isn &apos;t beautiful because it lasts .
it &apos;s a privilege to be among them .
you &apos;re unbearably naive .
well ...
i was born yesterday .
look ! say hi to auntie nat !
fat .
one of our tech boys flagged this .
splashed down in the banda sea .
could be the quinjet .
but with stark &apos;s stealth tech ,
we still can &apos;t track the damn thing .
right .
probably jumped out and swam to fiji .
he &apos;ll send a postcard .
&quot; wish you were here . &quot;
you sent me to recruit him way back when .
did you know then what was gonna happen ?
you never know .
you hope for the best , then make do with what you get .
i got a great team .
nothing lasts forever .
trouble , ms. romanoff .
no matter who wins or loses , trouble still comes around .
the rules have changed .
we &apos;re dealing with something new .
the vision is artificial intelligence .
a machine .
so , it doesn &apos;t count ?
no , it &apos;s not like a person lifting the hammer .
right , different rules for us .
nice guy . artificial .
thank you .
he can wield the hammer , he can keep the mind stone .
it &apos;s safe with the vision .
and these days , safe is in short supply .
but if you put the hammer in an elevator ...
it would still go up .
elevator &apos;s not worthy .
i &apos;m gonna miss these little talks of ours .
not if you don &apos;t leave .
i have no choice .
the mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones
to show up in the last few years .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
someone has been playing an intricate game
and has made pawns of us .
and once all these pieces are in position ...
triple yahtzee .
you think you can find out what &apos;s coming ?
i do .
besides this one ,
there &apos;s nothing that can &apos;t be explained .
that man has no regard for lawn maintenance .
i &apos;m gonna miss him , though . and you &apos;re gonna miss me .
there &apos;s gonna be a lot of manful tears .
i will miss you , tony .
yeah ?
well , it &apos;s time for me to tap out .
maybe i should take a page out of barton &apos;s book .
build pepper a farm , hope nobody blows it up .
the simple life .
you &apos;ll get there one day .
i don &apos;t know .
family , stability ...
the guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago .
i think someone else came out .
you all right ?
i &apos;m home .
you wanna keep staring at the wall , or do you wanna go to work ?
i mean , it &apos;s a pretty interesting wall .
i thought you and tony were still gazing into each other &apos;s eyes .
how do we look ?
well , we &apos;re not the &apos; 27 yankees .
we got some hitters .
they &apos;re good . they &apos;re not a team .
let &apos;s beat them into shape .
avengers ...
fine .
i &apos;ll do it myself .
