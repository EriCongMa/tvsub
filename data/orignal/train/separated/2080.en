What the hell? Watch out, man.
Chill out, buddy.
What the hell is wrong with this guy?
Sabrina, stay here.
Who is this guy?
Uh, sir?
I'm a doctor.
Are you all right?
Sir.
Max!
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
What's your problem, man?
Get off! Get off!
You see that guy?
Now, sir, back off! Come on!
I said back off!
He just bit that guy.
Trick or treat!
Okay.
Thank you! Mahalo.
What are you-- a dead butler?
Zombie butler.
Witchy-poo.
Happy Halloween.
Scary kid.
Thanks.
Your costume needs work.
Do you want some candy?
No, thanks.
Catherine, you can't keep doing this.
You got to stop punishing yourself for Billy's death.
Steve, please don't do this right now.
No, would you please just listen to me?
I've been here.
Okay? I promise you
I've been exactly where you are right now.
When you lose somebody like that,
you start second-guessing everything you did,
you start thinking about all the ways
that it could've been different.
You got to stop, okay?
I promise you, you do not want to carry that weight.
I'm not saying forget, Catherine.
I'm just saying you got to forgive yourself a bit, and-and...
give yourself a chance to move on.
I... I want to...
I want to.
I just don't know how.
My whole life was the Navy, Steve.
Knowing where I had to be every hour of every day.
What I had to do.
I had a purpose, and...
that's all gone now, so...
Right, that's why you got to find something, okay?
And it doesn't even have to be a job.
It doesn't matter what it is.
But you got to find something.
You putting your life on hold is not gonna bring Billy back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Duke, how's Sergeant Chang?
A little rattled.
But better than the other guy.
What do we know?
Some lunatic went nuts
and started attacking people.
Chang stepped in to intervene,
and the guy started choking him.
Took two shots to the shoulder
to put him down.
Any indication why the suspect wouldn't stand down?
Apparently he's unresponsive to Chang's orders.
Completely out of it.
We're still interviewing witnesses.
Okay. Mahalo.
All right, he's, uh... he's down.
How are you guys? All right?
Yeah, a little shaken, but we're okay.
Max, I hope that costume wasn't a rental.
Fortunately it's of my own design, Lieutenant.
In keeping the tradition
of Keanu-themed Halloween costumes,
I'm dressed as Siddhartha from the brilliant
but underrated 1993 film Little Buddha.
That is a lot of blood.
Yes, I don't think he's gonna make it.
That's provided he was even alive to begin with.
I'm sorry, I'm pretty sure I have
no idea what you're talking about.
I'm just saying the man showed
all the classic signs of zombiefication.
He was unresponsive,
had a labored gate.
And he lashed out violently
when he was confronted.
Wait, time-out.
Max, are you actually saying
that you think this man is a zombie?
I mean, he did bite a guy.
And he tried to bite Max while he was performing CPR.
Everything you just described
sounds like someone who was high on some very heavy drugs.
Well, perhaps your theory is more plausible, Lieutenant,
but as a man of science,
I have to consider all possibilities until...
...until proven...
Max?
Oh, God, it's happening.
What? What's happening?
Max.
I've been infected.
Max!
Trauma patient to E.R. 2.
I was the officer on scene.
One victim was shot twice.
The other collapsed in the field
after performing CPR on him.
Call ahead to the O.R.
and get our GSW prepped for surgery.
Run full labs on the other one.
This guy bit somebody and then attacked an officer.
It seems like he was under the influence of some sort of drug.
Sounds like PCP or bath salts.
Your friend may have been exposed while performing CPR.
I want everyone in protective gear while handling our GSW vic.
We don't need anybody out for the count tonight.
Oh, my God.
It's Michael.
Victim's name is Michael Besner.
He's the chief administrator of King's Medical Center.
Toxicology came back
with high levels of a powerful hallucinogen
called scopolamine.
He had traces of it around his nose and mouth.
Okay, that explains how Max was affected.
In places like Colombia, people use scopolamine
to drug and rob tourists.
It leaves its victims very docile
and very open to suggestion.
People can actually be sent up to their own hotel room,
empty their safe, and then wake up the next morning
with no memory of what happened.
Okay, wait a minute.
If this drug makes people easier to handle,
why did Besner here go off on a violent rampage?
Because it's highly dose-dependant.
You hit your victim with too much of it,
and they suffer a violent psychosis.
And given the fact that Besner was found
with no keys or wallet...
It's possible that he was drugged,
then robbed, then flew off the handle
as a result of being overdosed.
Right.
So, the good news is both he and Max are in stable condition,
but the bad news is whoever did this is still out there.
Okay, we need to retrace Besner's steps.
Work out how and where he was drugged tonight,
and if somebody
on the island is using scopolamine to rob people,
there could be other victims.
Max must be thrilled.
Pretty sure zombie attack's on his bucket list.
You're funny. Anyway, listen.
HPD went by Besner's place.
There was no sign of any break-in or any robbery.
But we tracked the GPS on his car.
It turned up on the other side of the island
like 15 miles away from his house.
Well, whoever robbed him probably dumped it there.
Right, anyway, it's a good place to start.
Why don't you pick me up on the way through?
Can I ask you a question?
How come we never take your truck?
My tr... Well...
the Camaro gets great gas mileage, Danny.
Yeah, it's gas mileage that I got to pay for.
Danny?
Everything all right?
Son of a bitch.
It's a violation, I mean,
any way you look at it, it's a violation.
The sanctity of my home has been violated.
It's toilet paper, Danny.
It's a couple of kids having fun on Halloween.
What's the big deal?
Well, the big deal is,
in my opinion, this is how most decent kids
turn to a life of corruption.
Excuse me?
Yeah, TP'ing is a gateway crime, okay?
It starts with toilet paper,
and then next is an armed robbery.
Okay, well...
you know what, Danny, if that's the case,
I really hope you catch these hardened criminals.
And I'm sure it's gonna be a career case for you.
Don't make fun.
I'm not making fun, buddy, I am serious.
Okay, which one's Besner's car?
This is the middle of nowhere.
What are all these doing here anyway?
Come on, baby, come over here.
豪华轿车
Boys, you guys going up to the party or what?
You gonna get an evidence bag
or are you gonna put that thing on?
You know what I never understood?
What it is about Halloween
that makes girls dress the way that they dress.
I mean, I am not complaining; I am grateful.
I'm just saying it's interesting.
You're grateful?
Yeah.
I'll remind you of that when Grace is a teenager.
Thank you.
Henry Upton, officers.
Welcome to my annual gala.
And don't worry, I have no intention of driving tonight.
Steve McGarrett,
Detective Danny Williams, Five-O.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Just wondering if you, uh... if you recognize this man.
Oh, yeah, of course. That's Michael Besner.
I sit on his hospital board.
Why, are you... are you looking for Michael?
Because I'm sure he's...
he's still around here somewhere.
Uh, no. Actually,
Mr. Upton, Michael's currently in the hospital
recovering from two gunshot wounds.
What?
Girls, mingle.
Don't go far.
What happened?
Well, uh, he, uh... he went a little crazy,
and he attacked some people, including a police officer.
No, no, no, that doesn't sound like Michael.
No, I'm sure it doesn't, sir,
but Mr. Besner had, uh, a drug called scopolamine
in his system.
It's-it's most commonly used to incapacitate and rob people.
His car is still here,
so we're thinking that, uh, someone drugged him
and kidnapped him from your party.
If it's okay with you,
we're gonna need a copy of your guest list.
Of course. Please, anything you need.
What about you? You working the door all night?
Yes, sir.
You see this guy leave?
Yeah, yeah. He left at about 9:00.
Looked like he had a few too many and, uh,
had to have a friend drive him home.
What did his friend look like?
Uh, dark clothes, scary mask.
That's about all I can remember.
Okay, Besner leaves here at 9:00 P.M., right?
Where was he the three hours
before he, uh... he got to the screening?
I don't know, I don't know.
But I think a better question is: Why take him?
I mean, you got rich people all over the place, right?
Right, right. Why target a hospital administrator?
Hold up. It's Chin. Chin, what do you got?
Looks we were off on the robbery angle.
Why? What do you mean?
I checked Besner's credit cards and bank accounts.
Both untouched. But get this:
His keycard was used at the hospital at 10:21 P.M.
Wait a minute. This entire thing
was about getting access to the hospital? Why?
I don't know.
But the keycard was only used in one place.
Where?
太平间
Down in the morgue.
Yeah, I've been here all night.
Only person who came in was my boss.
Your boss? You mean Michael Besner?
Yeah. It was weird.
He showed up around 10:00 p.M.
asking about the status of a body that came in.
Wanted to see the file.
Then he told me to go on break.
You see anybody with him?
No. But when I got back from my break,
he was gone and the file was still sitting there.
"Lisa Mills." Who is she?
Car accident.
Came in two days ago.
Where's the body?
Drawer seven. She's right here.
That's...
not right.
You gonna...?
No way, dude. That's all you.
Okay.
I don't suppose there's any chance she came in like this.
Um... no.
That's a very nice man-bag.
Perfect for a human head.
Besner walked right out of the hospital with it.
Check this out.
Black clothes, scary mask. I mean, he's gotta
be the guy who abducted Besner from the party.
Now look at this. This doesn't make sense to me: Why does he
drug him again after he already got what he wanted?
So Besner doesn't remember anything.
And also to buy himself some more time to get away.
Explains why Besner showed up at the screening
in the condition he was in.
That second dose must have sent him
into some sort of psychotic rage.
Yeah. What it doesn't explain is why somebody
would go through all that trouble
just to steal the head off a body.
The morgue attendant also said that Besner asked
for Lisa Mills specifically.
She wasn't chosen at random.
What do we know about her?
All right. Lisa Mills,
20-year-old local girl.
She died two days ago in a single-vehicle car accident.
But here's where it gets weird.
A little over a year ago, Lisa went missing.
They opened up an investigation.
No signs of foul play,
and there was no ransom demand ever made.
It was like this girl just vanished.
Then, 30 days after that,
she magically reappears.
She's discovered walking aimlessly along the Kam Highway.
She explain where she'd been?
Well, that's the thing-- she couldn't.
Lisa claims that she has no idea
of what happened to her or how long she was gone.
Now, HPD interviewed her, but what few facts
she was able to come up with
were sketchy at best.
So, what did they think,
that she kidnapped herself?
They didn't know what to think.
This girl has a juvenile record,
she's got a history of drug abuse,
but she passed a polygraph.
The best thing investigators could come up with
was that she suffered some sort of psychotic break.
Or maybe Lisa didn't remember what happened
because her memory of the events had been wiped.
Using scopolamine.
You're thinking that the guy who stole Lisa's head
was the same person that abducted her a year ago.
Look, you said it yourself, right?
She wasn't chosen at random.
Maybe the head was some kind of trophy.
That's a very dark theory, but I will buy it.
I'd also like to add that a girl dies in a car wreck
a year after she mysteriously goes missing
might not be an accident.
Let's have CSU process the car,
check for any signs of foul play.
In the meantime, we need to figure out
who was targeting her.
I'm really glad that you're okay.
I don't know what I would have done if I'd lost you.
Did-did you really think
it was a zombie apocalypse?
No.
But-but if there ever was one
and I'm bitten,
I would like you to kill me before I turn.
No chance!
I'm gonna make you bite me so that we can live forever
and eat brains and have zombie babies.
Hmm. Our first date was in a hospital.
Yeah. I still have that menu that you made
for the vending machine.
And the scar where I got shot.
Yeah, it's funny
how our relationship keeps circling back
to that intensive care ward.
Yeah, we might want to break that cycle.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Lieutenant, you need to see this.
What you got?
Chin, what do you got?
Just finished processing Lisa's car.
There's no sign of tampering,
but we found a wireless pinhole camera
hidden in the dashboard.
Somebody was spying on her?
Yeah, looks like it.
And whoever put it there made sure
it couldn't be traced.
Video stream's routed to an anonymous proxy.
You find anything in her apartment?
Let me call you back.
All right, so somebody planted cameras
in Lisa's car and her apartment.
Made sure they were untraceable.
That takes skill.
They also cut her head off of her body.
That takes a certain kind of crazy.
Look at this.
Good. Screening her calls.
Yeah.
We might have to trace those.
The signal is triangulating in this exact area.
He's gotta be around here someplace.
Crime lab.
Right.
Detective Williams.
Ooh, good.
Okay, what about fingerprints?
Okay, what about a brand name?
Okay, is it single-ply or two-ply?
Okay, well, thank you for nothing, okay?
Please call me if you find anything out Good-bye.
What?
You had them run the toilet paper from the tree, didn't you?
I am a victim of a crime, all right?
These punks, they vandalized my property. It's not right.
Congratulations, Danny.
You've just become an angry old man.
Oh, okay. Listen,
I may be angry, but I'm not old, okay?
All right, this is it. This is it right here.
Hold on.
Look at this.
Some kind of tunnel in here.
Hey, let's go.
No, I gotta...
I can't go. I can't do it. Sorry.
Can't do what?
I can't do, uh, caves or tunnels or, uh, cramped spaces.
Anything where I feel like a... like a rat. I can't.
You claustrophobic?
A little bit, yeah.
Okay.
Well, uh, wait here.
Okay. I'm sorry. I just... I can't.
No, it's... I mean, what are you gonna do, right?
Thanks.
Hey, Danny. Huh?
How'd it take me four years to learn that about you?
I don't know. Maybe you don't pay such close attention to me.
What's this?
FBI's forensic accounting files on the Yakuza.
Turns out Riku Sato's been laundering
a lot of money through Hawaii lately.
Where'd you get it?
A friend in the Bureau.
Does Steve know you're doing this?
No, not yet.
But I know that you've been trying to find out
where Sato's keeping Adam, and I want to help.
Okay. Tell me everything you know.
Check out these deposits here.
Okay, there's no way that Sato's running that kind of money
through Hawaii without having someone here to watch it.
So we identify that person, they lead us to Sato.
Something tells me
you already have an idea who that person is.
Right here.
Ryu Nabushi.
He's listed as an officer on three of these accounts.
Showed up in Hawaii right around the time
when the cash started flowing in.
Now, on paper, he's clean,
but I'm thinking that's a cover, so...
My best bet?
Nabushi is Sato's money man.
Catherine, thank you.
I promised Kono
I'd find Adam, and this is our best lead yet.
But I can't involve you beyond this.
Yes, you can.
Look... I lost Billy.
I'm not about to lose another friend.
Five-O!
Don't move! Hey!
What you doing? Hey. Hey.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Spit it out.
Spit it out.
Spit it out.
Spit it out. Spit it out right now.
He was trying to swallow this.
Oh, yeah?
That makes it evidence.
What do we got here?
Relax.
What?
What are you doing, carrying around
an article about Lisa Mills? Huh?
You know.
And if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.
On your knees.
On your knees. Come on.
On your knees.
You don't want to talk?
Maybe that explains all the hang-ups
on Lisa's answering machine.
I hung up 'cause I knew you were listening.
You think I'm dumb?
I don't know if you're dumb,
but you are definitely deranged.
Okay? To stalk a woman,
and then mutilate her corpse...
there's got to be something very wrong with you.
What?
No, no, no, no.
No, no... are you saying Lisa's dead?
Yes.
No.
Yeah, that's what he's saying. Hey. That's what he's saying.
She died in a car accident two days ago.
And you know what somebody did last night?
No.
Somebody broke into the hospital morgue,
and they cut the head off Lisa's body.
You know anything about that?
No.
Do you know anything about that?
No, no, no, no.
I didn't do that! I didn't do that!
All I did was call her.
I just wanted to call her so I could tell her that...
Tell her what?
Tell her what?
Okay, listen. Listen to me.
Lisa may be gone, but we're here to help.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You can tell us, okay?
What... what'd you want to tell her?
I... I wanted to tell her
that I read what happened to her...
and that the same thing happened to me.
Wait, you were abducted, too?
Two years, three months and 11 days ago,
they came and took me away,
and they did things to my head.
And then they tried to erase what they did,
but... but I still remember things like...
like the lights and the voices
and-and the way the place looked, and...
That's why... that's why they put cameras in my walls
and tapped my phone.
Because they want to find out how much I know.
Did you say that they put cameras in your walls?
In the air conditioner and behind the mirror.
Th-That's why I had to go underground,
because it's the only place they can't see me.
Who's "They"?
Who abducted you?
I-I don't know.
I don't know who they are,
but I know they're everywhere.
And they're listening and they're watching.
And they even tried to steal my thoughts once.
But I took care of that.
So the guy's name is Marshall Demps.
ER records show that he was brought into the hospital
with a self-inflicted incision on the back of his head.
He told doctors there was an implant in his brain.
Huh. Was there?
No, but they did find something odd
when they ran a MRI.
As you can see, the imaging shows
a number of highly localized histopathological lesions
and T. Gondii cysts
on the corpus amygdaloideum section of the medial temporal lobe.
Okay.
This part of the brain is called the amygdala.
Mr. Demps' amygdala is covered with cysts.
That's weird.
How weird?
Well, we only see it in severe cases of toxoplasmosis.
That's an infection due to the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
Once it enters the host's system,
it migrates to the amygdala, forming cysts.
So Demps was infected?
Yes. Intentionally.
What do you mean, "Intentionally"?
Well, I autopsied Lisa Mills' body
as well as drew blood from Mr. Demps'.
What I found was that they both had
an extremely virulent strains
of Toxoplasma gondii in their system.
In fact, their levels were so high
that the only possible explanation
could be that the parasites were injected directly.
So both of these victims were abducted
and injected with this parasite that affected their brains.
And then they were released,
so they could be spied on and observed. Right?
Somebody's been conducting human experiments.
Okay, Lisa.
Let's start again from the beginning, okay?
What happened on the night of July 6, 2012?
I was walking home
when someone came up behind me.
They put something over my mouth...
and everything went black.
I passed out.
And for a long time,
it was dark.
But then a light turned on.
It was so bright.
I tried to move, but I couldn't.
My hands and legs were in restraints.
I heard footsteps.
And then someone was standing over me.
I couldn't see his face.
But I remember his voice.
And what did he say?
He told me to relax.
That everything was going to be okay.
Then what happened?
Then I felt like a pinch in my arm,
like somebody was drawing blood...
He injected me with something.
So we got two people abducted
a year apart from each other,
both of whom were used as subjects in a human experiment.
Okay, well, if we can figure out
how and why they were selected,
it might help us identify who took them.
Let's start with Marshall Demps.
He spent most of his life
in and out of shelters, foster homes.
If you're gonna go snatch somebody off the street,
maybe better somebody that won't be missed. Right.
Yes, but Lisa Mills was living with her parents
at the time she was abducted.
So it looks like the only thing
these two had in common
was that they both had juvenile records.
Actually, that's not the only thing
they have in common.
It turns out that both victims had MRIs ordered
when they were children.
Lisa had hers when she was 12,
and Demps, for a concussion he suffered
following a fight when he was 16.
In both cases, imaging shows
a smaller than average amygdala.
Which is significant,
because children who exhibit antisocial
and aggressive behavior have, on average,
an 18% reduction
in that section of the brain.
Okay, wait a minute. You're saying that
somebody's trying to reform troubled kids
by messing with their brain?
Yes.
And I think I know who it is.
Oh, he's been waiting for this for a very long time.
Gentlemen, this video is from
a psychiatric convention
in Dallas from three years ago.
We don't need more prisons.
What we need is more science.
The criminal mind can be cured.
And I believe I know how to do it.
The gentleman speaking is Dr. William Ellery.
He is the holder of PhDs
in both criminal psychology and neuroscience.
Dr. Ellery published
numerous articles detailing his theory
on how criminal behavior can be adjusted
by targeting the amygdala.
Then, a couple years ago,
his work suddenly stopped.
Why?
Last I heard,
Dr. Ellery had left his research post.
He's here.
He was granted a Hawaii medical license
back in May of 2011.
Wait a minute. That's just a couple of months
before Marshall Demps was abducted.
Clear.
Clear. Clear.
He's not here.
No signs of any sort of lab, either.
All right, let's put an APB out on Ellery,
get CSU over here to tear this place apart.
Yes, of course.
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Can you hold it?
Please forgive my associates.
They seem to have lost their manners.
Thank you.
Uh, 25, please.
How's the water today?
Perfect.
You and your associates
forget your bathing suits upstairs?
No.
Unfortunately, we're here on business.
Don't work too hard.
You'll make me feel guilty about all the fun I'm having.
We wouldn't want that, would we?
No.
So it took a little while,
but I was able to bypass the security on Ellery's computer.
Take a look at this.
I found out that Ellery was using
his doctor privileges to log into imaging centers
all across Hawaii.
In the past year alone,
he's viewed thousands of MRIs.
He's screening for test subjects.
Exactly.
But he only saved three scans.
Lisa's, Marshall's,
and the third subject's name is Brock Upton.
Wait a minute. Upton.
That sound familiar to you?
Yeah, at the party last night.
The guy who threw the party, Henry Upton.
I gotta tell you, for a 22-year-old, your boy's
got a pretty impressive number of arrests on his record.
All right, what did Brock do this time?
Oh, he didn't do anything.
You, you're the one who's got some explaining to do.
Look, we know you're bankrolling
Ellery's medical practice, all right?
We also know you brought Ellery out here
to Hawaii to rehabilitate your son.
Where's Brock?
All right, HPD went to his house,
he wasn't there. Where is he?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Where's the kid?
You tell me.
Where's the kid.
All right, look, I sent my son to all the right boarding schools,
I got him the psychologists,
I got him all the right medications.
Nothing worked!
Then I read about Dr. Ellery's work.
He said the science was sound,
but he couldn't develop the procedure
because nobody would allow him to conduct human trials.
So I wrote him a blank check,
and all I said was, "Please...
please fix my son."
What would you have done if it was your kid?
Me? I don't know. I don't know.
But I definitely would not let some wack job
inject parasites into his body.
Yeah, well, the idea of injecting children
with viral antigens was once considered controversial.
But without inoculations,
we'd still have polio,
we'd still have smallpox.
Bold breakthroughs take risk.
Right, right. As long as those risks
are to other people's kids.
I mean, you let this guy use other people as guinea pigs
to iron out the kinks.
Two lives have been ruined, okay?
You're complicit in both of those.
You understand that?
Not to mention luring Michael Besner to this house
so Ellery could have access to Lisa's body.
It's unfortunate what happened to Michael, all right?
But we put a lot of money into that girl.
Dr. Ellery needed to take a look at her brain
to make sure there weren't any complications
from the procedure, and there weren't.
She was cured. And now he's gonna cure my son.
Is that what he told you?
Yeah.
Okay, let's take a look at this.
This is a video that I pulled off his computer.
Take a look at that. You recognize her? That's Lisa.
Dr. Ellery lied to you, okay?
She had a cyst that ruptured in her brain,
causing her to lose consciousness.
That's why she died.
Is this the kind of cure you want for your son?
Oh, my god.
What have I done?
Where's Brock?
Dr. Ellery phoned me just a little bit ago.
He said it was time.
Time for what?
He's doing the procedure right now.
Relax.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Please, you gotta save my son!
I think we got the right place.
Clear.
Looks like the good doctor didn't get to finish the job.
Hey. Brock!
Brock!
Brock, it's all right.
Easy. Take it easy.
I got you, buddy, okay?
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
You'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Brock.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry.
Grace!
When you finish a roll of toilet paper,
you gotta replace it, okay?
You know where the toilet paper is, don't you?
Where's, uh... where's all the toilet paper, Grace?
Come on.
I don't get it, Grace.
I don't understand.
Why would you do this to your own house, huh?
I don't know.
Excuse me?
I don't know.
No, that's not an answer.
Well, it's just...
my friends dared me to do it,
and I thought it would be better
to do it to my house than someone else's.
Someone else's house would be mean.
Okay, uh...
if ever again one of your friends or you
decide you want to vandalize somebody's property,
I want you to call me immediately.
Understand me?
Yes, Danno.
Hey, look at me.
You call me. Call me right away.
I can always take you to Uncle Steve's, all right?
Okay.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
So, Nabushi's real name is Hideaki Kuroda.
He's a Yakuza lieutenant with deep ties to Sato.
How deep?
Deep enough that he could lead us to him.
We find Sato, we find Adam.
Exactly.
Where'd you get all this?
Thought you could use some dinner.
Thanks.
Looks like you've been busy.
Just, uh, taking your advice.
