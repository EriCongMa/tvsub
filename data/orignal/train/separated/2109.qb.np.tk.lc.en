who &apos;s that ?
come on , get out the water .
look out ! hey behind you !
get the shore !
aaron , that wasn &apos;t funny .
you &apos;re the only one who isn &apos;t laughing .
the lifeguards are going to kick you off the beach
if they see you .
yeah , whatever , liz .
we &apos;re in hawaii .
they have real sharks here , you idiot .
i &apos;m off to claim my next victim .
okay , fellas , grand opening is next week .
you get to taste test my menu items .
today we got shrimp jambalaya , shrimp and grits ,
shrimp pupu , shrimp kabobs , shrimp fried rice .
and for the keiki &apos;s , my classic corn @-@ battered shrimp on a stick .
okay , you know why shrimp trucks are so popular ?
is because people know what they &apos;re going to get
when they go to one-- they &apos;re going to get
garlic scampi , hot and spicy , lemon and butter .
three flavors , not 31 .
but this island is crawling with competition , man .
a diverse menu can only make my product stand out
in an oversaturated market .
now dig in to the grinds , and tell me what you think , please .
jambalaya has got some kick . try it .
you know what ?
you got a cast @-@ iron stomach ,
but that should be weaponized . you got any water in there ?
sparkling or flat ?
seriously , i can &apos;t breathe right now .
anything .
coming right up .
man .
i know you didn &apos;t call me here just for lunch .
so , what &apos;s on your mind , son ?
i need to know why my father was meeting
with wo fat and governor jameson .
okay ? i need to know what was being discussed on that video .
i told you i got the dod working on extracting the sound .
but it &apos;s not an easy job , the audio was scrubbed .
it &apos;s been four weeks .
yeah , well , it &apos;s the dod , son .
nothing happens overnight .
who &apos;s your guy in digital forensics ? i &apos;ll give him a call .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
just give me some more time on this .
we &apos;ll have some answers soon enough .
mcgarrett .
what &apos;s cooking , max ?
one right hand of a john doe murder vic .
approximately 30 to 40 years old .
where &apos;s the rest of him ?
the coast guard is dragging
the shorelines of waikiki beach where the hand was found .
why are we tagging this guy a homicide ?
this guy-- it &apos;s a hand . he could be shark food .
blood had elevated levels of lead ,
indicating the victim was indeed shot .
the hand was then severed postmortem
by something sharp enough to cut through a bone .
most likely a boat rotor cut through a body dump .
all right , what are you doing ?
we &apos;re dealing with a wet body , so after 24 hours of submersion ,
the skin separates from the dermis .
try to roll a print and you only get a black smudge .
but the outer layer of the skin actually maintains its ridging .
all you need is an extra set of hands and you &apos;re in business .
you &apos;re putting the guy &apos;s hand like it &apos;s a glove .
max , that &apos;s disgusting .
yes , but very effective .
sweet . we got a hit .
the victim &apos;s name is blake spencer .
okay , got a local address ?
sir , we &apos;re told blake spencer lives here ?
sure , it &apos;s the apartment above the bar . why ?
blake spencer was found murdered this morning .
murdered ? i don &apos;t get it .
he was such a good kid .
how well did you know blake ?
blake was a lot more than just a renter .
i considered him a friend . you see that cutlass ?
that &apos;s royal navy .
blake got it off an 18th century british schooner
that sank off the antilles .
he gave it to me as a thanks for
not going after him for back rent .
so blake was a diver ?
damn good one . best salvage diver
who ever walked though my door .
salvage diving .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s dangerous work .
lucrative , too .
blake found wreck sites all over the world .
had collectors lining up to buy from him .
so why &apos;s he living in an apartment above a bar ?
he moved back to hawaii after his mom got sick .
had to put her in a rest home near waipahu .
you know , that didn &apos;t keep him out of the water though .
from what i could tell he was going after a new wreck .
he tell you what it was ?
nah .
but if blake was interested in it , it had to be something big .
here you go .
thank you .
thanks .
i &apos;ll be downstairs if you need me .
lovely place .
i &apos;ll get lori to track down the mother .
all right , what &apos;s missing here ?
oh , besides a box spring ,
a television , anywhere to sit , i have no idea .
blake traveled the world diving shipwrecks ,
looking for hidden treasure .
don &apos;t you think he would have kept something ?
he &apos;s got a sick mother to support .
maybe he had to sell everything .
or he was sinking everything into his next treasure hunt .
guy maxed out his credit card on boat and equipment rentals .
12 grand alone last month .
you know , this is generally
not the kind of reading material you find under a mattress .
looks like codes and stuff .
i bet they &apos;re navigational coordinates .
blake probably encoded them to protect his dive sites .
a lot of trouble to go through . must be something pretty valuable .
you hear that ? listen .
you know , the treasure blake was looking for--
looks like he already found it .
yeah , and it might have got him killed .
excuse me , mrs. spencer ,
i &apos;m officer lori weston .
is it okay if i come in and talk to you ?
please , come in .
can i get you something to drink ?
or eat ?
no , thank you .
i have a sandwich here .
my son likes one when he comes home .
your son ? you mean blake ?
yes .
he should be home any minute .
he &apos;s always so hungry after school .
blake &apos;s still in school ?
sixth grade now .
his teachers say he &apos;s one of the smartest in his class .
do you have children ?
no , ma &apos;am . i don &apos;t .
well , you have plenty of time for that .
did you say you wanted to talk to me about something ?
is something wrong , dear ?
it &apos;s amazing .
i mean , one day you are the king of the ocean , right ?
the next thing you know , you &apos;re hanging from the ceiling in a museum
and children are looking at your private parts .
yep , kind of puts things in perspective .
excuse me . five @-@ o , right ?
you called about the coins ?
yeah , i &apos;m steve mcgarrett ,
this is detective williams .
danny , please .
hi . dr. gabrielle asano .
i &apos;m the museum &apos;s curator of historic and cultural affairs .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
nice to meet you .
very nice to meet you .
danny .
huh ?
the coins ?
oh , sorry . um ...
have ... you ever seen anything like this ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
as a matter of fact ... i have .
the princesa del mar was a spanish trade galleon
lost at sea in 1682,
after it came under cannon fire from english pirates .
these coins are from that wreck .
spanish galleon ? is it possible
that something like that could have sunk in local waters ?
absolutely .
the galleon &apos;s believed to have diverted here
for repairs after the pirate attack .
salvage divers have been looking for the wreck for years .
right , so what you &apos;re saying is ,
whoever recovered these coins
may actually have found the princesa ?
pirate ships and cannonballs and treasure .
i thought this stuff only happened in movies .
i can assure you the treasure is very real .
and very valuable .
valuable ? how , uh , how much are we talking about ?
on the collectible market , the coins would fetch
maybe a couple thousand ... ... each .
and the princesa was believed
to be carrying several tons of them .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
that &apos;s a lot of motive .
gentlemen , would you mind
if i held on to these for a while ?
on behalf of the museum , i &apos;d like to authenticate them .
i &apos;m sorry , but these coins
are actually evidence in a murder investigation .
yeah , but ...
i &apos;m thinking it won &apos;t hurt to just give her one little coin .
go ahead . it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just one coin .
why are you losing your mind ?
i &apos;m not losing my mind .
if you want to ask her out , ask her out . i &apos;m just saying .
who said anything about asking her out ?
come on . you left dr. asano a coin ,
so you have a reason to go back and see her . it &apos;s fine .
uh , that &apos;s not true .
i left her a coin because she might
be able to help with our investigation .
really ? you know what you should do ?
you should ask her out for coffee .
i don &apos;t want ... i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not looking for a relationship .
coffee &apos;s not a relationship . it &apos;s a beverage .
that &apos;s not true . every single relationship
starts with a cup of coffee .
then it &apos;s dinner and a movie . okay ?
next thing you know , you &apos;re divorced ,
you &apos;re moving to hawaii
so you can see your daughter every other weekend .
you need to talk to somebody professionally . okay ?
i do . you . and now the session &apos;s over .
no , the session &apos;s not over , danny .
you need to get back on the horse ,
and a cup of coffee &apos;s a good place to start .
what are we doing ?
i need to make a stop . just wait here .
hi , cath .
thank you for meeting me .
yeah .
got that for you .
oh , look at that . thank you .
what do you need this time ?
what do you make of this ?
our victim was a wreck diver , and we think
that he may have been killed at one of his dive sites .
okay , well , if you &apos;re right about these being coordinates ,
then the cipher should be easy to crack .
i &apos;ll run cryptography and let you know what i find .
mahalo .
see , this is usually the part where , you know ,
you ask me out to dinner as a thank you .
oh , no ... absolutely . anywhere you want , okay ?
but before you decide , i , uh ...
i need to ask you one more favor .
sasabune , omakase menu .
now , what &apos;s the favor ?
fine . um ...
you remember joe white ?
your old commander ?
yeah .
yeah , yeah . uh , i heard he &apos;s overseeing
seal team training at pearl now .
yeah , he is . uh ...
look , he submitted a piece of intel for analysis , okay ?
it &apos;s a video i &apos;m trying to pull sound from .
dod has been sitting on it for weeks now .
i just ... i was hoping you could check the status for me .
look , if the request came from joe ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s being handled .
could you just check for me , please ?
do you think someone at dod is giving you the runaround ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
yeah . okay .
good timing .
the coast guard just recovered
the rest of blake spencer &apos;s body at sea .
max found traces of helium in the lung tissue .
so we know blake was killed right after a mixed gas dive ,
which means deep water .
exactly .
and check this out .
he still had his dive bag on him .
what is that ? there &apos;s something in there .
i had everything sent to the crime lab for analysis .
i &apos;m heading over there now . hopefully , whatever &apos;s
inside that bag could lead us to our killer .
good .
hey . did you get anything from the mother ?
not exactly .
how &apos;d she take it ?
i didn &apos;t tell her .
what ? what are you talking about ?
why not ?
the woman &apos;s suffering from alzheimer &apos;s .
she thinks blake &apos;s 11 years old .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;d be able to process it .
uh , how &apos;d the museum work out ?
how &apos;d it go , danny ? how was the museum ?
enough , okay ? turns out that our victim uncovered a major shipwreck .
so we &apos;re thinking that somebody got hip to what he was doing ,
followed him out to the site and killed him .
we need to find out who else knew about that treasure .
an old wallet ?
it &apos;s the only thing i found in the dive bag .
and last i checked , 17th century pirates
didn &apos;t carry leather wallets made in new york city .
right . so it belonged to blake ?
i don &apos;t think so . but based on the oxidation ,
i &apos;d say this thing was submerged for at least 50 years .
i may be able to date it more accurately
once i &apos;m done processing these .
wow , there was money inside it .
the wallet prevented the bills from deteriorating completely ,
but the ink is mostly gone .
either way , he didn &apos;t get this off the princesa .
all right , so he could have been diving
another wreck when he was killed .
i &apos;ll let you know when i &apos;m done processing .
yeah , thanks , charlie .
hey . um , i need a favor .
this is my activity log for the hpd database .
the login that &apos;s circled here
was made from an ip address that i don &apos;t recognize .
now , i managed to back @-@ trace it
through a couple of proxies , but i can &apos;t get past a vpn .
can you help ?
chin , if someone hacked into your account ,
you need to notify the department .
i will-- if the threat &apos;s legit .
okay . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
thanks .
thanks for the beer .
thanks for nothing .
can i buy you a drink ?
seen you making the rounds . you a cop ?
mm @-@ hmm . lori weston , five @-@ o.
jimmy koller .
nice to meet you , jimmy koller .
well , that &apos;s an interesting ring .
what is that , white gold or something ?
oxidized silver .
got it off the hms pegasus .
right . thought you might be a diver .
you ... by any chance , you know a blake spencer ?
as well as the next guy .
blake mostly kept to himself , but i heard he was a real pro .
you hear anything about him diving the princesa del mar ?
no . but i know a guy who &apos;s been hunting the princesa for years .
sunk a lot of money into finding her , too .
and who might that be ?
i &apos;m jesse billings , president of voyager marine ,
the world leader in deep water shipwreck exploration .
today , i &apos;m going to offer you a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity
to invest in what just may be the greatest treasure hunt of all time .
for the past two years , billings has been pitching investors
on the hunt for the princesa .
he &apos;s already sold millions in shares .
which means he had a lot to lose if someone found
the wreck before he did .
at voyager marine ,
this is detective williams .
our world @-@ class team of researchers , technicians and divers
search the oceans for treasures once thought lost forever .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get-- with all the resources
that jesse had , how was blake able to beat him to the princesa ?
that &apos;s how . that &apos;s our dead diver .
blake worked for jesse billings .
so he didn &apos;t discover the princesa ;
he stole the coins from his boss .
yeah , and you know what ? i bet jesse was pretty upset
when he found out about it .
thank you .
um , only one problem with that theory .
just got off the phone with dr. asano from the bishop museum .
the coins we found in blake &apos;s apartment are fake .
you think i killed blake spencer .
he &apos;s a mind reader .
yes , that &apos;s what we think .
why would i kill my best diver ?
i &apos;ll tell you why-- because blake found out
that the treasure hunt you hired him for was a scam .
why don &apos;t you take a look at this photo ?
where did you get these ?
we found those in blake &apos;s apartment .
those coins are about as real as your tan .
you know what ? i bet you haven &apos;t even dipped a toe
in the water in years .
but i have to commend you on a somewhat elaborate scam .
it &apos;s pretty good-- you dump a bunch of fake coins in the ocean
to convince your investors that you have found the princesa del mar.
but you didn &apos;t find the princesa , did you ?
and blake realized the coins were fakes ,
and that &apos;s why he took them .
and you knew he was going to open his mouth about it ,
so you had to kill him .
i &apos;ve , uh ...
i &apos;ve salted a few shipwrecks--
i admit that
but i had no idea blake knew it . i swear .
got some news on those bills .
great .
what is it ?
i traced that ip address you gave me .
that login was made from a home computer .
okay . do we know the owner ?
yeah . it was kono .
kono was dismissed from the force .
what &apos;s she doing using your password to access hpd files ?
you know what ? that was me .
i was at kono &apos;s house that day .
i used her computer to check up on some case work .
thanks .
right .
so what do we know about those bills ?
took some work , but i was able to piece together one of them .
what is that , a five ?
good eye .
it &apos;s pretty faded , but there &apos;s still some ink there .
and wait till you see this .
the hawaiian overprint note , issued in 1942 .
after pearl harbor , the decision was made
to pull all the paper money on the islands and destroy it ,
replacing it with this .
why ?
because , had the japanese invaded hawaii , they would have
been able to seize huge sums of u.s. currency .
by this way , the federal reserve just declares
the hawaii @-@ stamped bills worthless . problem solved .
of course , the invasion never happened .
when the war ended ,
the overprint notes were recalled .
okay . how did blake get this ?
not from the princesa .
he must have been diving another wreck .
if that wallet was underwater for 50 years ,
he may have been salvaging a ship that sunk during world war ii .
okay , hang on a second . catherine decrypted
the coordinates from blake &apos;s notebook .
look where they fall .
it &apos;s a straight line from oahu to maui .
his wreck must have sunk along a ferry or shipping route .
that &apos;s a lot of ground to cover .
and blake could have been killed at any one of these sites .
i may know how to find which one .
according to blake &apos;s credit card company ,
he rented one of your salvage boats .
yeah . most of my business is wreck divers .
blake wasn &apos;t due back until tomorrow .
did he say where he planned on diving ?
i didn &apos;t ask ,
and he wouldn &apos;t have told me if i had .
blake didn &apos;t talk to anybody about his work .
mr. julian , that boat is now a crime scene ,
so you think you can help us find where it is ?
all my rentals are equipped with tracking systems .
just a second . i &apos;ll pull it up .
ok , perfect .
great .
is there a problem ?
transponder on his boat isn &apos;t working .
must be busted .
or blake disabled it because he didn &apos;t want
anyone following his to his dive site .
okay , listen to me . give me the tags and a description the boat .
okay , if blake &apos;s killers haven &apos;t sunk the boat ,
it &apos;s got to still be out there somewhere , right ?
6588 , sector honolulu .
request op and position .
sector honolulu , 6588,
operations normal , position 21 degrees , 45.3 minutes north ,
157 degrees , 25.4 minutes west ,
one plus one zero minutes to bingo .
continuing parallel search for the overdue vessel .
so let me ask you a question .
if a woman leaves the relationship status
on her profile page empty , does that generally mean
that she is single or that she is taken ?
is this about the hot doctor from the museum ?
you should ask her out .
what , he ... he talked to you about this ?
what , are we in high school ?
no , we &apos;re not , but ...
hey , guys .
coast guard just called .
they found blake &apos;s boat 40 miles east of oahu .
pilot says it is not moving with the currents .
ooh ! even i know what that means .
means the boat is anchored .
that &apos;s right .
so the site blake was diving must be right below it .
yeah , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
those are deep waters .
you &apos;d be crazy to dive that by yourself .
yeah , i would . that &apos;s why i &apos;m taking a partner .
partner ?
steve , glad you called .
chin , it &apos;s not a good time .
i want to know why you were using
my password to access hpd records .
i wanted to see my case file .
why ?
&apos;cause i want to know what they have on me .
see if there &apos;s any chance of me ever getting my badge back .
you could have just asked me .
you just get reinstated a month ago .
last thing i want to do is cause you any trouble .
you shouldn &apos;t even be here .
what the hell is he doing here ?
lieutenant kelly .
it &apos;s nice to see you got your badge back .
yeah , some of us , we weren &apos;t so lucky .
you got ten seconds to turn around
and go back to your car , ray .
you want me to leave , kono ?
no .
bye @-@ bye .
good ol &apos; cousin chin .
he &apos;s back with five @-@ o , that right ?
yeah .
and , uh , you used his password to get me those hpd files ?
i can &apos;t decide whether that was really resourceful ...
or incredibly stupid .
look , frank ,
you came to me for access , i got you access .
chin won &apos;t be a problem . i &apos;ll make sure of it .
you better .
your cousin starts poking his nose where it doesn &apos;t belong ,
that &apos;s gonna be a problem for all of us .
i might not handle it as delicately as you .
we got blood .
gunshot spatter and a pool here
where blake must have dropped .
why right here ? right ?
could have set up while blake was diving ,
and popped him right when he got out of the water .
got a slug here . nine mil .
all right , check out this trajectory .
shooter had to be on the boat for this to line up .
which means he either forced his way on or ...
or blake trusted him enough to have him on board .
so , uh , you hear anything back
from the dod about that surveillance video yet ?
still no word .
what ?
i just can &apos;t shake this feeling
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me , joe . that &apos;s all .
well try harder &apos; cause when we break 150 feet
and the narcosis sets in , you &apos;re gonna have
enough trouble keeping your head straight without those thoughts
bouncing around in it . understand ?
yeah .
okay . i splash first .
we &apos;re gonna follow the anchor line down .
stay close , stay focused .
now let &apos;s go see what blake found .
yes . sir .
max , you need a hand ?
oh , thank you ,
but it is against protocol
for anyone but the me to handle the remains .
no , no , i don &apos;t want to help .
there &apos;s actually a hand right there if you want , if you need a hand .
ah , that was very humorous .
hey , guys , so the car is a late 1930 &apos;s
packard model ambulance , military issue .
so , this guy could have been a soldier ?
i don &apos;t know . max ?
well , i can &apos;t answer that .
but i can tell you that we have a full skeleton here .
it &apos;s male , roughly six feet tall .
as for the cod , well , it wasn &apos;t anything nefarious .
just a few broken bones .
any chance we can get an id on him ?
teeth are intact , however , if he is as old as the car
that we found him in , then most likely
we don &apos;t have dental records that go that far back .
so id &apos;ing him would be a long shot .
we could always take him to jpac .
they got x @-@ rays and records
going all the way back to the &apos; 30s .
so if this guy served , he &apos;s probably in the system .
let &apos;s hope so . blake died salvaging this car .
we need to find out why it was worth killing for .
okay . bag him up , kid . you &apos;re going with .
yes !
did you know that jpac
is the largest forensic lab in the world ,
and that it specializes exclusively
in postmortem identification ?
which , incidentally , is my favorite type of identification .
you need a paper bag or something ?
huh ? oh , sorry .
it &apos;s just this place is like my graceland .
okay .
but no souvenirs .
gentlemen .
hi , i &apos;m dr. tallridge .
scientific director .
joe white .
max bergman .
max , welcome to jpac .
um , why don &apos;t we find a lab table
and see what you got here .
all right , i researched archives
for the advertiser and the maui news .
went all the way back to 1938 .
no articles mentioning anything about a car lost at sea .
i found something with naval history and heritage command .
these guys , they keep records
of every incident report ever filed .
this was dated july 19 , 1942 .
a navy transport vessel was delivering supplies
to maui when a big storm hit ,
sending some of the cargo overboard .
including a 1939 army ambulance .
you found it .
i did find it , but it doesn &apos;t explain why
blake was salvaging that car . i don &apos;t get it .
maybe there &apos;s something valuable inside .
no , i mean , according to this report ,
the ambulance was transporting a body for burial .
the deceased was a captain robert s. murphy .
you think those were his remains inside ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , there were bones in the front seat .
there was no casket in the back .
wait a minute .
i &apos;ve seen this guy before .
i was just a little girl when my father died .
we were living in maui , he was stationed at pearl .
after the attack ,
it took a few days until we heard that he &apos;d been killed .
dad was supposed to have been buried
in the family plot , but ...
but he never made it home .
not knowing where he was , it always haunted my mother .
haunted the rest of us , too .
mrs. spencer , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so very sorry .
no family should ever have to suffer through something like that .
you &apos;ve served , haven &apos;t you ?
yes , ma &apos;am , navy .
i can tell .
you have that look about you .
my son blake wants to be a sailor when he grows up .
i can &apos;t keep that boy out of the water .
mrs. spencer ...
... about blake ...
mrs. spencer , thank you .
we &apos;ll , uh , we &apos;ll be on our way .
but she still doesn &apos;t know about blake .
better to tell her when we have answers .
he was looking for his grandfather .
that &apos;s why finding that ambulance
was so important to him .
he wanted to give his mother some closure
by finally bringing home the body .
yeah , i understand why it was important to blake ,
but why would somebody kill him for it ?
joe , go ahead .
steve , we got a match on those remains .
all right , did it come back to a captain robert murphy ?
no . docs id &apos;d our man
as private miles brodic .
he served with the 27th infantry out of schofield .
beyond that , i can &apos;t tell you much about him
because his file has been classified for nearly 70 years .
well , let &apos;s get it declassified .
a few months into his enlistment ,
private miles brodic faced a court @-@ martial
on multiple charges of petty theft .
he was dishonorably discharged in may of &apos; 41 .
after his discharge ,
brodic took a job at kealani cemetery .
he was there when the bombs dropped on pearl .
he was also there when the government issued
the order to recall all the paper money
on the islands and replace it with the hawaiian overprint note .
sorry , i don &apos;t understand .
lori , kealani cemetery
is where all the recalled money was sent to be destroyed .
they burned over a hundred million dollars
of it at the crematorium there .
actually , not all the money was destroyed .
according to the military ,
2 million was siphoned off by someone with inside access .
brodic .
by the time the mps got wind of it , brodic was long gone .
anybody want to guess how he snuck the loot off the island ?
robert murphy &apos;s casket .
brodic knew it was going to maui ,
so he stashed his money inside of it .
explains why somebody would shoot blake over it .
that money is still valid currency .
so we find that casket , we find our killer .
anybody want some shrimp mochi for dessert ?
that &apos;s , uh , shrimp- flavored ice cream ?
mm @-@ hmm .
huh , that &apos;s , that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;m full .
yeah , i &apos;m good , too , but thank you .
shoots .
i &apos;ll just leave the bill .
i &apos;ll settle up with the big man .
thanks , joe .
you guys are gonna want to see this .
you remember remo julian ?
yeah . isn &apos;t that the charter operator
that blake rented his boat from ?
mm . he &apos;s also a very accomplished liar .
crime lab just finished processing the boat .
they found the transponder intact
and fully functional .
okay , so remo was playing with us
when he said it was malfunctioning .
mm @-@ hmm . it gets better .
i hacked into his system ,
pulled the navigational logs for his entire fleet .
turns out there were two boats at blake &apos;s dive sites
the night that he was killed .
remo tracked blake out there .
remo julian ! five @-@ o !
clear .
clear .
i checked the rest of the floor .
remo &apos;s gone .
steve !
danny ?
i think i found captain murphy , our vic &apos;s grandfather .
remo took the money and tossed the bones aside like trash .
looks like he left in a hurry , too .
all right , so that &apos;s how he dried the cash , right ?
guys , i got fresh blood on this bill .
this could mean we have another victim .
take a look at this coffin .
looks like it could have been in our sunken ambulance .
doesn &apos;t look like remo julian
will be giving us any nswers .
looks like cod was blunt- force trauma to the head .
victim also shows signs of defensive wounds on his arms and his neck .
hmm . that &apos;s peculiar .
what &apos;d you got ?
subdermal bruising .
looks like the fatal blow left an indentation
on the victim &apos;s skull .
oh . and it looks like our killer wears a very unique ring .
take a look at this .
that &apos;s the crest of the hms pegasus .
how did you know that ?
because i met remo &apos;s killer .
jimmy koller .
that &apos;s an interesting ring . what is that ?
move in .
okay , listen , there &apos;s a tiny , tiny chance
that you &apos;re going to get out before your 90th birthday .
but that window of opportunity is closing rapidly , you understand ?
okay , window &apos;s closed . thanks .
wait .
blake radioed remo from the wreck site .
said he needed a winch and a couple guys
to help dredge something up .
right , &apos; cause not often you find
a casket at the bottom of the ocean .
especially one with $ 2 million in it .
all right , so how long before you and remo turned on blake ?
hey , remo and i were willing to split the money
three ways , but blake gave us some line
that the bones belonged to his grandfather .
he was just trying to cut us out .
so you killed him .
then you killed remo
so you could take the whole $ 2 million to yourself , right ?
no honor among thieves .
blake wasn &apos;t lying .
he didn &apos;t care about the money .
and that really was his grandfather .
he just wanted to bury the man ,
put the past behind him .
family plot &apos;s still in maui .
va &apos;s making arrangements to send the remains there for burial .
all right . did you notify the family ?
not yet . i wanted sylvia to hear it from me .
you going to tell her about blake , too ?
she needs to understand her son didn &apos;t die for nothing .
because of what he did ,
her father can finally be laid to rest .
small consolation , i know .
it &apos;s times like these , all the little things help , don &apos;t they ?
yeah .
listen , lori , i can make the notification if you want .
thanks . no .
i need to do this on my own .
it &apos;s not the first time
i &apos;ve had to tell a parent they lost a child . i just ...
hoped i &apos;d never have to do it again .
who &apos;s that ?
that is an old friend .
excuse me a sec .
uh , dinner &apos;s not until 8 : 00 , and you ...
i think you may be a little overdressed .
actually , i &apos;m going to need to ask for a rain check .
okay .
orders came in today ,
and i &apos;m being sent tad to navcent .
my flight for the gulf leaves tonight .
tonight ?
yeah .
so ...
anyway , um , before i left , i just wanted
to get back to you about that thing that you asked me about .
i checked with the dod ,
and they said that they haven &apos;t received any intel requests
from commander white .
you sure about that ?
yeah .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i should probably go pack .
yeah , listen , um , catherine ,
uh , about this rain check , uh ...
you &apos;re probably gonna get some leave in the next few months .
why don &apos;t we meet somewhere halfway ?
i don &apos;t know . mumbai or something ?
i like indian food .
i know , but if your mom catches you
up this late , she &apos;s gonna kill us both , okay ?
go to bed , all right ?
and i &apos;m gonna see you really soon , and i can &apos;t wait ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna kiss you all over your little monkey face , okay ?
all right .
danno loves you , too , baby .
detective williams .
what are you doing here ?
uh , well , it &apos;s a nice night ,
and i was wondering if you &apos;d like
to get a cup of coffee with me .
i would like that .
chin , i &apos;m really not up for a lecture right now .
good , because i &apos;m not here to give you one .
i &apos;m here to apologize .
everything you &apos;re going through right now
i &apos;ve been through myself .
getting kicked off the force ,
dealing with disappointment ,
the frustration , the anger .
i remember what that felt like .
and i also remember that the only person who stood by me
through all of it was you .
you &apos;re not alone in this , kono .
when you want to talk ,
i &apos;ll be here .
you never gave that video to the dod , did you , joe ?
no .
you know what ?
i know he was your friend , but he was my father .
whatever it is you &apos;re trying to protect me from ,
i can handle it , you understand me ?
did you ever think that maybe
you &apos;re not the only one i &apos;m trying to protect ?
what are you talking about ?
risk versus reward , steve .
how much damage are you willing to do to your family ,
to your family &apos;s name ?
&apos;cause whatever &apos;s on that video
is not going to bring your father back .
