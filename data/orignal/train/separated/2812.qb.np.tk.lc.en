we kind of broke up instead .
what ?
my god ! it &apos;s on the ceiling !
that &apos;s okay .
this is more important than fruit ...
... on my ceiling .
you broke up ?
yeah , but it &apos;s okay because when ross left , mark came over .
oh , no ! you and mark ?
it &apos;s okay . calm down .
mark and i talked ...
... and i realized how much i love your stupid brother .
we got our problems , but i really wanna make it work .
morning !
the one the morning after
it &apos;s me . i &apos;ve been trying to reach you all night . i feel awful .
there &apos;s nothing between me and mark .
this whole breakup thing is just stupid .
i &apos;m sorry i put you through it .
and i don &apos;t want to get back together over a machine .
so i love you .
i love you .
and you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go to bed now ...
... but on my way to work tomorrow , i &apos;ll stop by around 8 : 30 . bye .
chloe , how &apos;s it coming ?
what kind of puppy do you think i should get ?
well , how about a big one ?
but my apartment &apos;s so
then a small one .
we have to go .
wait ! where &apos;s my shoes ?
you need shoes ?
do i know why we &apos;re rushing ?
you know my girlfriend ?
it turns out that she wants to get back together .
i found it !
that &apos;s so great for you guys !
you must be so happy !
yes , i am . one of the many things i &apos;m feeling .
good luck with your girlfriend .
thank you .
you got my message ?
you are right on time !
so can i be your girlfriend again ?
yes , you can . very much .
why are you mopping your ceiling ?
there &apos;s banana on it .
i have the spirit of an old lndian woman living in mine .
so , then , you know .
the mailman was here , so i brought your mail .
oh , good . thanks .
now , what is fabutech ?
don &apos;t judge me too much , okay ?
i saw this infomercial , and i swear i have never ...
... bought anything on tv before .
except for this mop .
but there was this amazing stuff on leg @-@ waxing
waxine !
yes ! have you seen it ?
it &apos;s incredible ! i want to be a waxine girl !
i know !
do you think it really doesn &apos;t hurt ? how can they do that ?
hello ! organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest ?
they have the best stuff in there .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
we figured when we couldn &apos;t find you , you &apos;d gone to make up with rachel .
which is probably what you should have done .
you think ?
god , i &apos;m in hell . i mean , what am i gonna do ?
rachel &apos;s all &quot; i love you , &quot; and all i can think about ...
... is what is she gonna do when i tell her what i did ?
first , we should address the more important question ...
... how dumb are you ?
look , we &apos;re trying to rebuild a relationship here , right ?
how can i do that without being honest ?
i &apos;m onboard about the total @-@ honesty thing . i am .
just not about stuff that &apos;s gonna get you in trouble .
he &apos;s right . nobody benefits , and you &apos;ll just hurt her .
and there won &apos;t be a relationship left to rebuild .
don &apos;t you think
if you have to tell her , at least wait till the timing &apos;s right .
and that &apos;s what deathbeds are for .
yeah , okay .
all right .
okay . now , we just have to make sure she doesn &apos;t find out some other way .
did you think about the trail ?
what trail ?
from the woman you did it with ...
... to the woman you hope never finds out you did it !
always think about the trail !
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any trail .
chloe works with that guy , lsaac .
isaac &apos;s sister is jasmine , who works at the massage place with phoebe .
phoebe is rachel &apos;s friend , and that &apos;s the trail ! i did it !
&quot; after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg &quot;
did that !
&quot; grasp the linen strip by its tab ...
... and pull it off in one quick , pain @-@ free motion . &quot;
was it not &quot; pain @-@ free &quot; ?
no , it was pain @-@ ful !
my god , they should call it &quot; pain @-@ zine , now with a little wax . &quot;
the girls on the commercial don &apos;t seem to think it &apos;s that bad .
because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid .
but you know , if you don &apos;t believe me , please , be my guest .
now are you glad we didn &apos;t start with the bikini strips ?
chloe , hi .
is this about me taking your watch ?
you took my watch ?
i &apos;m sorry . i do that .
you keep it . listen , did you tell anyone about us ?
i feel like it really isn &apos;t anybody &apos;s business .
exactly . so you didn &apos;t mention anything to lsaac ?
i tell lsaac everything .
you do ? of course you do .
hi , lsaac . you know , we haven &apos;t actually met .
you dog !
yes , i suppose i am a dog . but see , i happen to have a girlfriend .
right . rachel from the coffee place .
that &apos;s the one . listen , i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
i know . it doesn &apos;t matter how much we love them .
monogamy is too cruel a rule .
listen , can you keep this information to yourself ?
no problem . we gotta look out for each other .
we &apos;re the same , you and me .
actually , no , we &apos;re not .
yeah , we are .
no , we &apos;re not .
yeah , we are .
no , we &apos;re not .
okay , we &apos;re not .
right .
but we are .
fine . i just need to know that you won &apos;t tell your sister .
i can promise not to tell her again .
jasmine ? we met at phoebe &apos;s birthday party . i &apos;m ross geller .
you did a bad thing !
yes , i did .
very bad !
very bad .
very , very bad !
i &apos;m agreeing with you .
listen , did you happen to tell phoebe yet ?
please . please don &apos;t .
i love my girlfriend very much and i want to work it out with her .
all right .
thank you . thank you .
but you should talk to my roommate . i told him , and he knows phoebe too .
who &apos;s your roommate ?
gunther , tell me you didn &apos;t tell rachel about me and the girl from the copy place .
i &apos;m sorry .
was i not supposed to ?
okay , l got an idea . why don &apos;t you pull off mine , and l pull off yours ?
or , you pull of yours , and l will leave mine on ...
... because l think l can make this look work .
come on , phoebe . we can do this .
all right .
all right .
okay .
what is it ?
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re all right .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
we were just waxing our legs .
off ?
for your information , this is a pain like no man will ever experience .
unless you &apos;ve been kicked in an area ...
... that god only meant to be treated nicely .
women just have a lower threshold for pain than men , that &apos;s all .
i mean , come on , it &apos;s just a little wax .
oh , yeah ? come here .
oh , that &apos;s mature .
so now i just pull it off ?
that &apos;s right .
okay , tin man .
rachel , come on.just talk to me . please !
talk to you ? i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
nothing . nothing .
she said it was okay .
what are they talking about ?
just get away from me !
i made a mistake , okay ?
a mistake ? what were you trying to put it in ? her purse ?
where did he put it ?
you had sex with another woman !
oh , my god !
i knew something was wrong because my nails didn &apos;t grow at all yesterday .
i guess they had a fight , and he got drunk
you guys knew about this and didn &apos;t tell us ?
he has sex and we get hit in our heads !
i want you to leave ! just get out ! now !
i want to stay and talk about this .
all right . how was she ?
what ?
was she good ?
don &apos;t answer that .
you said you wanted to talk about it . let &apos;s talk . how was she ?
she was ....
awful .
she was not good .
horrible . nothing compared to you .
she was different .
good different ?
nobody likes change .
just stop !
what ? okay ! okay ! okay !
should we do something ?
yeah . never cheat on rachel .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i &apos;m sorry . i was disgusted with myself ...
... and this morning i was upset ...
... and then i got your message and i was so happy .
and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment
whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! wait a minute .
what time did your little friend leave ?
oh , my god . she was there ? she was still there ?
she was in there when i was in there ?
listen , the important thing is she meant nothing to me .
and yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship !
i didn &apos;t think there was a relationship .
we &apos;d broken up .
we were on a break .
that , for all i knew , could last forever . that is a breakup .
you gonna get out of this on a technicality ?
i &apos;m not trying to &quot; get out &quot; of anything .
i thought our relationship was dead .
well , you sure had a hell of a time at the wake .
i don &apos;t think we should listen to this anymore .
what are you doing ? we can &apos;t go out .
why not ? i &apos;m hungry .
because they &apos;ll know we &apos;ve been listening .
god ! and to have to hear about it from gunther !
i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn &apos;t happen !
oh , that is so sweet .
i think i &apos;m falling in love with you all over again .
we can go out . they have other things to worry about .
we &apos;ll be fine .
rachel , i wanted to tell you . i thought i should .
and then chandler and joey convinced me not to !
wax the door shut . we &apos;re never leaving .
it &apos;s phoebe . someone has to take my 9 : 00 with mr. rehak ...
... because it &apos;s 9 : 15 now , and i &apos;m not there .
no , l &apos;m in the middle of a huge relationship fight , so ....
oh , that &apos;s all right.lt &apos;s not mine .
none of this would &apos;ve happened if i didn &apos;t think ...
... you were having sex with mark ?
all right .
let &apos;s say i had slept with mark . would you have been able to forgive me ?
yes , i would .
you &apos;d be okay if mark had kissed me , and been naked with me ...
... and made love to me ?
if you knew that our hot , sweaty , writhing bodies were
i would have been devastated ...
... but i would still want to be with you .
because , i mean , it &apos;s you .
come on , tell me what you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m thinking ...
... i &apos;m gonna order a pizza .
order a pizza , like ...
... &quot; i forgive you &quot; ?
oh , man !
pizza ?
i like pizza .
put olives on the pizza .
we could eat the wax ! it &apos;s organic !
oh , great . food with hair on it .
no , not the used wax .
because that would be crazy ?
could i get in on that ? because i &apos;m kind of hungry myself .
fine .
yes , i &apos;d like to order a large pizza .
no anchovies .
with extra anchovies .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll pick them off .
and could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce ?
you can have the last piece if you want .
well , i should think so . you slept with someone .
they &apos;re gonna get through this , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah . come on , it &apos;s ross and rachel .
they &apos;ve got to .
what if they don &apos;t ?
you think i need a new walk ?
what ?
well , i &apos;ve been walking the same way since high school .
you know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice ?
i think i need a take @-@ notice walk .
are you actually saying these words ?
what , now you &apos;re not even talking to me ?
look , rachel , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i was out of my mind .
i thought i &apos;d lost you .
how insane must i have been to do something like this ?
i don &apos;t cheat , right ? that &apos;s not me . i &apos;m not joey !
it &apos;s 3 a. m . they don &apos;t know that i &apos;ve come home yet .
you notice how they aren &apos;t wondering where i am ?
you know , people can be so self @-@ involved .
you know what ? i &apos;m not the one that wanted that break .
you &apos;re the one that bailed . you &apos;re the one ...
... that ran the moment things got rough .
that &apos;s
that &apos;s what ?
that is neither here nor there .
here we are ...
... in a spot again . what do you want ?
how do you want to handle it ? you want to fight for us or bail ?
look , i did a terrible , stupid , stupid thing , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry . i wish i could take it back , but i can &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good .
i love you so much .
no , ross ! don &apos;t !
you can &apos;t just kiss me and make it all go away .
it doesn &apos;t work that way . it doesn &apos;t just make it better .
i think you should go .
what ?
i really think you need to go now .
this morning you said there was nothing we couldn &apos;t work out .
what the hell did i know ?
there &apos;s got to be a way we can work past this .
i can &apos;t imagine my life without you .
without these arms ...
... and your face and heart ...
... your good heart , rach , and ....
i can &apos;t . you &apos;re a totally different person to me now .
i used to think of you as somebody that would never , ever hurt me .
ever .
now i can &apos;t stop picturing you with her .
i can &apos;t . it doesn &apos;t matter what you say or what you do .
it &apos;s just changed everything .
forever .
this can &apos;t be it .
then how come it is ?
they &apos;ve been quiet for a long time .
maybe she killed him .
let &apos;s go .
is that your new walk ?
