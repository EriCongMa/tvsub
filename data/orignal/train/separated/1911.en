"Thrilling"
You don't have to leave.
It's okay.
Do you want some breakfast?
You don't have to do this.
I'm sorry. I-I know I'm not supposed to sleep over.
I was just so tired.
I thought I was gonna close my eyes for a second.
It's okay.
It's not. I totally agree with you.
This is casual. It's not about snuggling in the morning.
It's easy. That's me. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
Leah, I was gonna order some food, so if you want some--
I'm fine. I gotta go find a costume
for this thing at Joe's tonight, so...
That's right. It's Halloween.
Happy--
Every Halloween we make a choice
about what kind of costume we're going to wear--
Something sexy...
Morning.
Oh, good. Can you take these?
There's a rip in the bottom left.
Oh. I just finished an appy,
And I was going to do it in the 20 minutes before my lap chole.
But I need to get on the phone and order a 3-D printer.
Your grant got approved? That's great.
Yeah, it is, except it's a conflict with a butterfly wing repair.
Well, I need to solve my array problem today.
If I can figure out how to shrink the craniotomy,
I should be able to avoid a lot of the infections that we're getting.
Okay, well, this will only take you four minutes.
I know. I'm just telling you about my day.
Oh, well, I did not factor that into the schedule.
And trick-or-treating still on tonight?
Uh, of course, of course.
Maybe we'll be someone scary...
Alex.
Did you get the house ready?
Yep.
Okay. Candy?
No.
Did you get the pumpkins?
No.
Did you put up the spider webs?
No.
Then how is the house ready?
I got the keg.
Oh, you're having a party at the house?
Um, yeah, Alex is letting us use the house to trick-or-treat from
because we have no neighbors where we are,
So I invited a bunch of families from the day care.
He didn't tell you?
No.
Oh. You should come.
That's fine.
Right. Well, you don't wanna be around a bunch of kids
hopped up on sugar anyway, right?
Right.
'cause I hate children.
Cristina--
But I love your kids.
I should have invited you. I'm sorry. I just thought--
But you should come for a drink.
It's at 7. She's gonna be a butterfly.
I have to go. I have a lap chole.
Or you could be a superhero,
which is what I'm trying to be this year.
How many fingers?
Three. Hangnail on the index finger.
No side effects? My uncle had lasik, like, three years ago.
He still has horrible facial pain
and he's basically addicted to painkillers.
Leah.
Well, your uncle probably came back to work too early
and didn't take the two days off that the doctor recommended.
I am a second-year resident.
16 hours is already more recovery time than I can afford.
Go work. Leave me alone.
All right.
How's it going with Alex?
Radio silence.
Still?
I think it's over.
Well, I don't believe that,
and I have extraordinary vision...
literally and figuratively.
Come on. Time to go round on Webber.
Are you sure you don't want to go home?
Okay.
Hey, kids. You got Halloween plans?
I'll take it.
Yeah, Matthew's having a thing. I'm going as a bunny.
Ooh. Playboy?
Uh, velveteen.
Needs work.
How about you, lone ranger? Are you and Emma going out?
Uh, Emma and I are no longer a thing.
What? Why?
Well, it's just too soon. I'm not ready.
Yes, you are.
Emma doesn't think so,
because I never mentioned being married before.
She said, "Call me when you're ready."
You're ready. Don't you think he's ready?
Well, maybe he's ready, but he's not ready to call.
What's the difference? He's ready.
You should...
He's not ready.
Not ready.
Hey, um, I have the costume in my car.
What time did you wanna meet?
No, I have the costume.
Oh, please, don't tell me we have two astronaut costumes.
We don't. We have a princess.
What?
Yeah.
You--what--that's what you want--
You want her to strive to be a princess?
No, it's what she wants. It's what she asked for.
No, no, no, no. She told me she wanted to be an astronaut,
and that's why I spent three hours last night
sewing patches on a little, tiny flight suit.
Yeah, well, I spent the night gluing daisies on a tutu.
Fine. We can hold up the costumes,
and she can decide whose work she loves more.
you know what? Forget it. You take her.
I'm not doing this.
Are you serious?
As the grave.
That is amazing.
What's amazing?
Dr. Webber wants one of us to do his surgery today.
Oh... Not you. N-no offense,
but I heard you walked into a wall this morning.
Uh, why not me?
Well, you can supervise.
They know this procedure inside out.
They're--they're ready.
I beg to differ.
How do you do a transgastric approach?
Anterior gastrotomy for access and cystogastrostomy creation
through the posterior wall.
What about the posterior approach?
That is a single gastrotomy in continuity with the pseudocyst.
Very nice, and which is the easiest approach?
It'd have to be the intraluminal approach.
Unless you're a fan of intraoperative bleeding,
in which case, do what you like.
I thought I wasn't seeing you until the weekend.
Ah, I couldn't miss trick-or-treating.
Just didn't seem right.
Good man.
That's a bold move, letting the second years
try a procedure like this on you. How you gonna pick?
Bailey, watch them in the E.R. Today.
Tell me which one deserves it.
None of 'em do,
and I don't need to spend a day in the E.R.--
Dr. Bailey, that's all.
Get out of here. We're gonna review an intraluminal approach.
Come on.
Okay, so, you, me, and Tuck--
We should think of costumes that have three parts,
like the three stooges.
I have a witch's hat.
I put it on every year and call it a day.
My day is gonna be about
which of those three residents is gonna kill
the most important patient I've ever had.
Halloween was... kind of my family's thing,
and I want it to be our family's thing,
so go work. I'll figure it out.
You just come with me at the end of the day
with that face and that body and the...
I'll figure out what to put on it.
It's a holiday for children, you know.
Victor Brown--
30-year-old male mauling victim. Vitals are stable.
Let's get him to trauma.
What mauled him?
He--he tackled me. He came out of nowhere.
Wait. Who is "He"?
The guy--
He was snarling and growling.
I'm sorry. A person did this to you?
He started eating my face like some sort of...
Zombie?
Murphy? Edwards?
It's the biter. Multiple G.S.W.S to the chest.
B.P. 90 over 60.
Pulse in the 120s. He's on something.
How is this guy stable?
He's got two bullet holes over his heart.
Cops shot him before he ate that other guy's whole face off.
And he got 4 of lorazepam.
Barely slowed him down.
I want him sedated now.
Push 2 of lorazepam and 5 of haldol.
This guy should not be alive.
Guys, I can barely hear his heart.
Sorry. It's pretty deep.
Just patch me up.
There's no way I'm missing out on Webber's surgery
because of a little neck lac.
Oh, yes, you are.
Where did you come from?
I'm everywhere,
and you are not going into an O.R. with an open wound.
You need to get yourself tested and run an infectious panel,
including rapid H.I.V. on him
and whoever's blood was in his mouth.
Hold up.
Is that a...
Tooth.
One...
Down.
What?
Say "Trick or treat."
No.
God, you're no fun sometimes.
Trick or treat. What?
A treat for you.
Well, first of all, the x-rays are backwards.
No, they're not. The organs are.
No way.
Mm-hmm.
He has situs inversus?
All his organs are completely backwards,
mirrored to the normal position.
This guy was shot twice in the chest.
He didn't die. Murphy could barely find a heartbeat,
but it turns out his heart was on the other side.
I have wanted to see this since med school.
I know that.
Happy Halloween.
It started last night. She loves Halloween.
She's been in this costume for days.
And I have to go out of town today for work.
Last trip was Brazil. I got to go, too.
And I couldn't take her with me on this one,
so we had Halloween early.
We watched part of a scary movie, and --
"Poltergeist." It was awesome.
I paged Dr. Robbins.
No, you paged peds. You got me.
Taryn, I'm Dr. Karev. So, uh, you have a stomachache.
You don't know any magic spells to fix it?
No. Well, we had some candy last night during the movie,
and she got sick...a few times.
Candy for dinner. Nice.
All right, she has some guarding and a fever,
so it's probably not the candy.
I'd like to do further testing. Draw labs.
I still get to trick-or-treat, right?
Are you kidding? The best trick-or-treating in Seattle
is right here on the peds floor.
You go around with these huge pillowcases.
Everyone hands out as much candy as you can carry.
He didn't die.
They shot him in the heart twice, and he didn't die.
I thought he was just crazy.
He was just crazy.
Then why didn't he die?!
I've got a needle right next to your face.
I need you to calm it down, okay?
Is there any pain elsewhere?
It's just sore.
And stiff.
Oh, my god.
Is this rigor mortis?
Victor, zombies aren't real. We know this, right?
You. You should...
qua-quarantine...
Victor, squeeze my hand.
Did you hit your head when he attacked you?
You should quarantine --
Can you smile for me, buddy?
Uh...no, he's having a stroke.
There's pulsatile mass. Could be damage to the carotid.
Maybe a pseudoaneurysm.
All right, get the ultrasound.
I'm gonna book an O.R.
Mrs. Wiltern?
Uh, Walker. Marge Walker.
Take me home, Philip.
Mom? Uh, sorry. She's a little afraid of hospitals.
Oh. Well, in that case, I'll be very, very gentle, okay?
Uh, it says you hurt your leg?
She says it was a bug bite or something. It got infected,
and she says it hurts like heck.
She's been popping ibuprofen like it's candy.
I had to drag her in here.
It's fine. Philip, take me home.
Mom, no. Not until you let her check it out.
Just try to relax, okay?
I'm gonna take a look.
Uh...when did this happen?
About four months ago.
Four months ago?
Maggots.
Gross. Writhing and pulsing.
We know what maggots are.
At first, they were a little bit blurry
because my eyes -- I just had eye surgery.
What? What? What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
You shouldn't be seeing patients.
But I wanna be helpful.
Well, great. Then you can go to the store
and buy some Halloween candy.
Name brands -- none of those smartees or candy corns.
But I'm not supposed to drive.
Luckily, someone invented the bus pass.
Come on, Grey. You're not gonna make her take the bus.
Thank you, Dr. Torres.
There's a shop just up the street. You can walk.
You're looking for what again?
You know, one of those little head mirrors,
that doctors wear.
Ben, you are a doctor.
Have you ever worn one?
No.
Because they stopped using them a century ago.
What are they teaching you down there?
Tuck wants to be a mad scientist tonight.
He should have one of those little head mirror things.
Well, I have a brain in a jar.
But I wanna give him a costume, not a nightmare.
What did he do to you?
Torres and I are working on thought control prosthetics.
I'm trying to figure out a way to insert the sensors
through a smaller craniotomy.
Ohh. You should be ashamed of yourself.
I'm sorry? Oh, well, that's for Zola tonight.
It was ripped. I fixed it.
yeah, if you call this fixed.
Yeah, I could do a running whipstitch so smooth
the butterfly would never even know there'd been a rupture.
What are you teaching up here?
I would like to take a biopsy
to see if the infection's gotten into the bone.
And we are gonna need to take you down to the O.R.
to clean the parasites out of that wound.
No! No! Take me home!
Mom.
Take me home!
No, no, no. Mom. Mom. Mom.
We--we can give you a sedative to ease the anxiety.
No! No needles! No needles! Just go away!
Just leave me alone! Don't! Just go away! Don't--oh!
She's always hated doctors,
but it's gotten out of control since my dad died.
I don't want to sound cruel,
but can't you just put her in restraints
and give her a sedative or something?
Well... I have an idea.
I'm going to the gift shop. I'll be back.
Uh, put her in bed 3. Get an x-ray of the ankle.
Bed 5 should be empty.
Get a rapid influenza.
Could be the flu.
Right away, doctor.
Uh, ma'am?
I'm waiting for my doctor.
Well, I'm your doctor now, so...
What's your doctor's name? Maybe I can find them.
Dr. Brooks.
Heather brooks.
I'm sorry. She's not here.
Yes, she is.
She's always here.
She said she'll only see Heather Brooks.
Can I tell her about Heather?
You wanna tell a sick old lady
her favorite doctor is dead?
That seem like a good idea to you?
No. It's just, she's pretty insistent on seeing Dr. Brooks.
Then tell her it's not possible and treat her yourself.
Um... Where is she?
I don't know. She was right there a second ago.
Uh, Murphy's bitten, Edwards is blind,
And you're bonkers.
No! I--
Another one down.
Holy...
Ma'am, I'd like to get you started on medication.
I need to know your name so we can get you registered.
No, I'll-- I'll wait for Doctor--
Dr. Brooks isn't here. I am.
Just tell me your name.
If you don't, I'll have to go through all Dr. Brooks' charts.
How about you save me all that trouble and tell me your name?
She'll come.
Okay, I'm tracking one of the bullets
through the accessory lobe.
That's the middle lobe.
Right. Right.
It's the right lung.
This is like... driving in England.
you know, I had to keep thinking about every move that I make.
It's gonna take twice as long as it should.
Okay.
You got plans tonight?
Meredith semi-invited me to this babyfest tonight.
But I can't tell if she really wants me to go
or if she just felt she had to ask.
It's so complicated.
Right?
She and I just used to know what the other one was thinking.
I meant this.
There's still bleeding in the upper lobe.
I need more proximal control.
Duval lung clamp.
Straight vascular clamp, please.
Okay. Oh, watch out for the S.--
S.V.C.
Nicked the S.V.C. It shouldn't even be there!
I got you this so you don't have to shut your eyes so tight.
And you don't have to see. You wanna try it?
Here.
So let's forget we're in a hospital.
Let's talk about Halloween.
Do you get a lot of kids at your house?
No.
Oh. Too bad.
All the kids in the neighborhood are Philip's age.
They're all grown up and gone.
But when he was little...
it was nuts.
A real madhouse, huh?
Yeah, kids everywhere.
Philip loved it---his favorite holiday.
He always needed a costume they didn't sell in the stores....
And I always needed to make it.
What's happening?
It's okay. We're just, uh, we're gonna take a little walk.
We're gonna go down to the O.R. and get you a gown.
Is that okay?
Yeah. Yeah, fine.
It's okay. it's gonna be okay.
So... You made all his costumes from scratch, huh?
What did he go as?
Well, one year, he went as an aardvark.
Taryn's labs show a slightly elevated white count,
And some of her electrolytes are off.
Is she gonna be here overnight?
It's just that her dad wants to know
if he should change his flight.
Yeah, his 8-year-old has a potentially surgical abdomen.
She needs a C.T. She's in pain. He should change his flight.
Dude, what is your problem?
I know you think he's an ass, but he's not.
He's not your dad.
Don't even--
What?
Pretend that you're not angry and hurt and about to explode?
I've been doing that. It's not working.
Tell me what I can do to make this better.
Just get a C.T.
So I thought the second one would be easier,
but it's just like having one all over again,
except now there are two.
So you're twice as exhausted.
Okay, we're all set.
Okay. Okay, Marge, we're in the O.R.
And we are ready to operate.
You'll be here the whole time, Meredith?
The whole time.
Okay. Yes.
I'm ready.
Okay.
You know, if you segmented the wings,
then she'd flap when she moved.
She just has to look like a butterfly.
She doesn't actually have to fly.
How'd you swing the time off?
You know, I, uh, I just made it happen.
Halloween was always my favorite night as a kid,
and I just wanted to spend it with my family, you know?
You're so domesticated.
You're suturing a butterfly costume.
You know, uh...
You know, if we attach this to her wrist with strings,
it'd sort of fan out.
That's a brilliant idea.
Right. It's totally worth it.
Yeah, keep stitching.
They're incompetent. It's not their fault,
because it's how they were raised.
These days, parents think all of their kids are geniuses.
And everyone gets a trophy just for being on the soccer team.
And--
They're not the problem.
You are.
I'm trying to teach them, and you won't let them learn.
I can barely get out of this bed.
I can't operate.
Who knows if I ever will?
The only thing that gives me some meaning.
Hell, some days the only thing that keeps me going...
is teaching them.
And--and you're standing in the way of that.
So I'm gonna have someone else supervise 'em.
You're not kicking me off this case.
Yes, I am.
This is why when I fire someone,
I like to do it in their office.
So I can walk out.
Walk out, Bailey.
Now.
Wow, there is barely any necrotic tissue here.
The maggots might have actually saved her leg.
Well, remind me to send them flowers.
We may actually make trick-or-treating tonight.
Yeah, about that--I'm, uh... I'm bowing out tonight.
Arizona and I can't be in the same room
for more than five minutes before everything devolves
into gunfire and screaming.
Sofia has been so excited about Halloween.
I'm not about to let her mommies' bickering ruin it.
So... Taking one for the team.
Are you sure? There's gonna be a pinata...
Shut up.
And pin the head on the skeleton.
Damn it! They're so cute when they're blindfolded.
Bobbing for apples.
They're even cuter when they bob!
I'll take pictures.
Dr. Grey, it's Dr. Webber.
He's asking whether you have room on your schedule
for a cystogastrostomy.
Maybe Derek can take pictures.
Did you get your labs back?
Nope.
The post exposure counselor
gave me this cheerful little pamphlet
on anti-viral drugs to read while I'm waiting.
She said in case I do have H.I.V.,
it might not be a bad idea to start taking them now.
You probably don't have H.I.V.
I might.
I might never see again.
You probably will. My uncle can.
You said he's in constant pain. Horrible pain.
He had to give up his accounting practice.
He can't do math.
I'm not gonna be able to be a surgeon anymore.
The counselor said
there are plenty of other health care jobs available apart from surgery.
Like what?
Like post-exposure counseling.
But I won't know which pamphlets to hand out
if I can't read them.
We're screwed.
So screwed.
That's one jacked up carotid.
Yeah, let's go ahead and prep the synthetic graft.
Okay. Starting it now.
It's yours, Dr. Avery...
from Dr. Edwards.
She wants to know if you think she should
call the... lasagna pleasant?
That's, like, her 15th misspelled text.
She's scared.
Tell her not to call, everything's gonna be fine,
and to keep using her eyedrops.
You know what? And tell her that she's beautiful.
What?
Who are you?
You were never that nice to me when I would spin out.
Well, maybe...
I am trying to be a better boyfriend now.
No, no, it helped that you were an ass.
It made me get my act together.
I'm gettin' married,
and I'm saving this guy's life and his face.
And that's all because of me.
Damn it.
I mean this was supposed to be fun, you know?
You're overcomplicating it.
Just tell your left hand to do
what your right hand usually does.
Haven't you practiced operating with both hands?
Yeah.
Upside down, underwater--
I-I pra--
In a straight jacket.
Yes, I have practiced with both hands,
but I can't just-- cut.
See?
Simple.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Meredith, I just need you to observe while a--
I understand what you're asking me--
Meredith.
Page the general surgeon that's on call.
I don't have the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for saying that you were the wrong choice
to be in charge of my care,
for saying that you should have let me die.
I'm sorry for ever feeling that way.
Because I've remembered what it is to live for.
I would have never gotten here if it hadn't been for you.
So I'm sorry.
Meredith, please. Help me teach them.
What is that, a fan?
Yeah, exactly. The array is a fan.
Now if I can get the fan to go in through a burr hole
and open up under the skull,
the whole area would be covered
with a fraction of the exposure.
How has no one ever thought of this yet?
How have I never thought of this yet?
You don't look like you're regretting
stepping back from surgery at all.
It's only been a week, But, uh, no.
What's the rush?
I got the kid's C.T.
You wanna fill me in?
Adrenal glands are enlarged,
coupled with high potassium, low glucose--
adrenal insufficiency.
Her body's not producing enough adrenaline?
I'm glad you can read.
But there's no tumor.
Unless it's an infection,
maybe blastomycosis.
Oh, god, her-- her dad mentioned
that they just went to Brazil.
What, are you kidding me?
You didn't think you should put that in her chart?
What the hell?
Thanks for your help, and I'm sorry
about the last-minute cancellation.
Where is she?
She was just here.
She was asking about trick or treating around the hospital,
and I just stepped out
to change my flight--
You couldn't keep an eye on her for five minutes?
What's--what's going on?
Taryn's body isn't producing adrenaline.
You know what adrenaline does?
It keeps your organs from going into shock and shutting down
when you get hurt or traumatized or scared.
You said that she started to feel sick last night
watching the scary movie?
She wanted to watch it.
She's wandering through the hospital on Halloween.
Look, if-- if something frightens her,
she could go into shock.
She can get scared... to death?
We gotta go find her.
I'm looking for a crazy lady with weird eyes.
Too soon, Shane.
No, seriously, she disappeared again.
She was Heather's patient, and she won't tell me her name.
And there's no record of her anywhere,
every time I go to find her, she's gone.
Whoa... well, maybe she's a ghost.
Forget it.
Stop. She's probably a stray.
Heather was always taking them in--
the... the homeless, the uninsured.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Get me d-10 normal saline
and bring a crash cart right away!
I'll get it.
Taryn, can you hear me?
Dr. Karev?
Give me that gurney!
Right away, doctor.
She's in shock from adrenal crisis.
Get me her blood pressure,
and get those fluids started.
I'm on it.
Let's get her legs elevated.
Expiratory wheezing, get her on 5-liter O2.
Systolic's 15.
I need an I.V. Hydrocortisone and a central line kit.
Have the p.I.C.U. get a bed ready,
and get her to the E.R.
Right away.
This doesn't look like a hospital.
We've taken all of
the unnecessary medical equipment out of the room.
And Philip is bringing some more of your things from home.
And I've even put a sign on the door,
so all the doctors and staff will respect your privacy.
Do you want me to stay?
Don't you have kids to get to for Halloween?
Yeah, but you-- you know, it's okay. I'm--
Oh, no. You don't want to miss it.
You only get ten before they go off
on Halloween with their friends, getting into trouble.
You gotta enjoy it while you can.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Yeah, and you can make it to your party,
if you you're going.
I am. You know, I'll show up.
I'll have a beer. Mer and I will talk,
and we'll move past this whole thing.
Good.
Oh, it's Meredith.
"If you're coming to the party, could you bring cupcakes?
If not, no problem."
What does that mean?
Um... it's no problem if I don't go,
or no problem if I don't bring cupcakes?
And if I don't go, then there's no cupcakes?
Or will someone else bring them?
And if someone else is bringing them,
why is she even asking me?
Don't overcomplicate it.
Just go.
The cortisone will prevent another adrenal crisis.
Taryn should make a full recovery.
I never would have taken her to Brazil with me
if I had known she could get sick.
I know.
And the movie... she loves scary movies.
It... it was one bad call.
That's all it was, just one bad call.
I'm a good dad.
Don't let what Dr. Karev said...
He's just...
He's so good with kids
but just so crappy with other people.
He knows you're a good dad.
Is my face fixed?
Not quite yet. Our first priority
was repairing your injured carotid,
which was damaged when you were attacked.
Oh, God. The zombie--where is he?
No.
He's--he's not quarantined? Is that where this is?
I... i've been quarantined, haven't I?
Oh, God, I knew it.
I saw this thing on cable about these rituals in Haiti,
and I thought they were all crap,
but you've got me quarantined.
Except you're not quarantined.
Which means...
This is the I.C.U.
You wouldn't tell me the truth anyway.
They've got you on a gag order, don't they?
Because that's what they do--the C.D.C.
Okay.
They--they don't want you to tell me the truth.
Hey, Victor! Victor, hey!
Because otherwise, you--
Hey, hey! listen to me!
Victor, you are not under quarantine.
You are in the I.C.U.,
which is where we take patients after surgery.
You were attacked by a normal guy
who took a bunch of drugs, lost his mind, and attacked you.
He didn't die when he was shot
because he's got a condition called situs inversus,
which put his heart on the opposite side of his chest.
That's... that's random.
Yeah, completely random,
and also not in the least bit supernatural.
And really, honestly, when you think about it,
isn't that, like, a hundred times scarier
than some... zombie apocalypse?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, I guess it is.
See, someone starts spinning out,
you just shut it down.
But, you know, you can still tell him he's pretty,
if you want to.
Fix the wings?
Yes, and changed the future of science.
I figured out the sensor array.
I insert it into a 2-centimeter burr hole.
Great!
Well, I have to find a resident to do Webber's pseudocyst,
or I'm not even gonna make it to trick or treat.
Go. See you at the house.
Okay.
Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.
Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.
Shane...
You win-- Webber's pseudocyst.
Let's go, Shane. Suit up. Big leagues.
I...
I have a patient.
Could I talk to you about Alex?
Yes, I know a place we can go
where no one will interrupt us.
Trick or treat!
Hey, kids, slow down!
Becca, hurry!
Oh, my goodness.
Welcome to my laboratory.
It's great.
Mommy, Ben did all this.
Look, there's even smoke!
Oh, I see!
Well, I-I had some help.
Well, look at you.
Dr. Crazy person.
You look so good!
Okay, go and get your trick or treat bag now.
I told you, this is my holiday.
You are amazing.
He's so happy.
We had fun. You know, we should do stuff like this all the time.
Yeah, he'd love that.
I would, too.
Right?
I mean, this holidays and weekends crap--
I want to be back here in Seattle with you guys.
Yeah, I know.
But, well, you can't drop out of residency
in the middle.
In a few years, we'll--
I did.
I quit.
You what?
Hey, have you seen Wilson?
'Cause I need to get an update on--
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.
You're crying.
It's nothing. I'm fine.
I got bit...
by a delusional, psychotic drug addict
who think he's the undead.
And I'm waiting for the guy's H.I.V. results.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm trying to be easy peasy.
My first needle stick happened on a Tuesday.
It was the second month of my third year
in my internal medicine rotation.
And my patient was suffering from end stage A.I.D.S.
We had just switched over to these retractable needles.
And when I went to put his into the hazardous waste, I...
I didn't retract it right.
And it jammed right into my palm.
And my whole body went cold.
And I had never felt fear like that in my whole life.
Right now...
It's not the time to be easy peasy.
She's dead.
Dr. Brooks died three months ago.
Well, that can't be true.
You're not in the charts.
She was treating you under the table, right?
She was giving you these...
for your asthma?
I didn't want her to get into trouble.
When you run out,
you come back. You find me.
I'll be your doctor now.
She--she was a very good doctor.
Are you as good as she was?
No.
But I will be.
So there's the wall of the pseudocyst.
Now what do you do?
Enlarge the incision with a dissecting instrument
and use a stapler to create the anastomosis.
Good. Carry on.
Faster... but take your time.
Can I tell you a thing about Alex?
He doesn't want me to tell anyone,
but I don't know what to do.
He keeps pushing me away,
and you know him better than I do.
Can't tell me.
I can't?
Telling me is the worst thing you could do.
If he told you, he trusted you.
So whatever it is,
you have to be the one to deal with it.
I mean, of course he's gonna to push you away
because he hates being vulnerable.
But that's when he's gonna need you
to stick with him the most.
I'll keep trying.
We'll, you're gonna have to do better than try,
because my plate is full.
I have too many kids and too many patients,
and I can't handle a broken Alex right now.
You can do it.
Is it out of the question
to get a little consistency in this family?
What consistency? I never see you.
Trick or treat!
Oh, trick or treat.
Look at you. You're so scary.
Here.
Thank you.
You started the program--
No, you upended our lives
because it was extremely important to you.
It's not working.
You are my family, and I want to be with you.
Trick or treat!
Oh, Cleopatra and a ladybug.
Thank you.
Trick or treat!
My life is happening, and I'm elsewhere.
You don't love it?
You? Of course I l--
No, not me. Surgery.
You left town a week after we got married
to learn surgery, because...
You were in love with it.
Yeah. But I am in love with you more.
You really gonna tell me that's the wrong answer?
I'm j-just...
What?
Miranda, what?
Disappointed...
in you.
Can we go trick-or-treating now?
You are so cute!
Okay. Uh, let me get my coat.
This is Emma Marling.
Please leave a message.
Emma, Owen.
Uh, listen, um...
I wasn't ready to talk about Cristina before,
because things between she and I were always so... complicated.
And I can't... I can't do complicated right now.
I don't even want to think about complicated,
and that is what is so great about you,
is that you're, you know, you're so easy.
God... that came out wrong. I don't mean you're easy.
I mean you're simple.
Uh... uh, delete this.
Emma?
Hi.
How'd she do?
Fantastic.
Almost as if she had a great teacher.
Take me through it. I want to hear every detail.
Well, in the interest of education,
why don't we let Dr. Wilson do that?
I like the way you think, Grey.
Okay, well, um, we started your incision using--
No, no. Start from the very beginning.
Where'd you place the ports?
Well, um, we took a look at your previous incision
and decided to place the xiphoid port lateral to that.
Halloween is not for the faint of heart.
There's a surprise around every corner.
Rapid tests negative!
Good for you.
I have to go back in six months
to get tested again to be sure,
but it's looking good.
What's wrong? You still blind?
Bummer.
Also, no hepatitis.
What are you doing here?
Dude, I'm waiting for my boyfr--
Jackson?
Oh, damn it.
Ooh, I'm screwed! I'm so screwed.
I really might never operate again,
and it's my fault.
I went and had surgery on my eyes
because my glasses were just a little bit annoying,
and then I went back to work too soon
because I thought I might get a little bit behind,
which is so stupid.
Yeah. Pretty stupid.
What?
You knew that I was gonna take
the whole day off with you, right?
We could have spent the entire day at home
on the couch while I made you chicken soup
and you watched movies and slept it off.
But, no, you had to come to work.
You had to stress yourself out and strain your eyes
and make yourself miserable,
which I told you was gonna happen.
Can we do it tomorrow?
We're gonna do it right damn now.
Come on.
Some of the surprises are good.
Hey! you made it.
The party was great,
and Sofia is a champion apple-bobber.
The wings look great!
Look at the little space princess!
Hey! Go to mommy.
I don't hear any gunfire.
Yeah, well, we'll only get about ten of these
before she starts wanting to wear slutty costumes
and I'm not about to cut that number in half.
It's the first thing Arizona and I have agreed on in months.
Who's ready to go trick-or-treating?
Time for blast-off!
All right, let's go!
And some of the surprises are bad.
Are you gonna stay here and hand out candy?
No, I'm gonna eat candy in the dark
and pretend like I'm not home.
Alex--
I'll pass out your freakin' candy. Relax.
What's important is that
you can't let the fear of the surprise
stop you from getting dressed up...
and wandering up to a stranger's house
to ask the question.
What are you supposed to be?
Sexy...
witch.
You didn't have something else to do tonight?
I had many options, sharky...
but this seemed the most fun.
Can I buy you a drink?
Tequila.
Two tequilas.
Lights are off!
I was wrong about your dad.
I made a bad call.
I should have let you walk away,
but I never would have pushed you towards him
if I thought that you'd end up hurt.
I didn't see it coming.
You did, and I am so sorry.
But it was one crappy call.
That's all.
So what'll it be--
trick...
or treat?
Get in, before the trick-or-treaters
