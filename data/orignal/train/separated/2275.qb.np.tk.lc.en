第三集
the most powerful sorcerer in all the realms
is stuck inside a tree ?
and you think we can get him out ?
merlin &apos;s prophecies are never wrong .
this rose is now linked to your beast .
as long as it still has petals , he lives .
just because i &apos;m the dark one
doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t still be together .
they &apos;re here to destroy the dark one .
but helping them may be the only way
i &apos;ll ever get my hands on that dagger .
merlin &apos;s tower .
there must be something in here
to get him out of that tree .
you can make that weapon whole again
and use it to snuff out the light .
our yield &apos;s way down , boys .
i know dopey &apos;s a tree ,
but we got to be more productive since he can &apos;t .
he &apos;s producing oxygen .
let &apos;s stay focused .
yes .
no one wants a nasty surprise .
you &apos;re not getting any dust , sister .
actually , i &apos;m shopping for something else today .
something with ... edge .
my axe .
oh , happy , there &apos;s something i learned as the dark one .
if your name is on something , hold on to it .
if we &apos;re going to free merlin , we need witchbane .
yeah , but the labels are all faded .
forget the decloaking potion . it &apos;s not a glamour anyway .
you sure ?
if i &apos;m getting this right ,
the tree could actually be him transfigured , right ?
we could find out with a sample .
yeah , and when we snap off a twig and it turns into a finger ,
who &apos;s crying then ?
come on , someone . witchbane .
you guys sure you don &apos;t want me to just wiggle my nose
and get him out of that tree ?
no .
your magic is dark now . it &apos;s not worth it .
i &apos;ll just keep pretending to be the savior
destined to free him , and we can do this together .
regina &apos;s right , emma .
i heard someone say a woman is right .
that &apos;s always a safe assumption , isn &apos;t it , david ?
how are you progressing , madame savior ?
progress .
slow but sure .
it &apos;s , uh ... marvelous having merlin &apos;s own books to work with .
it &apos;s like talking with the master .
what if we could talk to him ?
what ?
yes .
you are ... very occasionally ... a genius .
yes , if we talked to him ,
he can tell us how to get him out .
a mushroom .
toadstool , actually .
deadly poison .
extremely useful in communicating across barriers ,
even through spells .
says here it &apos;s called the crimson crown .
yes , i know this name .
it &apos;s rumored to grow in brocéliande ,
the forest of eternal night .
its existence is the stuff of legend , though .
almost certainly fiction .
people say the same thing about us . how far ?
a half day &apos;s ride .
but if it is there , it &apos;ll be protected by magical forces .
you know what , david ? wait until we know more .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m needed here .
it &apos;s a chance .
i &apos;m taking it .
hold !
your majesty . don &apos;t try to talk me out of this .
i wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
i just wanted to propose , prince david ,
if it &apos;s quite all right with you ,
that i come along and lend aid .
come with me and we can get ourselves outfitted ,
and then we can quest together as brothers .
this question mark ... that &apos;s my handwriting .
i must &apos;ve marked this page in camelot .
i don &apos;t know if this is the right answer ,
but these books came from there .
i think we were looking at this for answers .
we &apos;ve been violated !
what &apos;s the problem ?
what do you think it is ? your kid .
she took my axe .
dwarfs are your department .
i &apos;ll stay on this .
what do you want us to do about it , leroy ?
help us . we know she &apos;s your daughter ,
but you got to do something , &apos; cause if you won &apos;t , we will .
do not hurt her .
it &apos;s okay . they can &apos;t .
like that &apos;s all that matters ? stop being a scared parent .
be our sheriff again . we need you .
i &apos;ll see about getting the axe back .
thanks for letting us know .
looks like just another insult for us to swallow down .
for now .
why does she need an axe ? that &apos;s alarming , right ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , what could she do with an axe
that she couldn &apos;t just do with her powers ?
david !
just wish she &apos;d talk to us .
i know . me , too .
worst part is ... we can &apos;t save her .
yet . we &apos;re trying .
how ? what am i doing ?
you &apos;re leading .
nobody seems to be following .
oh , don &apos;t worry about the dwarfs .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m worried about emma and how this is my fault .
she made the choice to save everyone .
i should &apos;ve stopped her . i am her father , and now i &apos;m ...
... i &apos;m paralyzed .
there &apos;s nothing i can do , for her , for you , for anyone .
you are doing something .
you are helping our people the best you can .
that &apos;s kind of the problem .
in any world , you are my hero .
remember ?
of course .
go .
i &apos;ve got it .
good morning to you , sheriff .
your majesty . how can i help you ?
any luck finding your blade ?
no luck finding excalibur , i &apos;m afraid ,
but i &apos;m coming to you with something far more urgent .
our reliquary &apos;s been robbed .
i &apos;m sorry , your what ?
magical relics collected by the knights of the round table .
they &apos;re all very precious .
i had no idea it was here
until it turned up in this land nearly empty .
when you say precious ...
there was a magic bean inside .
this bean can take my people home in an instant .
i have to tell you i will find it
if i have to search every residence in your city .
you don &apos;t have to do anything alone .
you can help ?
i &apos;ll get you back to camelot . i promise .
thank you .
a dwarf axe .
now , that &apos;s a creative path to failure .
dwarf axes cut through everything .
nothing cuts through magic .
except maybe a kiss .
have you thought about kissing it out ?
you &apos;re running out of options , deary .
you see , we want you to , uh , snuff out the light .
so , we need a hero to pull excalibur from the stone .
now ... and let &apos;s face facts ... that &apos;s not gonna be you .
so , why don &apos;t you stop messing around
and go get the hero we need ?
and , uh , you and i both know who that is .
it &apos;s all right . you &apos;ll get it .
perhaps it &apos;s time for a spot of tea .
calm nerves lead to clear thoughts .
you &apos;re here so i can keep an eye on you , mute hand maiden .
i don &apos;t need you rolling your eyes at me .
we need to clear the air .
fine . ?
there you are , my lovely voice .
it &apos;s so ... light and feminine .
enough .
now ... let &apos;s have a little chat
about you trying to escape back to oz .
zelena ...
... you know you can &apos;t take that child away from robin .
can you blame me ?
you &apos;re going to take it from me .
this child could be my only chance
for someone to truly love me , and ...
you got a second chance . why can &apos;t i ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
but you &apos;ve had a second chance
and a second second chance .
you can &apos;t keep painting yourself as a victim .
it &apos;s absurd .
you can tell me that life is fair all you want .
all i can tell you is that from in here ,
i &apos;m still seeing one sister with all the toys ...
be quiet and listen for once in your life .
you forgot who i am .
the evil queen .
i can be a far greater nightmare than you can possibly imagine .
but now ...
my gift to you is a promise .
i will make sure your baby is fine
and loved and safe .
just as i promise ...
the same will certainly not hold for you .
i like to be prepared .
is that ... percival &apos;s chair ?
yes .
but no need for more apologies .
a leader does what needs to be done .
i &apos;ll find a man worthy to fill that seat .
this is the one that will stand empty forever .
i assume that was your cir . suitable for a king .
no . mine is no different than the others
in the same way that the table is round .
many of our order are kings and princes in their own realms .
nonetheless , happy to sit shoulder to shoulder
with the rest of their knights .
no one of us above the other .
except for this one .
this is the siege perilous .
reserved for the knight with the purest heart ,
the one destined to carry out the most sacred quests .
belonged to a man i trusted more than a brother .
but he betrayed me .
it &apos;s been vacant since .
lancelot .
you &apos;ve heard of him .
well , all of you are kind of legends .
really ? i shudder to think what our tale must be .
only one of the greatest romances of all time .
your love for guinevere
was ripped away by your best friend , lancelot .
it &apos;s a tragic story that clearly had a happy ending .
the two of you seem like all that &apos;s in the past now .
yes . lancelot was a good man .
the situation was difficult .
i understand .
actually , snow -- mary margaret and i , we met him .
you did ? how is he ?
i &apos;m ... very sorry to tell you this ,
but we ... learned that he died .
i &apos;m sorry .
lancelot failed to resist temptation ,
but he was a good knight .
he tortured himself for his sins far more than i would &apos;ve done .
i wished him happy .
just not with my wife .
careful .
this ... is our reliquary ,
containing our sacred magical items
our knights have recovered .
i &apos;ve never seen magic like that .
it &apos;s the unquenchable flame .
said to be part of the burning bush itself .
this will light our path , and where we &apos;re going ,
we &apos;re gonna need it .
the reliquary , your majesty .
so , you &apos;re the one who found this broken into ?
any theories ?
me ?
well , um ... everyone speaks of the dark one in this place .
perhaps -- - stop being a fool , man .
arthur , to be honest , she did take a dwarf axe .
and , as you &apos;re about to say , the dark one doesn &apos;t need tools .
this lock was pried open . you can see the scratches .
you &apos;re right .
this is your land . what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking i may not know who did this .
but i think i have a good idea of what their next move will be .
i know that look . button on the top turns it on .
i know how to use a phone .
what &apos;s that , then ?
it &apos;s a picture from up inside zelena .
whoa , mate .
no , n @-@ no . it &apos;s of the baby .
they -- they call it a sonogram .
mixed emotions , i bet .
i mean , i know it &apos;s painful for regina .
her evil sister carrying my child .
it &apos;s painful for me .
and yet there &apos;s some part of me
that can &apos;t help but feel happy .
it &apos;s my child .
and i sure don &apos;t want regina to know that .
i don &apos;t want her to misconstrue my happiness for , well --
you got yourself a complex situation there ,
that &apos;s for sure .
unlike your simple love life .
about that .
she &apos;s not the same .
her new house , there &apos;s a door in there
that she doesn &apos;t want me anywhere near .
what do you suppose she &apos;s hiding ?
i was thinking that may--
order up .
order ? i didn &apos;t order anything .
what does it say ?
&quot; meet me on your ship . emma . &quot;
you &apos;re right .
things are complicated all over .
that &apos;s not funny appearing like that .
sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
i know this has all been really confusing
and i have not made it any easier .
i wanted to apologize for overreacting last time .
i know you &apos;re just trying to help .
so , i thought ...
we could just talk and have lunch , like old times .
i &apos;d like nothing more .
but this is hardly like old times .
better ?
come on .
you know you can trust me .
what is it , noon ?
you weren &apos;t kidding about eternal night . glad we have the torch .
i &apos;m glad we sent grif home with the horses .
these woods would make them restless .
your squire works hard , your majesty .
&quot; and you don &apos;t thank him enough . &quot;
i can hear you saying it even when you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re right , though .
i don &apos;t even have the excuse of ignorance .
i was born a common man and i &apos;ve been in service myself .
you weren &apos;t born noble ?
i &apos;m as peasant as they come .
shepherd .
i can feel my backbone relaxing already .
let &apos;s stop with the &quot; your majesties , &quot; shall we ?
of course .
as for my squire ,
i assure you guin more than makes up the difference .
showering him and the others with gifts .
she really is the kindest woman i &apos;ve ever met .
sounds like my wife .
when she decides you &apos;re family , she &apos;d die for you .
that &apos;s not to say guin doesn &apos;t have her fierce side .
with a bow and arrow ,
i &apos;ve seen her take out the eye of a dove in flight .
mary margaret could do that .
she wouldn &apos;t , but she could .
we should have a tourney . get them to compete .
right . &apos; cause i &apos;m sure they &apos;d love
to be pitted against each other
to let us feel good about ourselves .
here .
then perhaps there are better ways for me to show off .
you &apos;re a competitive man for someone with a round table .
i thought the idea was you didn &apos;t want to sit above anyone .
someone who isn &apos;t competitive
doesn &apos;t need a two @-@ ton table to remind him to be humble .
i know my weaknesses .
lancelot and guinevere weren &apos;t the only ones to blame
for what happened to them .
i was a difficult man to live with .
but i made a conscious decision to fix things .
i understand that .
this way .
look upon that , brother .
so it is real .
crimson crown .
it &apos;ll never take both of us .
i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll wait here .
let the torch be your beacon back .
thank you .
how &apos;s he doing ?
not well .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah . but i @-@ i found a healing spell
in one of his old notebooks ,
and i &apos;ve got everything put together
except for one last ingredient .
i , uh , i need an object that touched him
when he was still a man , before he became the dark one .
you must have something .
well , nothing i can find .
still more to look through , though .
you want me to get you some help ?
no .
i &apos;m the only one who knows this place , knows his things ,
and i need to keep doing something .
well , then we &apos;ll make this quick .
has anyone come in to pawn anything today ?
especially a magic bean .
a bean ?
no . no one &apos;s come in . sorry .
it was worth a shot .
that &apos;s all right . you have something else i need .
may i borrow this ?
uh , yeah .
good . this is gonna point us right at our culprit .
what is it ?
it &apos;s not magic , though .
it &apos;s just a souvenir from doc &apos;s birthday party .
it says &quot; doctoberfest &quot; on it .
i &apos;m very well aware .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve got this .
attention , subjects of camelot !
in my hand , you see the chalice of vengeance .
there &apos;s been a theft in your encampment .
the chalice will tell me which among you is the thief .
so , line up for your chance to drink from the sacred cup .
hold on !
take over !
speed is feet , direction is hand .
circle around !
thank you .
think nothing of it .
it would appear you did it . well done .
i have questions .
you want to know if i &apos;m still the same emma .
i imagine that &apos;s not a simple answer , so let &apos;s start easy .
your new house . what &apos;s behind that locked door ?
you know i want to trust you , emma .
why don &apos;t you help me ?
so trust me .
with my powers ,
i could hide anything from your prying eyes , anyway .
well , you &apos;ve answered my first question , too .
you &apos;re not the same emma . she didn &apos;t play games .
yes .
i &apos;m different .
i &apos;m better .
as the dark one .
i used to be scarred and judgmental and closed off .
took me forever to see the magic in this place .
and now i ...
i see things clearly .
i &apos;m not scared anymore .
honestly , i &apos;m an open book ,
if you &apos;re willing to take that trust step .
are you really suggesting
that we move forward in a real relationship ?
gold and belle loved each other .
i don &apos;t think you should use the crocodile as your example .
but think about it .
he was born a coward .
he didn &apos;t find true love until he was the dark one .
you told me how the man he was
groveled and cried on the deck of this ship .
he changed for the better , too .
you &apos;re wrong .
i was the villain in that little drama , swan .
he was a good man trying to keep his family together .
i took this cutlass and put it to his head and taunted him .
i was the only one there who &apos;s changed for the better .
he became an evil , manipulative killer .
do you remember when we were in the storybook
and i taught you how to swordplay ?
more games . enough , swan !
all i wanted was your honesty .
but i &apos;m done ... humoring you .
answer me .
and start by why you brought me here .
it wasn &apos;t because this is what we used to do ,
because that you isn &apos;t here .
you need something , dark one .
tell me what it is .
all i need is your trust . i promise .
i liked you the way you were .
i liked your walls .
i liked being the one to break them down .
the person you found inside is still me .
i have a question for you for once .
do you love me ?
if you tell me you don &apos;t love me , i will let you go .
i loved you .
i guess i &apos;m either steering home or swimming home .
tell me which .
the ship &apos;s yours .
david , what is it ?
the toadstool . it &apos;s gone .
either the phantom knights took it ,
or it was lost in the bog .
we could search for it .
no .
it &apos;s gone .
the word &quot; quest &quot; means to seek , not to find .
it &apos;s the seeking that matters .
you believe that ?
not truly , no .
if the finding is what makes a difference in this world ,
then that &apos;s what i want .
i &apos;m sorry .
my father , he drank his life away .
my brother accomplished nothing but evil .
there was a time i thought i &apos;d be different .
change the world .
but i just ...
i don &apos;t want to only be remembered as the man
who kissed a sleeping princess awake 30 years ago .
i understand .
you do ?
you &apos;re king of camelot .
yes , some large rock decided i was a hero .
prophecy fulfilled .
but since then , i &apos;ve had victories and i &apos;ve had losses .
and i &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s the losses
that require us to be brave .
so , if anything will make us heroes ...
it &apos;s the never giving up . even after a loss .
indeed .
well , we might as well get out of here .
there &apos;s work to be done .
and it &apos;s not here .
good man .
david , if you want to be part of something ,
do something that matters ,
i have a place for a man like you .
i never saw a bean .
just forget the bean for now .
just tell us why you took these things .
i was tired of how i was being treated --
how we were all being treated .
breaking our backs for him , for love of camelot .
i wanted to hurt the king .
grif , i had no idea .
but , you see , you &apos;ve hurt everyone .
we need that bean to get home .
i didn &apos;t see a bean , your majesty .
i &apos;m always betrayed by those closest to me .
look , you know this guy . is he lying ?
i don &apos;t believe so .
and of course , it is possible there was no bean
if it was removed during the six weeks we can &apos;t recall .
okay , well , we &apos;ll find another way to get you home .
working together ?
absolutely .
let &apos;s go tell this guy he &apos;s gonna make his home
in our cell for a little while .
what &apos;s this ?
must &apos;ve fallen out when we emptied his bag .
if that was in the trunk , it was added after the time we lost .
i recognize this .
that &apos;s the one in the book from camelot .
the one i found this morning .
that &apos;s what we were looking for back there .
but why ?
it &apos;s used to communicate through magical barriers .
we must &apos;ve been trying to communicate with merlin .
i wonder if we did .
let &apos;s use it . let &apos;s find out . if we can talk to him now --
he can help us save emma from being the dark one .
david , you did it .
i dub thee sir david of the enchanted forest .
now of the round table .
i know &quot; knight of the round table &quot; is pale fire , indeed ,
next to the title of prince .
no . i am beyond honored .
then rise , sir knight . take your place .
really ?
i never thought i &apos;d find anyone i trust enough
to fill that seat .
but it &apos;s yours .
it will bear your coat of arms .
not bad for a shepherd , eh ?
thank you .
someone there ?
can &apos;t be .
it is .
lancelot . we thought you were dead .
that is a long story .
but trust your eyes -- it is me .
and right now , my struggles don &apos;t matter .
what does is that there is a terrible villain in camelot .
the dark one .
we know . it &apos;s our daughter . we &apos;re going to fix it .
no .
there &apos;s another villain .
arthur .
what ?
trust me .
camelot is not what it seems .
today was a difficult day .
you lied to him , to david .
and it brought me no pleasure .
he &apos;s a good man .
a noble man , but i must think of my kingdom first .
of course you must .
that is always the burden of a king .
your majesty , thank goodness you &apos;re here .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
i did only what you asked .
i took the items , and i kept them safe .
i said maybe there was a bean ,
even though you and i know full well there was never a bean ,
and i did it exactly as you said .
can you please let me out now ?
not just yet , grif .
there may not have been a bean ,
but we can &apos;t have them learning that , now , can we ?
no . no , of course not , your majesty .
they trust me now .
so i must use that trust to protect my kingdom .
these people may seem friendly ,
but they threaten everything we hold dear .
david likes to imagine his quest a noble one .
but his daughter is the dark one .
they lied to us in camelot .
they brought her into our castle .
they are responsible for tearing us away from our home ,
a home we must now reclaim .
but how will we ever get back without a bean ?
i &apos;m afraid we cannot get back .
that &apos;s why we must build a new camelot here in storybrooke .
then you can trust me to help .
i would do anything for my kingdom .
i know you would . as would i.
which is why i need you to drink this .
poison from the agrabah vipers .
but why ?
i won &apos;t tell these people a thing .
not of your own free will , but they have magic on their side .
in time , they will make you talk .
there must be some other way .
i wish there was . truly , i do .
you told me you always dreamed
of sitting at the round table one day .
well , now i &apos;m offering you something greater .
a chance to die in service of camelot .
your death will be
the cornerstone of a great new kingdom .
if you take this .
for camelot .
for camelot .
good , you &apos;re still here .
you need me ?
yeah .
remember how i told you about that door in emma &apos;s place ?
i want to know what &apos;s behind it .
i take it asking her didn &apos;t work .
she &apos;s beyond that . i need a thief .
former thief . those days are behind me .
take it from a former pirate , those days are never behind you .
will you help me ?
granny , have you got my lunch ready ?
yeah , but , girl , you &apos;re gonna need more than that .
sit down for some real food .
i can &apos;t .
oh , my god , look .
yeah , i have to get back to him .
just forget the soup . i &apos;m sorry .
hang on , is it supposed to do that ?
what ?
he &apos;s waking up .
you know , he doesn &apos;t look too good ...
if i do say so myself .
quite a stroke of luck ,
you finding something that touched him when he was a man .
it wasn &apos;t luck . i worked hard for this .
that &apos;s true .
you crushed hook &apos;s heart even more firmly
under your , uh , impractical boot heel .
quiet .
what do you want from me ?
you are the dark one now , not me .
that &apos;s right .
you are not dark . you are also not light .
you are nothing .
your heart is a blank slate .
and that , little man , makes you useful .
because now i can make you
into the last thing you ever thought you would be .
a hero .
and not just any hero .
the purest who &apos;s ever lived .
and then ...
and then i have a job for you .
