that &apos;s beautiful .
yeah , if you &apos;re a farmer &apos;s wife .
ma , come on . my birthday was last month .
it &apos;s fine .
well , we &apos;re not leaving ,
until we find something that we both like .
did you bring food and water ?
all right . do me a favor . try this one on .
no ! let me see .
every girl needs an l.b.d.
not me . i ... got vaccinated .
come on !
let me see it .
that is one stunning
little black dress .
and , jane ?
you look beautiful .
mom , where am i gonna wear this ?
a murder at the boston pops ?
okay , we &apos;re not leaving until we buy it .
okay , okay . fine . get the damn dress .
it &apos;ll look fabulous in my closet .
thank you .
rizzoli .
hey . g-- mom !
knock ! come on !
what ? like i haven &apos;t seen that before ?
okay , frost . i &apos;ll meet you there .
okay .
no , no . i &apos;ll be right there .
all right .
i love you .
no , not -- no , not you . bye .
okay . i &apos;ll see you later . okay .
thank you , mom !
jane rizzoli . victor 825 .
damn . look how young he is .
no obvious signs of injury . it &apos;s odd .
listen . i can promise you
that we are working tirelessly
for justice in this case .
yeah , &quot; tirelessly . &quot; look at him work .
shh ! somebody might hear you .
but as you know , uh , boston has some of the finest ...
i wonder if that guy has , like , a satellite for the news van .
no , he &apos;s not a cop . all right ?
he &apos;s a police officer . he &apos;s a climber .
he &apos;s an ass !
well , he &apos;s got a lot of pulp .
&quot; juice . &quot; we say , &quot; guy &apos;s got juice . &quot;
and you &apos;re gonna be drinking yours out of a sippy cup ,
if you don &apos;t lower your voice .
what killed this kid ? i don &apos;t see anything .
there &apos;s no -- no knife wounds ...
no bullet entry or exit wounds .
no external sign of trauma to indicate a beating .
wasn &apos;t killed for his stuff .
his school i.d.
&quot; mathias senna . &quot;
15 -- god .
i &apos;m never having kids .
what do you got for me , rizzoli ?
don &apos;t you want to wait for the camera crews ?
there &apos;s no obvious cause of death .
i &apos;ll know more after the autopsy .
hey , hey . hey .
don &apos;t touch anything in my crime scene , all right ?
so as to not contaminate .
right .
you might want to take a look under there .
i &apos;m not finished processing the scene .
well , i bet that you could match those shoe prints to that skateboard ...
if you tried .
i &apos;d do it myself ,
but i don &apos;t want to contaminate your crime scene .
thank you . that &apos;s very helpful .
you &apos;re welcome .
bye .
that went well .
find something .
mathias ?
mathias ? !
mathias .
mathias .
mathias .
no !
no , no , no , no .
no , no , no .
mathias
he didn &apos;t come home last night .
i even called his father .
you &apos;re divorced ?
since he was 10 . we are fighting .
over custody of mathias ?
all he wanted to do was skateboard .
i told him it &apos;s not safe out there !
he wouldn &apos;t listen .
the devil got into my boy .
and left me alone with his curse .
what do you mean &quot; the devil &quot; ?
he was not the same
after he met those boys !
the skateboarders .
we &apos;ll need their names .
i don &apos;t know them .
i just know they are bad .
mrs. senna ...
i understand that you don &apos;t trust us right now .
but we want to find your son &apos;s killer
as badly as you do ,
and i promise you we will do everything --
everything we can to find the person who did this .
thank you .
he was all i had .
how much you know about cape vrde ?
you mean ,
do i have any special insight because i &apos;m black ?
yeah .
the gangbangers i &apos;ve arresd
are usually somewhat suspicious of white female cops .
it &apos;s a pretty insular culture .
uh , not that i really know much .
they think of themself as more creole than black .
this mathias was a good kid .
he &apos;s got no arrests , good grades .
all right , let &apos;s look at everything .
pull up sex offenders and predators in the area ,
see if anything pops .
got it .
that comment the ... the mother made about the devil getting into her son .
let &apos;s see if there &apos;s any tie
to local gangs , devil worshipping .
and we narrow it down to , uh , skateboarders .
nice . i &apos;ll check with bric .
you seen korsak ?
coffee shop .
again ?
hey , korsak .
would you like coffee , detective ?
uh , no , thank you .
who &apos;s she ?
new .
what are you doing here ?
working -- on my testimony for the o &apos;reilly murder .
i &apos;m up tomorrow .
yeah , but why are you working here ?
uh ... it was cold at my desk .
all right . how &apos;s the trial looking ?
bunch of idiots on the jury who watch too much tv ,
waiting for the presto @-@ bango magic dna .
listen . you still got your connection at family court ?
okay , i got a juvie victim named mathias senna .
what do you need me for ?
well , i need to know now what is in that custody hearing .
oh , sure . i &apos;m not doing anything .
thanks .
and switch to decaf .
lungs are congested and heavy ,
but overall organs appear normal .
so what &apos;s the cause of death here ?
i don &apos;t have one .
mees lines .
possible indicators of toxins in his system .
so he was poisoned ?
mm . doubtful .
a few pinpoint petechial hemorrhages
could indicate asphyxia .
so he was suffocated .
no airway obstruction or external indication of strangulation .
hello ? cause of death .
do you think lieutenant grant was sexy ?
you know , in a male kind of way ?
do you like him ?
not my type .
you know , i &apos;ll do a tox screen on arsenic and heavy metals .
both of which can cause mees lines .
you just said he wasn &apos;t poisoned , maura .
i said it was doubtful ,
based on the evidence .
god , woman .
grant &apos;s a brass @-@ kisser .
even when we were young ,
he had all the nuns wrapped around his little finger .
&quot; oh , i &apos;ll erase the board for you , sister mary pat . &quot;
at recess , he would yell out ,
&quot; roly @-@ poly rizzoli eats cannoli . &quot;
oh , you were overweight ?
no . i was athletic .
strong .
maybe i was a little chubby .
why ? what &apos;d they call you ?
&quot; maura , the bore @-@ a . &quot;
you know .
they meant &quot; boring , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t rhyme .
do you think maybe i was ?
what is that ?
crime lab confirmed the presence of candle wax .
what ?
hold your questions .
these dark particles ?
those are burned feathers .
okay , let me guess .
he was smothered with a burning down pillow
while ... he drank candle wax .
no .
maura , i know it makes you break out into hives
if you have to guess ,
but i need a theory , okay ?
just -- just one .
the medical evidence is consistent
with what i would expect to find
if the victim went through an exorcism .
he was killed by an exorcism ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
the dad &apos;s not religious . it &apos;s the mom &apos;s church .
it &apos;s a storefront .
well , it may not look like a church ,
but it &apos;s an urban crystallization
of a larger american pattern of religious choice .
yeah .
it &apos;s also a good scam .
even the drive @-@ thru chapels are tax @-@ exempt .
well , commercial spaces can still be sacred .
this is the guy who runs it .
father osorio kokou ,
leader of the cidade velha church .
born &quot; reginald perry ... &quot;
in and out of jail since he was a kid .
robbery , assault .
oh , check fraud .
started his church while he was on parole .
so he &apos;s raking it in ,
exorcism goes bad , he dumps the boy &apos;s body .
excuse me . this is an awful lot of speculation .
it &apos;s a theory . it &apos;s different .
besides , who in this day and age is performing exorcisms ?
well , the catholic church has been performing exorcisms
since the second century , and they still do .
it &apos;s an effective ritual for expelling demons .
good to know .
this is father kokou , my priest .
hello .
hello .
we &apos;re investigating the death of mathias .
did you perform an exorcism on him ?
we performed purification rituals on the boy .
yes .
and did you &quot; purify &quot; him
the night he disappeared ?
father kokou would never hurt mathias .
he was helping .
exorcisms are very powerful .
is that what she said ?
no .
is that what you said ?
no .
maura .
i ... i said &quot; may god give his soul rest . &quot;
and she thanked me by saying &quot; stay in god &apos;s peace . &quot;
we were fighting hard for mathias .
the devil was strong in him .
and the devil killed him .
see , we don &apos;t think the devil killed him .
we think mathias may have been killed by an exorcism .
&quot; think . &quot; so you don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re good , reginald .
we &apos;re not finished .
thanks for stopping by .
this is a house in mourning .
it &apos;s time for you to go .
beatrice , that &apos;s up to you .
please do as the priest said .
the forces of evil are powerful .
i can handle evil .
not this kind .
you are a little bit disrespectful .
i was disrespectful ?
father &quot; cuckoo &quot; back there is my number @-@ one suspect .
father kokou .
i know , maura . i was making a point .
well , &quot; kokou &quot; is the most popular boy &apos;s name with capeverdeans .
okay , i don &apos;t need a history lesson . thank you .
very intriguing culture .
descendants from the portuguese explorers
and slaves from the capeverdean islands .
i &apos;m impressed !
i can google , too .
and that father kokou ...
or ... or whatever is a phony .
did you check out that poncho he was wearing ?
a grand boubou .
i said i know .
oh , you knew ? what that robe was called ?
a &quot; boo @-@ boo &quot; ?
well , it &apos;s popular
with the christians in west africa .
though the swahili in east africa
and some bantu speakers in central africa also ...
like their boo @-@ boos ?
yes .
that &apos;s not funny .
okay .
rizzoli .
okay , give me the address .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you back at the ranch .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to the boy &apos;s father .
i &apos;ll get you a boubou .
whoo @-@ hoo !
a &quot; boo @-@ boo &quot; ?
i tried to get matt away from his mother
and that crazy voodoo priest .
i should have taken him home .
do you think that your ex @-@ wife
may have had anytng to do
with matt &apos;s death ?
not -- not beatrice . no .
m @-@ maybe the church .
you did everything you could , malcolm .
and my son is dead .
when did your ex @-@ wife join the church ?
after the divorce .
that priest is a crook .
he got her to give him all of her money ,
even the child support .
he spent every last dime on lawyers ,
fighting for custody .
i mean , we even put off having our own children ...
alicia , i @-@ i @-@ i have a child already .
i know .
i had .
the judge was just about to rule in our favor .
we were gonna bring him home .
get settled , be a family .
dad &apos;s story checked out .
he was getting full custody .
so maybe the mom killed him .
yeah , i &apos;ll e @-@ mail the whole file to you .
um , i &apos;m guessing she &apos;s in the waitress @-@ protection program ,
and you &apos;re working here because ...
you &apos;re her new bodyguard .
i &apos;m working a case here , rzzoli , undercover .
and you &apos;re undercover to get her ...
beans @-@ to @-@ water ratio ?
someone &apos;s been stealing from her till .
i said i &apos;d help her out .
i have a fresh batch of blondies ,
my mother &apos;s recipe .
do you want one ?
don &apos;t want to insult your mother .
i will insult your mother if it keeps my ass smaller .
i hear ya .
how much is missing ?
$ 11.01 yesterday .
$ 14.99 the day before .
wow . 26 whole dollars .
now i understand why you don &apos;t have the time
to do homicide cases .
hey !
i got a full load here !
and i &apos;m in the middle of a trial .
you got time for blondies .
oh , you &apos;re gonna tell me again how much you hate grant ?
you don &apos;t keep your mouth shut ,
and i &apos;ll go tell her how much you like her .
this is a nasty custody battle .
mom and her church against dad .
something there ?
maybe . what did you got ?
tracking matt &apos;s friends and , uh , child predators .
okay .
jane !
hey , ma .
look who i found in the lobby .
well , you weren &apos;t answering your phone ,
and the brand @-@ new officer o &apos;connor wouldn &apos;t let me up .
all right . well , i &apos;ll talk to him .
thanks .
uh , hey , do you have matt &apos;s autopsy report ?
yes , i &apos;m waiting on tox and micros ,
but i can tell you this conclusively ,
it was not a natural death .
really ?
you could knock me over with a chicken feather .
uh , and what are you doing here ?
i , uh , brought you the dress
that you &apos;re going to wear tomorrow
when you come to dinner .
it &apos;s just the solernos , mom .
so ? you can &apos;t look nice ?
ooh . look at this . oh , wow .
look at the detailed ottoman ribbing .
yeah , it &apos;s got that , uh , grecian v @-@ neck .
oh , gorgeous woven @-@ edge hem .
jane .
yeah .
um , listen , when you two are done playing &quot; project runway , &quot;
i got work to do .
i know you always forget to eat .
thank you .
i love you .
love you .
well , look at that .
want some ?
is it okay ?
yeah .
all right .
look at this .
oh . what is that white substance ?
fluff .
light , downy particles of cotton ?
it &apos;s marshmallow .
and the brown subse is called peanut butter .
it &apos;s ground @-@ up , heavy , oily particles of peanuts .
what , they didn &apos;t have that in your fancy boarding school ?
oh , it &apos;s really good .
two hits on pedophiles that like matt &apos;s type ,
both in custody when he disappeared .
all right , what about his skateboarder friends ?
gang unit says matt was hanging with some bad kids .
ran the names ,
they &apos;ve all been brought up
on minor drug charges , except matt .
this is the gang leader .
&quot; cruncha &quot; ?
a.k.a. jerome , 18 ...
and the only adult .
he recruits juveniles on skateboards to run drugs for him ?
maybe matt said no .
the origin of gang names is actually quite fascinating .
a nickname signifies a change in status or identity .
you &apos;re not a true member until you have a nickname .
yo , dr. death .
jane @-@ lo needs a cause of death ,
not a seminar on gangster nicknames .
maybe there &apos;s something to what doc is saying .
thank you .
if matt had a nickname ,
could mean he was in cruncha &apos;s gang .
so maybe it &apos;s time to talk to cruncha .
yo .
do you know this guy ?
yeah , that &apos;s , um , that &apos;s the homie ollie right there , man .
we used to skate .
so ollie was mathias &apos; nickname ?
yeah , he was , uh , he was bad on the board .
but , uh , i &apos;m done talking to five @-@ oh &apos;s .
so you can bother someone else , dude .
you mind , jane ?
i , uh ...
didn &apos;t make it to the gym today .
yeah , be my guest .
let me go ! let me go , dude !
let me go !
i &apos;m not a dude . i &apos;m a detective .
if you disrespect that , i will hurt you !
you got that ?
you got that ? !
yes , i got it ! i got it !
now , your boy got killed out here .
look , i ain &apos;t killed nobody , man .
you go ask his mother !
crazy cape verdeans and they -- they hexes !
and -- they -- they evil , man !
them brothers and sisters at that church are off the chain !
so , just let me go , man !
i didn &apos;t do nothin &apos; , man .
get out . get out of here .
so , what are you thinking ?
my gut says he &apos;s right .
church and the priest are evil ,
but it &apos;s not enough for a warrant .
nice move .
another set of micro and tox reports came back .
all negative .
i could run tox screens every day ,
every day for the rest of my life
and still not have a cause of death .
gee , that &apos;s encouraging .
all right , what about , um , herbs
that they use in exorcisms ?
can you run those ?
yeah , already on it . it &apos;ll be in the next screening .
this is so frustrating . this poor kid !
poor parents .
what is it ?
shh , shh , shh .
i hate snakes .
you can &apos;t take me off this case .
i &apos;m not taking you off the case . okay ?
but you can &apos;t ignore a threat like that .
it &apos;s a crazy priest and some garden snakes !
come on !
yeah . i understand what it .
hey , jane , whoever did this covered the security lens
with spray paint .
no prints . nothing on the tape .
do exorcism priests tag ?
hey . hey ! no jokes .
okay ? this is a very dicey political situation .
we cannot be seen as persecuting a priest or the church .
what if he did it ?
come on , joe , is that all you care about ,
is how this is gonna affect your career ? !
no , what i care about is you going about this in a smart way
so it sticks !
so you believe me ?
yes .
get kokou .
just be careful .
okay . thank you .
yet another tox report that came back negative .
he didn &apos;t die from an herb commonly used in exorcisms .
well , look for the uncommon ones .
it &apos;s still thousands . we have to narrow it down .
maura , i can &apos;t go after that priest
until i know what matt died of .
well , i &apos;m not gonna guess .
all right , well , what if you were to guess ?
just hypothetically guess .
what would be your guess ...
hypothetically ?
i found several cases of people in the literature ...
who were hexed to death .
murder by hex .
all right , enough guessing .
well @-@ documented cases .
victims who were so convinced that they were cursed
that they suffered
catastrophic catecholamine @-@ induced arrhythmia .
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
heart attack .
a heart attack because they were scared ?
my kid didn &apos;t die of fear .
well ... haven &apos;t you ever been afraid of anything ?
uh ... witches .
my family went to salem when i was little .
see ? you were very impressionable .
yes , i had to sleep with a night @-@ light .
why ? what were you scared of ?
chromobacterium violaceum .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a flesh @-@ eating bacteria .
crawls inside your ear or your nose ,
and it starts eating you from the in ...
okay .
i @-@ i got it .
thank you .
it &apos;s horrible .
every culture has an exorcism ceremony .
you know , and there &apos;s no law
against being a charismatic religious leader .
yeah , yeah , like jim jones and kool @-@ aid
酷爱 : 一种兴奋剂
and david koresh and waco .
瓦柯 : 地名
what could go wrong ?
i feel like going to church . you ?
we &apos;re about to do a ceremony .
i &apos;m about to serve a search warrant .
this is a very disruptive way to observe a foreign culture .
well , at least one of us will fit in .
you could have told me you had a warrant .
she didn &apos;t .
we didn &apos;t have time .
you lied ?
no .
i said i was about to serve a warrant .
i didn &apos;t say when .
your rituals could seem as strange to others ,
as ours do to you .
blood into wine ,
bread into flesh .
he &apos;s right .
it &apos;s no different than the poteau @-@ mitan ,
linking heaven and hell .
is it ?
you know about the poteau @-@ mitan ?
i spent two years in dakar
with the medecins sans frontieres .
you were in doctors without borders ?
why can &apos;t you just say that ?
please .
let us complete the ceremony ,
help sister beatrice .
then you can do your search .
only if we can observe .
if you wish .
don &apos;t worry .
no . why worry ?
we &apos;re just locked in a room with an ex @-@ con
who &apos;s about to do an exorcism .
this is great .
snakes !
she believes the devil that possessed her son
is inside of her .
think of an exorcism as a ...
as a massive therapeutic intervention .
weapon .
passed from her son &apos;s heart to her !
liberam !
liberam !
get everybody out the back ! go !
stop !
where &apos;d you get the sweatshirt ?
my homie ollie gave it to me .
right before you put a pillow over his head
and smothered him to death ?
look , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m a skater , not a killer .
that &apos;s cute , jerome .
you just threw a molotov cocktail at a cop .
you think you can scare the cops off this case ?
with some snakes and firebomb ?
what are you talking about snakes , man ?
brother ain &apos;t messing with no damn snakes .
and the firebomb ?
look , the voodoos killed ollie .
i want a lawyer .
okay , we &apos;re done .
take him to lockup .
he has kids do petty crimes to cover for his ass ,
but he throws a revenge bomb himself ?
no . he didn &apos;t kill him .
so you make the priest for it ?
oh , big daddy voodoo isn &apos;t saving souls .
i haven &apos;t ruled out the parents , either .
damn it . i am late for dinner .
my mom &apos;s gonna kill me !
you were firebombed , jane .
it &apos;s a good excuse !
yeah . you don &apos;t know my mother .
will you call her and tell her i &apos;m on my way ? !
okay ? !
yeah .
come on .
hi , ma .
i &apos;m sorry .
no worries . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
like it ?
yeah .
help me out ? go entertain .
okay , okay , okay .
rizzoli .
wow , you look amazing .
thank you .
what the hell , ma ?
where &apos;s pa and the solernos ?
they went to go pick up ice cream for later !
no , they didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no one else here ?
i made ragu bolognese .
you made me wear this dress for joe grant ? !
what ? no !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
ma !
i need to know you &apos;re taken care of .
by him ?
are you kidding ? !
he &apos;s cute !
he &apos;s not cute !
he &apos;s very cute .
so what ? !
go !
you go !
be a girl !
i love you .
so , i , uh , haven &apos;t seen you in a dress
since , what , senior prom ?
with charlie krenz .
he was a dork .
yeah , he was a dork .
what , are you gonna tell me i &apos;ve filled out nicely ?
uh , and risk being brought up on , uh , harassment charges ?
uh ... maybe .
you look good .
i had no idea she was inviting you .
she didn &apos;t invite me . i broke in the window .
yeah , you always were funny .
yeah .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
how did she convince you to do this ?
your mom ? you kidding me ?
she , uh , she wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer .
she told me it was a reunion or something .
yeah , apparently .
yeah .
so , i , uh
heard about your little incident at the church .
you gonna write me up ?
maybe .
you gonna write me up , uh , for harassment ?
maybe .
but you &apos;d have to do it first .
i think you look perfect .
thank you .
dinner &apos;s almost ready !
set the table , jane !
okay !
i can &apos;t believe my mother .
yeah . it &apos;s just the two of us , right ?
yeah .
my mother still ... oh ...
yeah .
my mother still likes to tell me when it &apos;s gonna rain outside ,
that &apos;s why i bring an umbrella , you know ?
yeah .
no , no . she -- you know ,
she just wants you to be happy . that &apos;s all .
well , no offense , but i don &apos;t need a guy to make me happy .
and no one &apos;s proposing here , so ...
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
this is a bad idea , huh ?
yes . yes .
it is a bad idea .
all right . well ...
okay .
tell your mother i said hi .
tell her yourself .
why are you laughing ?
no .
i mean , se ... do i look stupid ?
no . are you kidding ?
really , you don &apos;t know ?
you &apos;re gorgeous , my friend .
then why are you laughing ?
really ? okay . well ...
tell my mother that .
she thinks i &apos;m some sort of pity project .
she just loves you . that &apos;s all .
want some cheese ?
no .
ew ! no . not out of the dead fridge . no .
if she loves me so much ,
why did she hand me off to that creep ?
i don &apos;t believe you think he &apos;s a creep .
well , i do .
i &apos;ve known him since he was 5 . you know he used to lisp .
so ?
&quot; so &quot; ?
you get rid of guys if they have receding gums .
that &apos;s true .
that is true .
but you &apos;re always complaining that the guys you date
don &apos;t understand or like your job ,
and he respects you .
stop .
really .
you think he &apos;s this political animal ,
but it &apos;s just that it comes out of him
when he &apos;s around you .
because he wants to impress you .
it &apos;s mating behavior .
i think it &apos;s sweet .
i think you &apos;re insane .
i &apos;m off to solve a murder .
night @-@ light on or off ?
on .
i can &apos;t wait till we solve this one .
thank you .
it &apos;s in there .
there are almost always explanations
for these phenomena .
almost ?
well , maybe the dog knocked the flowers over .
maura , it &apos;s four feet off the floor .
hey , you know , maybe ghosts are real .
maybe i could pick the winning lottery numbers today .
maybe i am losing my mind .
i could do a brain scan if you like .
thank you . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s very helpful .
thanks .
can you run one more tox panel ?
okay .
what do you want me to look for ?
i can &apos;t even believe i &apos;m saying this .
okay ?
purple poisonous plants .
purple ?
yeah .
you said that mathias was holding purple flowers .
yeah .
monkshood is a purple flowering plant
that grows in boston .
is it poisonous ?
yes .
and it works very quickly ,
and it &apos;s extremely hard to detect .
but i can try .
tox report on monkshood ... positive .
low levels were detected ,
but enough to determine the cause of death .
mathias was poisoned .
i know why i had that dream ,
because i know where i &apos;ve seen that plant before .
can you type the genetics of the monkshood in matt &apos;s body
and match it to the plant that it came from ?
no .
can you lie about that ?
no . i don &apos;t lie .
well , it &apos;s not a lie .
well , yes , it is .
i know when it is . i start to hyperventilate .
okay , it &apos;s a white lie .
it &apos;s still a lie .
you &apos;ve never lied to a guy
and tell him he was good when he wasn &apos;t ?
no .
like this shirt with this jacket ?
not really . no .
we &apos;re sorry to tell you ,
but your son was poisoned .
what ? h @-@ how ?
actually , with a ... a plant like this one right here .
i didn &apos;t poison my son .
that church .
beatrice &apos;s crazy church .
that &apos;s how they did it .
we don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s interesting is that , uh ,
dr. isles can type the genecs of plants ,
which means she can match the monkshood
that was found in matt &apos;s body
to the plant that it originally came from .
isn &apos;t that right , dr. isles ?
yes . we do do genetic typing .
basically , someone would just have to soak the monkshood
in a bottle of water .
find matt on his skateboard . offer him a drink .
that &apos;s right .
this is crazy .
if ... if i may .
malcolm wouldn &apos;t have a child with you .
is that right ?
wait . h @-@ how do you know that ?
it &apos;s in your custody papers .
it &apos;s one of the reasons that the judge gave you matt .
it &apos;s because of your commitment to him .
there you have it . right ?
he didn &apos;t do it .
yeah , you -- you didn &apos;t want another child .
you had matt .
but you wanted one of your own , didn &apos;t you ?
you knew that malcolm was winning the custody battle .
and you knew it was never gonna happen .
no .
no .
you knew about the exorcisms because of the custody dispute ,
and you figured that the church and his mom would be blamed .
malcolm .
you know she never would have stopped fighting for custody .
and we would have spent all our money on the lawyers ,
and it just was trapping us in the past ,
and i swear , malcolm ,
i swear , i did it for us .
no !
no !
hey ! hey !
no !
mr. senna ! mr. senna , okay !
no ! no !
come on ! mr. senna !
malcolm , i &apos;m sorry .
calm down .
you have the right to remain silent .
calm down , sir .
anything you say can and will be held against you ...
malcolm .
... in a court of law .
malcolm .
your mother tell you it was gonna rain ?
naw .
yours ?
no .
how long you been sitting here ?
you &apos;re soaked .
longer than i expected .
i got to leave for d.c.
soon .
just wanted to come by and see you before i left .
say bye if that &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s in d.c. ?
big job i wasn &apos;t expecting .
what , they appoint you to the supreme court or something ?
no .
not that big .
they appointed me to be a liaison
between the city of boston and homeland security .
ah , that is big .
guess i &apos;ll be out of your hair now .
that &apos;s cool . i mean ...
you know ...
for you .
