and i didn &apos;t get any coffee .
here , take mine .
what about you ?
it &apos;s okay . let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s a fluid situation
in this usually quiet boston neighborhood .
what we know so far -- an elderly man holed up inside ...
that &apos;s right , denise .
we &apos;ve just arrived at the scene
of a tense standoff between an elderly man and boston police .
wow . homicide &apos;s running the scene ?
only till swat gets here .
we think the guy in the standoff killed somebody inside .
sir , please , step back .
dude ... who &apos;s that ?
damn .
she must be from the new crop of rookies .
does she know how hot she is ?
why don &apos;t you go over there and tell her ?
detective .
stop checking out the pretty cop
and make yourselves useful .
i need eyes around the back .
hey , e @-@ excuse me .
any idea how long my street &apos;s gonna be blocked ?
might be a few hours .
do you know the guy in the house ?
leroy ? uh , he &apos;s crazy .
what do you mean by crazy ?
you know , nut @-@ ball conspiracy theorist .
he &apos;s always going off
about , uh , u.f.o.s and government spies and ...
well , i guess i better call my office , huh ?
officer hansen ? let me introduce you .
detectives , this is officer charlotte hansen .
oh , charlie . nice to meet you .
we need eyes in the back .
take charlie , show her the ropes .
i &apos;ll be out front .
yeah . right here .
okay .
oh . you look like you &apos;ve already had a bad morning .
me ? oh , no .
i haven &apos;t showered ,
i had a skeevy building manager check out my boobs ,
i spilled 16 ounces of hot coffee on some perfect stranger .
yeah , no , i &apos;m great .
operations said there was a body inside ?
well , all we know for sure
is what the gunman told the 911 operator .
911 . what is your emergency ?
they &apos;re watching me , stealing from me !
sir , please stay calm .
i need your address .
oh , no , no . daniel &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s possible he &apos;s suffering from persecutory delusions .
who &apos;s daniel ?
we think it &apos;s a sanitation worker -- daniel raine .
we found his truck at the end of the block .
what do we know about the gunman ?
leroy grovner .
72 @-@ year @-@ old retired engineer , lives alone , no relatives .
do we know if he &apos;s on any medications ?
oh , he doesn &apos;t trust doctors .
last time he saw one was in the e.r. six months ago .
psychotic break ?
broken hip .
first responders said they tried to talk to him
but he says if he talks , it will only be to a lady cop .
stay away from my house !
oh ! oh ! oh ! hold your fire !
hold your fire ! you see what i see ?
yeah . smoke . he &apos;s shooting blanks .
all right . everybody just stand down .
hey , stand down . he &apos;s shooting blanks .
maura , come on .
it &apos;s all right -- easy .
mr. grovner . it &apos;s okay .
what do you want ? !
it &apos;s all right , okay ?
we ... we just want to -- we want to help daniel .
okay ? can we do that , please ?
i &apos;m a doctor .
if you let me see him , maybe i can help him .
oh , all -- all right .
but it -- b @-@ but i @-@ it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s a mess down -- down there .
can i hold that for you ?
it &apos;s all right .
all right . thank you .
stand down !
all right . it &apos;s all right . you know what ?
why -- why don &apos;t we go sit down in one of the cars , okay ?
why don &apos;t you take this ? go check on daniel .
all right .
let &apos;s -- let &apos;s just go right over here . okay ? - okay .
maura ?
yeah , i &apos;m here .
he &apos;s been dead for a few hours .
when &apos;s the power coming back on ?
we get lost down here , they &apos;re never gonna find us .
public works doesn &apos;t know why it went off ,
so they &apos;re having a hard time restoring it .
yeah . it &apos;s a garbage man , all right .
daniel raine .
works for the sanitation department .
what &apos;s he doing down here ?
overtime ?
you have enough light ?
enough to see a penetrating wound
resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage .
what &apos;s unusual is the wound pattern .
somebody hit him hard . that &apos;s a lot of blood .
what did they hit him with ? a lawn mower ?
sewing machine ? crock @-@ pot ?
i think we can rule out the crock @-@ pot .
whatever it was , it had a very sharp , jagged edge .
we talked to the neighbors .
they said leroy started screaming
about space ships and little green men .
yeah , right after the lights went out .
then he started shooting .
okay , so the aliens landed , and he lost his marbles .
well , maybe they &apos;re down here .
seems like everything else is .
except the murder weapon .
all right , let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s start a search .
hey . an 8 @-@ track player .
and a flowbee .
i always wanted one of these .
next birthday . on me .
hey , korsak , let &apos;s you and i
go back and interrogate leroy .
frost , frankie , you guys do the search , okay ?
okay .
why me ?
well , it &apos;s either hoarder duty or liquor licenses for me .
i &apos;m gonna have to get this body back to the morgue .
well , leave frankie ,
then i can start the background investigation .
all right .
detectives .
need anything else ?
uh , yeah . detective frost was just ...
... leaving .
well , i @-@ i could use your help .
okay .
you know what , detective frost ? why don &apos;t you stay ?
yeah .
yeah , uh , there &apos;s a lot of work to do here .
yes , there &apos;s a lot of work to do here .
crazy , right ?
almost 49,000 hits already .
it &apos;s going totally viral .
okay , how do you get it off of this thing ?
i don &apos;t want people to see this .
it &apos;s funny , ma .
isn &apos;t that nice ?
enjoying a video of your sweet daughter .
you saw it ?
several times , along with everyone at headquarters .
let &apos;s see it again .
oh . it really gives me a chuckle .
someone &apos;s in a bad mood .
you trying -- you trying -- you trying --
i didn &apos;t touch you at all . i didn &apos;t touch you at all .
oh , you must be very proud .
it &apos;s awesome .
get away .
she &apos;s gonna be famous , mom .
i &apos;m gonna send her the link .
don &apos;t you do that .
you catch the garbage man stealing your stuff ,
you whack him over the head .
maybe you didn &apos;t mean to hit him so hard .
i don &apos;t like it in here .
i &apos;m only talking to the nice lady .
i got this .
it &apos;s okay , leroy . i &apos;m here .
why don &apos;t you just tell me what happened ?
not you . you took my gun .
the nice doctor lady .
i &apos;m dr. maura isles .
can you tell me your name ?
leroy . leroy grovner .
hello , mr. grovner .
let &apos;s start with ,
&quot; no one likes it when someone steals your stuff . &quot;
i don &apos;t see the value in stating the obvious .
but -- but it &apos;s -- it &apos;s my name , and you asked .
just say it .
i &apos;m sure you felt frustrated when your belongings were taken .
i thought i was going crazy at first .
and i &apos;m not crazy , you know .
my things , they were disappearing into thin air .
but then i realized who it was -- them .
&quot; them &quot; ?
they &apos;ve been sniffing around , spying on me .
ask him who .
who &apos;s been spying ?
them -- stealing and spying .
who &apos;s &quot; them &quot; ?
i @-@ i had to put a stop ...
poor old guy , i wonder if he even knows .
so , the next time i heard them over me ,
i used the bug zapper .
got them good .
okay , ask him what he means by &quot; got them . &quot;
how did you get them ?
took them down .
they were mad .
they came looking for me because i had it .
you had what ?
they got -- they got daniel instead .
okay . ask him about the bug zapper .
is that the murder weapon ?
leroy , is that how daniel died ?
you zapped him ?
no , i -- i didn &apos;t kill him . he was my friend .
he gave me good stuff from his -- from his garbage route .
he even gave me a tx @-@ 78 sump pump .
you think daniel was bringing stuff for the basement ,
and then leroy got confused and killed him ?
yeah , maybe .
i hate to speculate . we don &apos;t know what daniel was doing there .
hey , who are you talking to ?
are they here ?
they &apos;re here . no , leroy . nobody is here .
it &apos;s not gonna work . you can &apos;t have my things !
how does a frail 79 @-@ year @-@ old with a hip fracture
take out a guy daniel &apos;s size ?
adrenaline ? fear ?
no one &apos;s here but me .
that may be a killer ass , but it &apos;s not the murder weapon .
glad the power &apos;s back on .
she &apos;s not your type .
oh , oh , that &apos;s my type .
in your dreams .
well , so she &apos;s your type ?
she &apos;s exactly my type .
i mean , do you guys know what the murder weapon looks like ?
i &apos;ll have more information
once i hear back from the medical examiner ,
but look for anything that could be used as a club .
okay , yeah .
i &apos;m getting a lot of electric blankets and blenders .
me , too . i mean , i @-@ i got a pogo stick , a dentist drill .
and ... what the hell is this ?
oh , my gosh . that &apos;s an aebleskiver pan .
my grandma , she &apos;s norwegian .
uh , she makes them all the time .
they &apos;re , like , these cute little pancake balls .
yum . introduce me to your grandmother .
okay .
uh , so , do we just bag it all , or ...
um , well , uh ...
he &apos;s pretty junior .
i &apos;m in homicide ,
so , let &apos;s bag everything near where the body was .
got it .
whoa , sir . this is a crime scene .
oh , no , it &apos;s okay . i live next door .
no , it isn &apos;t okay . i need to ask you to leave now .
i , uh , brought you some lemonade .
i thought you guys might be thirsty .
no . we &apos;re not thirsty . come on . let &apos;s go .
yeah , well , why don &apos;t i -- i &apos;ll just leave it here ?
you can bring the pitcher back later .
the yellow house with the white picket fence .
no , you can &apos;t leave that here . come on .
oh . let &apos;s go .
oh , sure . yeah , yeah .
oh , listen , uh , leroy , uh , borrowed a bunch of stuff
over the years and never returned it ,
so if you happen to come across a metric wrench set
or , uh , a pair of old hockey skates ,
uh , i &apos;d really like to get them back .
we &apos;ll keep an eye out . yeah .
oh , yeah .
he was struck at least twice ,
and whatever instrument was used
left an odd pattern in the wound .
leroy had enough odd crap in his house
to keep craigslist in business for the next 2,000 years .
can you narrow it down ?
it &apos;s interesting .
symmetrical linked hexagons , like a honeycomb .
would be the first time anybody died
from being bashed in the head with a beehive .
it &apos;s not a beehive .
i &apos;m putting my money on an electric toothbrush .
or maybe the knitting machine .
you know , i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
gonna have susie take a look and see what she can find
in the tool @-@ mark identification database .
there &apos;s particulate in the wound .
i &apos;ll run it through gcms .
okay .
oh . that &apos;s frost and frankie .
want to tell them what to look for .
hey , dr. isles .
we &apos;re still sorting through junk .
nothing promising so far .
well , the murder weapon
is approximately the size of a baseball bat .
yeah , and it has a beehive attached to it .
a who ?
it has an edge that will look like a honeycomb .
so ... it &apos;s not robotman ?
you know what , frankie ?
why don &apos;t you try acting like a real detective ?
oh , you mean like this ?
out of my way ,
or i &apos;m gonna throw my extra @-@ hot triple latte on you !
oh , no ! please don &apos;t , officer !
wait a minute . how do you know about that ?
you haven &apos;t seen it ?
seen what ?
go on youtube .
okay .
okay , now type in
&quot; mean detective jane . &quot;
i didn &apos;t touch you at all .
it was on purpose .
you know what ? don &apos;t -- don &apos;t touch me again .
i didn &apos;t touch you at all .
what a bitch .
here , take mine .
wait . no . i didn &apos;t say that .
they must have lip @-@ dubbed you .
that is expert editing .
okay , wait , now you &apos;re an expert on viral videos , too ?
come on , it &apos;s funny .
it was on purpose .
you know what ? don &apos;t -- don &apos;t touch me again .
et tu , brute ?
well , it is kind of funny .
not if you &apos;re me .
hi , honey .
oh , yay . i &apos;m pregnant .
don &apos;t i have to have sex to be pregnant ?
okay , for heaven &apos;s sake ,
we had a party for darlene in accounting .
i thought you could use some cheering up .
why would i need cheering up ?
just because my video is more popular
than that monkey flinging his poop ?
so , you spilled a little coffee .
or threw it .
i did not throw it .
mm , in slo @-@ mo , it kind of looks like you might &apos;ve .
okay . i &apos;m going to leave this in case you want any later .
none for you .
thanks , ma .
okay , turn that off or i will throw darlene &apos;s cake at you .
what do we know about leroy ?
well ...
leroy was telling the truth .
he and daniel were friends .
leroy seems harmless . my gut says he &apos;s no killer .
yeah , me too .
but we &apos;re putting him in lockup with a bunch of creeps .
all right , so let &apos;s get him a psych eval ,
buy him some time in the hospital .
at least he &apos;ll stay alive .
good idea .
what about frost and frankie ?
they come up with the murder weapon yet ?
not yet .
stuff &apos;s coming into the crime lab for processing , though .
why don &apos;t we remove the pretty rookie
and they can get focused ?
another good idea .
i &apos;ll call it in .
echo 4 @-@ 0 @-@ 2 . i &apos;m off on an l @-@ 20 here .
frankie !
yeah .
frankie , look at this .
what is it ?
i think leroy made an e.m.p. gun .
an electromagnetic pulse gun ?
yeah , with an old @-@ school approach .
does it work ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe we should find out .
echo 4 @-@ 0 @-@ 2 . i &apos;m off on an l @-@ 20 here .
where you gonna aim it ?
uh , definitely not at the houses .
uh , maybe there ?
echo 4 @-@ 0 @-@ 2 . they want you back ...
go for it .
10 @-@ 4 . on my way .
hello ?
ah , i think we just took out
the electrical systems in the cruisers .
uh , that could be expensive .
let &apos;s get back in the basement .
oh , hey , you guys ?
uh , something just happened to the radio in my car .
weird .
oh , that happens all the time .
thought i did something .
just call the guys in the shop .
they &apos;ll take care of it .
okay . thanks .
why don &apos;t you talk to him , nice lady ?
hello , leroy .
is that my stuff ?
yes .
better all be there .
it was all inventoried ,
but why don &apos;t you check through it to make sure ?
i want to go home .
they &apos;re probably in there right now , taking my things .
mr. grovner , you understand you &apos;re not being released ?
the judge has ordered
that you have an evaluation at a hospital .
yeah , &apos; cause they all think i &apos;m -- i &apos;m crazy .
everyone thinks i &apos;m crazy . i &apos;m not crazy .
i believe you .
i &apos;ll do anything to prove i didn &apos;t kill daniel .
he wasn &apos;t stealing from me . it was someone else .
uh , can i borrow your notepad ?
thanks .
mr. grovner ,
why don &apos;t you describe to me the items that you &apos;re missing ?
um , my , uh , my circuit boards ,
a @-@ a @-@ and an antique bird cage , and hockey stuff .
circuit boards , antique ?
yeah .
bird cage .
hockey equipment .
my dad was an equipment manager for a hockey team .
saved all of it and gave it to me before he died .
yeah ?
okay .
i &apos;ll file an incident report
and see if i can get you your things back .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
why do you say that ?
i thought that you weren &apos;t a nice lady , but -- but you are .
thank you .
okay . come on , leroy .
you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
rizzoli .
yes , sir .
in my office -- now .
is it too late to call in sick ?
you want a union rep ?
why , do i need one ?
well ... you might .
excuse me . excuse me .
someone &apos;s in a bad mood .
just trying to get to work .
get away -- get away -- get away from me .
don &apos;t t @-@ t @-@ touch me .
b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ bitch .
it was an accident .
yeah , we all know that ,
but that woman says you gave her second @-@ degree burns .
oh , my god .
we have to investigate you .
what ? why ?
because she &apos;s filed a police @-@ brutality complaint against you .
it &apos;s not the end of the world .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;d be amazed if anybody outside bpd even saw it .
it has 79,000 hits , maura .
well , i &apos;ll bet you they &apos;re mostly europeans .
europeans ?
hey , coop .
hey , cooper .
hey -- coop , it &apos;s me . what ?
cooper .
he must be picking up on your anxiety .
my anxiety ?
yeah , we &apos;re late for mah @-@ jongg .

i &apos;m not gonna let her spill anything on you , i promise .
so , ms. billings is european ?
oh , hey , look .
it &apos;s that cop that throws coffee at people .
hey , all right , move along .
oh , yeah .

okay , that &apos;s harassment .
oh , yeah ? why don &apos;t you come arrest me ?
no , ignore him . come on .
i just want to take a shower .
just want to take a shower . that &apos;s it .
yo , sista .
did gilbert fix my water ?
gil is cool .
tommy , did he fix my water ?
i don &apos;t think so .
he had to take another call , but he did do that .
tommy ! how could you let him do that ?
there &apos;s a leak in the building , jane .
it might even be black mold .
think we &apos;ll have to wear those mask thingies ?
i don &apos;t see any signs of mold .
how am i supposed to take a shower ?
jane , come on . you can stay at my place .
gil was asking about you . i think he likes you .
swell .
oh , oh , here it is . here it is .
and if you think you &apos;ve had a bad day ,
be glad you &apos;re not boston detective jane rizzoli ,
who finds herself in hot water
after spilling scalding coffee on a stranger .
is he ? is that ?
we talked to her brother
to find out if there is more to this story .
oh , jane has a temper , all right .
oh , yeah . when we were growing up ,
nobody messed with us ,
&apos;cause if they did , jane would kick the crap out of them .
you did an interview in my apartment ?
thought this was a condo .
in my apartment ? !
i @-@ i mean , i said a lot of nice things about you .
tommy !
they must &apos;ve cut them out .
why would you -- get out .
get out now ! get out now .
jane rizzoli ?
yes .
you &apos;ve been served .
i can &apos;t -- i ...
she sued me .
goodbye .
vince ... thanks for coming .
sure . is she here ?
yep .
upstairs taking a shower .
this lawsuit looks like a boiler plate .
thought they filed it fast .
boiler plate ? so , it &apos;s bullshit ?
sorry , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m upset .
you &apos;re right .
you never know what a jury will do .
poor jane .
you know , i liked it better
before the computer media cloud stuff .
me , too . you could have a conversation .
you want some coffee ?
love some .
you want a little irish whiskey in it ?
sure , but skip the coffee .
half a million bucks ? that &apos;s what she wants ?
can you believe it ?
vince , jane doesn &apos;t have that kind of money
unless she sells her condo .
it won &apos;t come to that .
she was on the job .
the city has to cover legal costs .
well , i &apos;m still gonna help her .
you &apos;re a good mom .
oh , i didn &apos;t know you were in here .
my back hurts .
high cortisol levels from stress .
why would i be stressed ?
just a coffee @-@ throwing b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ bitch .
stop . it was one moment in a life .
one moment caught on tape .
well , let it go . ujjayi breath .
&quot; ooh @-@ jie &quot; who ?
it &apos;s a deep , cleansing breath .
just focus on the present .
i &apos;m trying , but you &apos;re vibrating .
it &apos;s susie .
the particulate found in the victim &apos;s head wound
was fiber @-@ reinforced polymer .
is that animal , vegetable , or mineral ?
mineral .
it &apos;s a fine mixture of glass , carbon , and basalt .
and what &apos;s that used for ?
high @-@ tech applications .
it &apos;s used as a structural component
in everything from skyscrapers to aircraft .
high @-@ tech murder weapon .
wonder if leroy found something and drug it into his basement .
you &apos;re a very good detective .
and a very good person ...
once you &apos;ve had your coffee .
yeah , i let the little things get to me today .
we all do , jane .
just take a deep breath and stay in the present .
why does work always know
when i &apos;m trying to stay in the present ?
rizzoli .
what ? when ?
all right , get two more uniforms over there .
thanks .
what is it ?
somebody tried to break into leroy &apos;s basement .
all right , thank you .
morning .
that was the sergeant at the crime scene .
they kept the flood lights on all night .
so far , so good .
that &apos;s got to be our killer , don &apos;t you think ?
and what is so valuable in there
that you would risk getting caught ?
good thing the guys on watch were paying attention .
maybe daniel was down there looking for the same thing ,
and that &apos;s why he &apos;s dead .
who left these here ?
i don &apos;t know , but they &apos;ll get sick of teasing you pretty soon .
ooh , it &apos;s still hot .
thank you .
it &apos;s very thoughtful .
did , uh , frost and frankie find anything
that could be the murder weapon ?
maybe . you said high @-@ tech ?
they found something .
csru is bringing it in for maura to have a look at .
all right , this is maura .
she &apos;s confirmed it &apos;s made of fiber @-@ reinforced polymer --
the same stuff she found in the victim &apos;s head wound .
sounds like our murder weapon .
yeah .
you want to be claire or maura ?
doesn &apos;t matter , as long as you don &apos;t throw the other one at me .
good one .
thank you .
any idea what it is ?
i &apos;m not sure .
it looks pretty small to be the murder weapon .
it &apos;s not the murder weapon ,
but it might be made of the same materials .
yeah . it &apos;s really light .
stiffness and strength at a very low weight .
it &apos;s because of this .
you see the honeycomb @-@ like structure ?
yeah , it looks like the marks
that were pounded into daniel &apos;s head .
now , what the hell is it ?
you know , whatever it is , it &apos;s made of highly complex
and a unique combination of materials .
you said high @-@ tech applications ?
mm @-@ hmm . i mean , it &apos;s a long shot ,
but what if we did a patent search ,
find out what we &apos;re looking for ?
two days in a hoarder &apos;s basement .
i &apos;m officially claustrophobic .
ah , we &apos;re almost done .
i don &apos;t believe this .
b.o. , number 4 ?
do you know whose skate this is ?
can &apos;t be .
no .
it &apos;s the right size .
did we just find bobby orr &apos;s skate ?
i think we did .
hey , wait .
you remember that neighbor guy who tried to bring us lemonade ?
yeah . yeah , and he had that story
about lending leroy his hockey skates .
what guy brings lemonade ?
you &apos;re right .
and if this really is bobby orr &apos;s skate ,
it &apos;s crazy valuable .
what if leroy &apos;s neighbor was stealing something
from the basement when the garbage man surprised him ?
maybe friendly neighbor
is really friendly neighborhood murderer .
which means we &apos;re looking for the murder weapon
in the wrong house .
that &apos;s him -- mac hazlet .
he &apos;s quite the successful ebay entrepreneur .
antiques , collectibles , hockey memorabilia .
started raking it in about six months ago .
leroy broke his hip six months ago .
frost , see if you can find the e.r. admissions report .
you thinking mac discovered
leroy &apos;s antiques road show in his basement
and started stealing his stuff ?
yep .
wow . was mac .
he &apos;s listed on the report .
says he heard leroy &apos;s cries for help and called 911 .
you know something ?
mac needs to pick on someone his own age .
you sold terry o &apos;reilly &apos;s hockey glove ,
phil esposito &apos;s stick .
you just listed one of bobby orr &apos;s skates .
the left one .
i wonder where the right one is .
be a lot more valuable as a pair .
i &apos;m a big bruins fan .
where do you find this great stuff ?
um , uh , here and there .
uh , flea markets , private collectors .
so , not next door in leroy &apos;s basement ?
i took a few things .
i mean , you know , it was just sitting there collecting dust .
i @-@ i wanted to put it
in the hands of guys like you who really appreciate it .
oh , that was really nice of him , wasn &apos;t it , sergeant ?
it sure was .
what do you think that murder weapon you have would be worth
to somebody that collects that kind of stuff ?
what murder weapon ?
the metal club you used to kill the garbage man .
i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
our colleagues are tearing apart your house as we speak .
you can &apos;t do that .
a judge said we can .
you could make it easy on everyone .
just tell us where the murder weapon is .
i @-@ i &apos;m not telling you crap .
you &apos;re under arrest for larceny .
7 : 59 a.m.
do you know what that means ?
it was one minute before 8 : 00 ?
and what time do you go on duty ?
8 : 00 .
the good news is , this is no longer a police @-@ brutality case .
oh , that is good news .
what &apos;s the bad news ?
it &apos;s a civil matter .
and because you weren &apos;t on the clock ,
the city &apos;s refusing to indemnify you .
you can &apos;t be serious .
so i &apos;m on my own ?
look at that -- another 17 cents .
i wonder if f. lee bailey will take your case now .
if i tell him to shut up ,
do you think he &apos;ll put it on youtube ?
i wouldn &apos;t put it past him .
okay , where &apos;s maura ?
i want to know what that lawyer said .
well ?
i brought matcha tea .
it &apos;s from utashinai . you want to try some ?
maura , what did he say ?
oh , look , another 50 cents .
rizzoli , get over here and help your customers .
yes , mr. stanley .
okay , just tell me what he said .
he said it would be expensive to defend .
i just spilled coffee .
i know .
it &apos;s a frivolous lawsuit , but he looked at the video ,
and if she has medical expenses or compensatory damages --
for crying out loud .
just -- how much is it to hire him ?
he wants a $ 25,000 retainer .
oh , my god .
maura , every cent i have is in my condo .
i know .
i could live in leroy &apos;s basement .
oh , come on . let me help you .
you know , i &apos;ll just cash out some mutual funds .
no . i can &apos;t take your money .
don &apos;t look at that .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna lose my home over this .
maura , look at her blouse .
they can manufacture an artificial heart ,
but they can &apos;t get a polyester blend to drape properly .
no .
that .
you see it now ?
her blouse is repelling the droplets of coffee .
wait , that could be made of a scald @-@ proof nanofabric .
help for the fashion @-@ challenged .
teflon @-@ nanotube coating is used on some textiles
to produce scald @-@ proof fabrics .
so , she set it up .
she even had somebody there to tape it .
you think she wanted you to spill your coffee
so she could sue ?
but how &apos;d she know you were a cop ?
i &apos;ll be damned .
what ? what do you see ?
whirls and ridges .
whoever videotaped it left a fingerprint on the camera lens .
we should run that .
yes !
yes !
oh , yes !
i found the patent .
i know what this is .
it &apos;s a piece of a new type of rotor blade from a drone .
from a drone ?
yeah . manufactured by jfp .
jarvis flight project .
that would explain the honeycomb interior .
and the edge of the rotor blade
is consistent with the wound pattern .
how does a piece of a drone end up in leroy &apos;s basement ?
maybe he dragged it inside
after he shot it down with the bug zapper .
e.m.p. would destroy the drone &apos;s electronic system --
probably cause a power outage , too .
yeah , but do we know if that even works ?
oh , yeah . it works .
really ?
how do you know that ?
well --
have anything to do with the two cruisers
who got their brains fried at the crime scene ?
i think i &apos;ll take the fifth .
drones can be used for corporate espionage .
and leroy was convinced that he was being watched , spied on .
spy on an old man &apos;s house with a million @-@ dollar drone ?
maybe they were spying on the neighborhood .
frontload tech just moved its r &amp; d offices right nearby .
yeah , but there would be a ton of firewalls
to protect proprietary information .
yeah , but look at all these houses sold .
frost , who lives around leroy ?
frontload tech engineers .
a lot of them .
that &apos;s it .
you take your phone and your computer home .
if i wanted to steal ,
i would send a drone , fly it over your home .
it was doing a war @-@ drive --
piggybacking on wi @-@ fi networks and downloading everything .
frost , look up jfp &apos;s website .
got it right here .
what else does jfp do ?
they offer intelligence @-@ gathering services .
look who &apos;s head of the division .
we saw him outside leroy &apos;s house at the standoff .
jim blackman -- former navy seal ,
specializes in military @-@ intelligence gathering .
said he was a neighbor .
yeah , except he lives 20 miles away .
could you track the drone sent out back to leroy &apos;s basement ?
yes . it had a gps locator .
this is a picture of jim at the crime scene .
he told me he had to get to the office ,
but he looks a hell of a lot more interested
about what &apos;s going on inside leroy &apos;s house
than he does in getting to work .
the break @-@ in last night .
it was a huge risk , but there must be something inside that house
that ties him to the murder .
but what ?
i mean , we went through everything .
what did leroy have in his pockets when we brought him in ?
69 cents , package of tums , a rabbit &apos;s foot .
and a miniature hard drive .
can you punch in on that ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s hard to see ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s stamped &quot; jfp . &quot;
jfp -- jim blackman &apos;s drone @-@ manufacturing company .
we need to find jim .
i &apos;m gonna make sure leroy &apos;s safe first .
hey , this is detective rizzoli .
i need a status report on leroy grovner .
he &apos;s been released .
clear .
put it down -- please !
i don &apos;t know what you want .
where &apos;s the hard drive you stole ?
stop it .
tell me where it is !
leave me alone !
you &apos;re the reason your friend is dead .
you shouldn &apos;t have killed daniel .
and you shouldn &apos;t have shot down my drone and taken it apart .
now , where is it ?
where &apos;s the hard drive you stole ?
police have it .
you &apos;re a liar !
you tell me where it is or you &apos;re a dead man .
jim , it &apos;s over . put the gun down .
no . don &apos;t move or i &apos;ll blow the old man &apos;s head off .
let &apos;s all just calm down .
like i said , jim , it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m not going down . i &apos;m gonna take you with me .
what ? with leroy &apos;s shotgun ?
damn straight .
leroy , you load that like you did before ?
sure did .
you &apos;re a military man , jim .
you ought to recognize the difference
between live ammo and blanks .
that &apos;s for daniel , you miserable yo @-@ yo .
come on , jim .
quit your whining .
leroy , you okay ?
all my stuff .
my whole -- my whole life .
it &apos;s all -- it &apos;s all gone .
i @-@ it &apos;s not gone , leroy .
we &apos;ll get your stuff back .
yeah .
we got a hit on that fingerprint .
you recognize that name ?
yeah . i sure do .
i was thinking desert tones with a pop of cactus green .
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re a little too far east
for a southwest decor .
especially in a historic building .
jane , i @-@ i can explain .
to a judge .
what ? you did this for my condo ?
that &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s even crazier
to leave your fingerprints on the camera lens ,
and that &apos;s all over youtube , too .
it was , uh , gil &apos;s idea .
i was happy living on the ground floor .
oh , right .
&quot; baby , please , could we convert the third floor ?
&quot; it &apos;s the nicest spot in the building .
please , please , please ? &quot;
i do not talk like that .
you see what i &apos;m dealing with ?
okay . we &apos;ll get you separate cells .
you &apos;re under arrest for fraud .
i cannot believe i hooked up with you !
you hooked up with me . right .
hold on , i want to show you something .
come here .
what ?
if i &apos;m in it , i don &apos;t want to see it .
i &apos;m sorry .
why do you say that ?
i @-@ i thought you weren &apos;t a @-@ a nice lady , but -- but you are .
you know , we live in a dual @-@ party consent state .
i could sue you for secretly taping me .
go ahead and try . i have a good attorney .
it has 11 hits , maura .
give it some time .
what ? for the &quot; europeans &quot; to discover it ?
okay , maybe we need to spice it up , add a little music .
yeah . we can dub in &quot; b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ bitch ! &quot;
that was good . i could rap for you .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s spitting . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not rapping .
that &apos;s what they do .
no . no .
here . you &apos;re all right .
got some-- -do i have --
