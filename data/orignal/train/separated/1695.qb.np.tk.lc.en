why hast thou forsaken me , o deity whose existence i doubt ?
here . breathe into this bag .
what &apos;s going on ?
they stole everything , leonard !
everything .
are you the roommate ?
yeah , leonard hofstadter . what happened ?
your friend here called 911 to report a robbery .
oh , my god , what did they get ?
what didn &apos;t they get ?
they got my enchanted weapons ,
my vicious gladiator armor ,
my wand of untainted power ,
and all my gold !
you called the police
because someone hacked your world of warcraft account ?
what choice did i have ?
the mighty sheldor , level 85 blood elf ,
hero of the eastern kingdoms ,
has been picked clean , like a carcass in the desert sun .
plus , the fbi hung up on me .
into the bag .
they took my battle ostrich !
oh , no , not glenn !
yes !
glenn !
the only bird i ever loved .
good luck , fellas .
oh . well , thank you , officer .
wait a minute !
you &apos;re not going to do anything ?
mr. cooper , there &apos;s nothing ...
dr. cooper .
seriously ?
not the kind with access to drugs .
fine . dr. cooper .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss ,
but the pasadena police department
doesn &apos;t have jurisdiction in ...
pandora .
that &apos;s from &lt; i &gt; avatar &lt; / i &gt; !
world of warcraft takes place in azeroth .
goodness gracious , how are you allowed to carry a gun ?
can you at least refer me to a rogue ex @-@ cop ?
what ?
wh-- you know , one who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules ,
and now he hires himself out
to impose his own brand of rough justice ?
no .
thank you , officer .
it &apos;s all gone . &lt; i &gt; all &lt; / i &gt; gone .
i &apos;m really sorry , sheldon .
what kind of world do we live in ,
where a man would take another man &apos;s battle ostrich ?
i don &apos;t know .
this act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity .
it is time to cry havoc , and let slip the dogs of war .
i &apos;m on it .
hi , mrs. wolowitz . is , is howard there ?
okay , thanks .
that particular dog of war
will have to call you back after his bath .
see if raj is done with pilates .
three thousand hours .
three thousand hours clicking on that mouse ,
collecting weapons and gold .
it &apos;s almost as if it was a huge waste of time .
whoever did this knew what they were doing .
he got in and out of your account in under
15 minutes , transferred all your stuff ,
and didn &apos;t leave a digital fingerprint .
oh !
there isn &apos;t enough chamomile tea in the world
to quell the rage in my heart .
hold on . i &apos;m talking to an orc
under the bridge in thunder bluff
who says if we pay him , he &apos;ll help us track down your things .
can we trust him ?
i should say so ; he appears to be a member
of the nigerian royal family .
whoa ! somebody &apos;s auctioning off a jeweled ostrich bridle !
no . glenn &apos;s was leather .
he was a simple ostrich .
is ! is , i haven &apos;t given up hope .
hey .
hey , penny . we &apos;re kind of in the middle of a crisis , here .
oh , i know . bernadette told me .
sorry , sheldon . i know that game meant a lot to you .
what-- &quot; that game &quot; ?
excuse me , penny , but doodle jump is a game .
angry birds is a game .
world of warcraft is a
massively multi @-@ player online role @-@ playing ...
all right , technically it &apos;s a game .
bad news , the nigerian prince may be a fraud .
okay , well , anyways , i brought you
a day @-@ old cheesecake to cheer you up !
stale pastry is hollow succor
to a man who is bereft of ostrich .
just say &quot; thank you . &quot;
i thought i just did .
all right . see you later .
oh ! hello .
oh , hi !
i was just dropping off a cheesecake to sheldon .
he was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap
that &apos;s useful in a make @-@ believe place .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
yeah , well , sadly , i do .
did you know last weekend priya took leonard
rollerblading at the beach ?
can you believe that ?
i feel like i &apos;m supposed to say &quot; that bitch , &quot;
but i don &apos;t have enough information .
i am the one who spent two years
trying to get him to even
go to the beach in the first place .
and he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste ,
i had to carry him to the water .
i took howard to the beach once .
he almost burst into flames like a vampire .
so what &apos;s the thanks i get for turning leonard
into quality boyfriend material ?
i have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend .
i think you &apos;re on .
that bitch !
want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream ?
ah , here &apos;s the alcohol and drug peer pressure
mother warned me about .
i was starting to think it was never going to happen .
yes , please .
you guys should &apos;ve seen leonard when i first met him .
there was no eye contact .
he was either looking up at the ceiling ,
or down at his shoes .
i &apos;m drunk .
you know , for the first couple of months ,
whenever i would take off my bra ,
he would giggle and say , &quot; oh , boy , my breast friends &quot; !
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
i &apos;m never speaking to priya again .
no , don &apos;t do that .
no reason to be mean to her .
this may be the alcohol talking ...
but i believe there is .
are you familiar with the recent study
of tanzanian chimpanzees by nishida and hosaka
out of kyoto university ?
no , but i can name all the kardashians .
primates , such as ourselves , have a natural instinct
to ostracize ill @-@ mannered members of the troop .
bernadette &apos;s urge to
shun , scowl or fling her waste at priya
is hard @-@ wired into her dna .
i don &apos;t have an urge to fling my waste .
believe me , it &apos;s there , we all have it .
hit me with some more booze , and i &apos;ll show you .
all right , here we are -- this is the tavern
where all the black @-@ market weapon trades go down .
i don &apos;t think my character should be in a place like this .
everyone &apos;s undressing her with their eyes .
maybe if you stop dropping your sword
and bending over to pick it up .
okay , what exactly are we looking for ?
redheaded troll , goes by the name of glumly .
according to the message boards ,
if you want to move stolen goods
and it &apos;s after school hours , he &apos;s your guy .
leonard , is this going to take much longer ?
i thought we were going to spend some time together .
uh , we are . in the meantime ,
you &apos;re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us .
seriously ?
well , you have to put in a credit card number ,
but it &apos;s fun .
maybe i should just go home .
our troll just walked in ! i got him !
we got him . we &apos;re almost done .
so , how do you guys want to play this ?
be ruthless . you tell him
if he doesn &apos;t start talking , we &apos;ll register a complaint
with his internet service provider .
sheldon , what if he gets his internet
from his cable company ?
he could lose his hbo
and all their delightful original programming .
i don &apos;t care ! i &apos;m losin &apos; it , man !
why don &apos;t we play this smart ?
try a little &quot; good goblin , bad goblin . &quot;
oh , dear lord .
nah , i think we have to be more subtle .
okay , i see where this is going .
fine , i &apos;ll have sex with him .
that &apos;s not where it was going .
good , because i would hate that .
leonard , you &apos;re busy-- let &apos;s talk tomorrow .
oh , wait . hang on . are you upset ?
no , no , i think it &apos;s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man &apos;s body .
good , good .
i &apos;ll tell you what happens .
and people think i don &apos;t get sarcasm .
well , well , well .
look who it is .
okay , be nice .
hello .
hi . we &apos;re just heading out for a drink .
because i do that now .
count your blessings
you &apos;re not a tanzanian chimp .
what ?
don &apos;t listen to her--
she &apos;s had a lot of ice cream .
do you want to join us ?
oh , thank you , but i have work to do .
four women walk down the stairs--
how many reach the lobby ?
did your sister say anything when you got home last night ?
oh , no , don &apos;t put me in the middle of this .
i &apos;m not going to be your go @-@ between .
come on , help me out .
am i in trouble ?
there &apos;s no reason to worry .
that &apos;s a relief .
i &apos;m sure many women
in happy relationships spend their nights
skyping with their ex @-@ boyfriend sanjay .
good news , gentlemen-- i found our hacker .
what ? really ?
yeah . no one can hide from me ,
not waldo , not carmen san diego ,
not even topless natalie portman .
i &apos;ve never said these words before ,
but good job , howard !
thanks . our culprit is one mr. todd zarnecki ,
2711 ocean view road ,
carlsbad , california .
the name and the address drip with evil .
what else do we know about him ?
why , quite a bit , actually .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s some loser who lives with his parents .
yes , he does live with his parents .
here &apos;s a google earth shot of their house .
excellent ! it &apos;s in a cul @-@ de @-@ sac .
we can box him in .
hold on , you &apos;re thinking of going there ?
carlsbad is only a couple of hours away .
fine .
you walk up to the house , knock on the door
and demand your stuff back . what if he says no ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve been following the news , leonard ,
but there have been some terrific advancements
in the field of torture .
no one &apos;s getting tortured .
fine , we &apos;ll abide by the geneva convention .
but ask yourself this :
in the course of our lives ,
how much lunch money has been taken from us ?
how many kites ?
how many scooby @-@ doo trapper keepers ?
i totally had one of those .
of course you did .
it was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work .
but the bullies took it from us .
well , no more .
tonight , we take back our dignity ,
our birthright and our pride .
what do you say ?
who &apos;s with me ?
i have a hip @-@ hop aerobics class at 5 : 00 ; could we go after ?
sure .
also , tonight &apos;s the sabbath
and my mother and i have a tradition of
lighting the candles and watching wheel of fortune , so ...
if we could leave at 8 : 00,
we &apos;d still be able to
regain our birthright at 10 : 00 , 10 : 30 latest .
fine .
leonard ?
oh , geez , i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i can ditch priya
two nights in a row .
oh , come on , man .
bros before ...
... my sister .
aw , screw it .
i &apos;m in .
me , too .
and me .
one moment .
i &apos;m hell @-@ bent on catching a cyber criminal ,
not the common cold .
i &apos;m sorry , i thought this delay was
so you could watch &lt; i &gt; wheel of &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; fortune &lt; / i &gt; with your mother .
i am .
she &apos;s just bleaching her mustache .
check it out .
hey , ma ! &quot; before and after ! &quot;
four words , 17 letters , two n &apos;s , one v !
&quot; fanny pack of wolves ! &quot;
that &apos;s incredible .
yeah , she &apos;s kind of a &lt; i &gt; wheel &lt; / i &gt; savant .
uh @-@ oh , that &apos;s priya .
sitar music for her ringtone is not cool , dude .
hit the ...
hey , sweetie .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna be working late .
yeah , i @-@ i miss you , too .
okay , sure , i &apos;ll call you when i get home .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
very nice .
you lie to my sister .
that &apos;s the nicest thing he does to your sister .
oh , guess who .
cover for me .
hello , priya . what &apos;s up ?
how would i know if leonard &apos;s at work or not ?
don &apos;t be suspicious .
look , if you want your relationship with leonard
to continue , you &apos;re going to have to believe
whatever wild @-@ eyed , cockamamie excuse
the white devil has the nerve to offer you .
okay ? yeah , bye @-@ bye .
you owe me .
new puzzle , ma !
&quot; same name &quot; !
one n , two d &apos;s , three o &apos;s !
whoopi and rube goldberg !
that &apos;s uncanny .
i know . it &apos;s her superpower .
well , that and jiggling her arm fat .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re going all the way to san diego
to confront this guy .
yeah , we &apos;re kind of bad @-@ asses , aren &apos;t we ?
totally .
hey , how about we stay the night
and hit legoland in the morning ?
sea world is better .
it has shamu , who is literally tons of fun .
but for the moment , let &apos;s stay focused on todd zarnecki .
yeah , we &apos;re coming for you , todd zarnecki .
and for the record , legoland is more interactive .
i almost feel sorry for the poor fool ,
sitting in his split @-@ level suburban ranch ,
unaware that a vengeful horde
is barreling down the san diego freeway
at 71 miles an hour .
ease up there , lead foot .
you trying to get us killed ?
i took the liberty of burning us
a mix of heroic questing music .
this says &quot; beyonce bootylicious dance mix . &quot;
it &apos;s a re @-@ writable cd .
just put it in .
beyonce ? really ?
she &apos;s curvy and she owns it .
i like that .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m feeling it .
we are winged fury !
which is still no excuse
for going over the posted speed limit .
next time we go to kick someone &apos;s ass ,
we take the train .
i always prefer the train .
sheldon , let &apos;s go .
coming .
why did you bring that ?
no weapon strikes more fear into a man &apos;s heart
than a klingon bat &apos;leth .
okay , let &apos;s get clear on something .
we &apos;re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of
your stuff back into your account and then be on our way .
no one &apos;s bat &apos;lething anybody .
so my blade shall not taste blood tonight ?
no .
well , now i just feel silly holding it .
come on .
can i at least kick down the door ?
you &apos;re welcome to try , but the other day ,
it took you 15 minutes to get into a fedex box .
who is it ?
your doom !
don &apos;t say &quot; your doom . &quot;
who opens the door for their doom ?
good point .
basket of puppies .
what ?
uh ...
sheldon ?
are you todd zarnecki ?
yeah . who are you ?
i am sheldor of azeroth .
i want my things back .
i don &apos;t think so .
let me see that .
careful . that &apos;s a collectible .
i know .
i &apos;ve always wanted one .
well , he &apos;s even more cunning than we thought .
you know , the joke &apos;s on him .
without the certificate of authenticity ,
that bat &apos;leth is worthless .
yeah , he walked right into our trap .
legoland seems like a hollow dream now .
uh @-@ oh .
what &apos;s the matter ?
something &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m not getting any gas .
anybody know anything about internal combustion engines ?
of course .
19th @-@ century technology .
very basic .
does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine ?
no .
no .
not a clue .
well , we &apos;d better call somebody to come pick us up .
it &apos;d be swell if they had a train .
thank you , penny .
no problem .
so , leonard ,
i think it &apos;s interesting you didn &apos;t call your girlfriend
to come get you .
uh , i kind of told her i was working .
so you lied to her .
also interesting .
yeah , she doesn &apos;t really understand
the whole warcraft adventure @-@ role @-@ playing thing .
well , doesn &apos;t matter if she gets it , as long as she &apos;s pretty .
this one &apos;s funny , leonard .
how come you couldn &apos;t make it work with her ?
so did you at least get sheldon &apos;s fake stuff back ?
no . we failed in our noble quest .
how come ?
todd zarnecki was mean .
all right . hang on .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna show you how we finish a quest in nebraska .
oh . beyonce .
this ain &apos;t no beyonce .
now what ?
give my friend his stuff back .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
well , then , good news .
today &apos;s the day a girl &apos;s finally going to touch you
in your little special place .
now give him his stuff back .
okay .
we did it !
i said , &quot; we . &quot;
oh , hold the door .
oh , hi .
hi .
going to see leonard ?
yes .
how have you been ?
fine . you ?
very well , thank you .
all right , well , great seeing you .
yeah . you , too .
amy &apos;s right .
i do want to fling my poop at her .
