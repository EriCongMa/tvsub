Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Medina.
The eve before trial-- always a nightmare.
You've met Kalinda?
No.
I'm Kalinda.
Hal Peterman speaks highly of you.
He says you helped him
on the Michigan River killings.
And our client suggested we meet.
Yes, I've met Mr. Bauer.
I like him.
I do, too.
It's just that we already have a jury consultant,
and actually, we already have a jury.
I know. I don't pick juries.
Oh. Then, what do you do?
I read a jury's micro-expressions
to make sure that you are persuading them... or not.
Micro-expressions?
Uh, fleeting emotional displays
revealing a person's true feelings.
And how much
do you charge for this... service?
$60,000 a week.
Or $250,000 for the full trial.
Can we try a test?
Sure.
What does this micro-expression mean?
It's prejudicial.
So you think the prosecution
won't try to admit it?
I know they will.
But the judge will see your job
is irrelevant to the crime.
Just... people hate what I do.
Spam. Search engine optimization.
Don't worry.
The prosecution will be too busy shoring up motive.
They need to show that you killed your father
to keep him from changing his will.
My dad was my best friend.
I would never hurt him.
Get a good night's sleep.
It's good to have you back.
Thanks.
I heard a lot happened.
60 grand a week.
Contract him for two.
And stop by my office afterwards.
I have a quick thing on Stanton.
Sure.
Really?
A jury whisperer?
Hey, if the client wants to pay.
Use him as a tool.
Do you have a second?
You need to talk to Diane.
I think you already know I did talk to Diane.
I know you threatened to bar her from her office,
with security guards.
Diane is going out on her own.
She's poaching clients, partners--
What would you do?
Calm her.
We need to keep her on the reservation
for two more months.
Why?
I'm bringing in an independent expenditure only committee.
A super PAC?
Yes. One of the biggest.
$100 million of unlimited corporate spending.
But we need to stay whole another two months.
We can't scare them off with civil war.
And after two months?
We push her out.
So, calm the waters.
Keep Diane from leaving.
I'm leaving.
You're leaving?
Okay. Where are you leaving?
Lockhart/Gardner.
Do you need references?
I made a mistake, Cary, letting you go.
I've watched you grow
at the state's attorney's office,
and I have to admit... I've been awestruck.
I like the state's attorney's office.
I know you do. It's a good boot camp.
But at a certain point,
you need to get back in the game.
You don't think I'm in the game?
I don't think you're being paid as if you're in the game.
I'm starting a new firm--
with David Lee, Julius Cain--
and I want to offer you a key seat at the table.
How key?
Senior associate.
Two-year path to equity partnership.
Who else is going?
Samuels...
Hunter, Bachner,
Mazin.
Kalinda?
I don't know.
She plays it close to the vest,
but, um... she's unhappy.
Alicia?
I... I asked her.
My guess is she stays with Will.
I'll consider it.
Good.
I need to know in a week.
Is that doable?
Very.
Good luck in court tomorrow.
I don't know why we're having this conversation.
Really.
Just the polling. Nothing else.
The candidate's here?
Yeah.
Eli, come over here.
Eli, meet Adam. Adam, Eli.
Ah. Eli Gold,
"The terror of Michigan Avenue."
Uh, just dropping by for a visit?
A visit with gifts.
Oh, God...
What was her name?
It was, uh, Melissa...
Melissa! Advance team in 2004.
Ah, this girl right out of NYU--
she brought in chili and gave everybody food poisoning.
I mean, people...
people were puking for days. Anyway...
Adam's got some ideas for fund-raising.
Really?
Yeah, well, I... I heard you were struggling a bit.
Momentarily.
Yeah, but it's the impression.
And you know how impressions
become facts with big donors.
Adam did some good work for me on my first run,
and I just thought he could do the same here.
I mean, that is, if it works for you two.
I'm just here to help... not get in your way.
It's Republican money.
You don't know that.
I know that.
They want you to play spoiler.
They want to damage the Democrats going into fall.
He's not coming in above you, Eli.
That's not what this is about.
Yes, it is-- and I'm telling you right now--
I am looking you in the eye-- you are the boss.
Adam Boras works for you.
But we need cash, right now, or it's over.
And if there are strings attached?
We say, "No, thank you."
And we hold our heads high when we lose.
Make this happen.
Oh, good. You're on time.
What are you doing, playing dress-up?
We're a little bit behind on the Stanton suit,
so I'm going to need you to help the associates,
run some background checks today.
Did you hear me?
They're real?
Yes. Reading glasses.
Look, you tell Bond to call me in an hour.
Kalinda, I don't think you're getting this.
I assigned you a task:
help the associates on Stanton. I need it done now.
Look, we've had our fun and games,
but it's over.
I've been made your supervisor.
You know what? That's good.
That's good. Have a laugh.
Have a... have a big laugh, okay?
And go outside, and then compose yourself.
And then come back in, ready to work.
Thank you.
For what?
Your client didn't want to be written out of a will,
so he pushed his rich father out of a 12th-floor window.
Have you seen these photos?
Yeah, and they look pretty prejudicial to me.
My guess is the jury never sees them.
You now what they did in Roman times
to people who killed their fathers?
Put them in a sack with a snake, a chicken and a dog,
and threw them in a river.
Are we really plea-bargaining down from Roman times?
What'll you give me, just a chicken?
Bauer confesses to his father's murder,
and we'll bump it down to...
Twenty-five.
Twenty-five years.
Now, that's a good day's work for Gardner, Bond.
Hey, hold on one second, Cary.
Your Honor!
No, His Honor Weldon.
That's why we're plea-bargaining
during the middle of your game.
I'm sorry, Cary. Could you hold on one more second?
Your Honor, it's your day to collect cell phones.
Girlfriend?
Yeah. Her place or mine.
Real negotiation.
I'll be right with you, honey.
Think that chicken in the sack's
looking pretty good about now, Cicero.
Let's talk manslaughter. Two years.
We can get a recusal.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Judges love to be asked to recuse themselves
on the first day of trial.
We'll take it to the chief judge.
Hold on. I think he's here, too.
And don't get all outraged.
The State's Attorney plays poker
with half the judges in Cook County.
And Ms. Pine,
you play tennis with Chief Adler, don't you?
Look, Cary, I'll be playing for the next two hours.
Phone my cell, or we're going to court.
We can offer second-degree.
No.
A year ago, this guy killed a man,
and the jury will see that.
And Judge Weldon?
Will's playing basketball with him, that's all.
Unless he can play with the whole jury,
I say we trust the evidence.
Okay.
I'm sorry. You were saying something about skills?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
At least look like you're trying.
What, you afraid to D me up?
Ball in.
You're going to guard me now, Will?
I'll guard you.
You'll try.
What the hell was that?
What? You said to guard you.
I didn't say mug me!
You want to call the foul, call the foul.
Ball up.
Hey, sorry about that back there.
I got a little carried away. No second gear.
We're good, right?
Just messing with you.
Yeah, we're good. We're good.
You sure?
Yes. What, you want me not to be?
No, no. As long as we're cool.
Let's go.
No, no, I... I think I'm a bit tired.
I'm heading home.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me?
Don't make this harder.
No, I literally didn't hear what you said.
I'm sorry that I threatened to bar you from work.
I'm sorry that I lost my cool.
So what do we do?
I don't want you to leave.
I want to make things different, so you don't leave.
You'll stop seeing other women?
So what do you want?
I want transparency.
I want us to share our client lists.
Share, as in...?
Meetings, calls... everything.
Now, that would worry me if you were leaving,
because that would mean you have time
to solicit my clients.
So it's a good thing I'm not leaving.
As you can see, Your Honor,
they're highly prejudicial.
And highly accurate.
Overruled.
It's best evidence. What else?
Sorry, Your Honor. I was, delayed.
Let the record reflect that Mr. Gardner
has joined our little party.
Anything else, counselors?
Your Honor, we believe our client's profession
is irrelevant to this crime.
And every reference to it would be prejudicial.
We agree,
and we will make no such reference.
Good. Agreement. How refreshing.
But we ask for the inclusion of evidence of the defendant's drinking.
He's denied this.
Yes, and we would argue
this denial is why the victim threatened to write your client out of his will.
We ask to include photographic evidence
of the defendant with an alcoholic beverage.
When was this?
A World War II reenactment, October 2009.
We found this photograph during a search
of the defendant's apartment.
Objection, Your Honor.
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that not your client holding a beer?
Yes, and we would stipulate
he had the occasional beer, but...
Well, we don't have to stipulate.
We have a photograph proving it.
Your Honor, our client is a World War II buff.
It's just his hobby. But without context...
Then we suggest the defense give it context.
Your Honor, this is not about drinking.
This is about playing on a jury's bias.
This is about seeing our client as a Nazi.
I think the jury is smart enough to distinguish
between a World War II buff and a murderer. Overruled.
Let's get this started.
There was no sign of forced entry.
There was blood from the victim on the balcony, here.
And the victim was discovered 12 stories below.
Why did you arrest Mr. Bauer?
Forensic technicians found DNA
under the victim's fingernails, which matched mr. Scott Bauer.
Neighbors had also complained of hearing an argument
between Mr. Bauer and his father.
And then you searched Mr. Bauer's home?
Yes, sir.
And what did you find?
This photo shows Mr. Bauer holding a beer.
Is that correct?
Yes. In his right hand.
And he claimed he didn't drink-- is that correct?
There are seven universal emotions:
disgust, anger, fear...
Just the bottom line.
Four jurors
were moved to brief micro-bursts of disgust.
At the crime scene photos?
No. No, the crime photos created universal disgust.
The photos of Mr. Bauer
engendered feelings of directed disgust at Mr. Bauer.
Great. They think we have Colonel Klink as a client.
We still have the robbery evidence.
Kalinda, can you get everything together on the robberies?
No.
Look, I don't want to have to go over your head.
Good, because there is no over my head.
You spent too much on push polling,
and now your ego won't let you back down.
I've brought in the cash that--
Which buys you a place at the table.
Welcome.
The most I have to do is listen to you.
I have listened, and I have found you wanting.
Unless that's Buddha and Jesus on speed dial,
I don't think we have much to talk about.
Jackie, how are you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hi. It's Adam.
You know, it's funny. I'm sitting right here with Eli Gold.
I'm sorry-- do you know Peter's mother?
We became friends during the '04 campaign.
She's the one who phoned me to help.
No. No, no, no, no.
We're playing nice.
You are such a kidder.
You said there were signs of a struggle, Detective?
I did, yes.
And you had been in the neighborhood a week earlier
and found a similar scene, hadn't you?
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
Overruled. You may answer.
Your Honor, may we approach the bench?
You may.
You'll have to excuse us.
We're not being rude intentionally.
Your Honor, the defense is trying to draw a connection
between this murder and three unsolved robberies
in the neighborhood. We would ask for a proffer
Oh, come on.
before they continue with this line of questioning.
There was no sign of forced entry.
There was no sign of forced entry
in the other burglaries, either.
Doors were chosen without peep holes
so the victim would come to the door.
The police cross-referenced the victims' belongings with an inventory
filed with his insurance carrier.
Nothing was missing.
Then let the prosecution argue that,
and let the jury decide, Your Honor.
I'm siding with the prosecution on this.
Unless you can present evidence
to support a theory of robbery,
I'll sustain the objection.
What objection? There was none.
Objection.
Sustained.
Do you have a problem, Mr. Gardner?
Should I have a problem?
Well, that's up to you, isn't it?
Could've gone either way.
No. He's deciding against us.
What do you want to do?
What's going on?
What do you mean?
You.
What's your address?
My address?
Your old address, before you worked here.
2266 Weyburn. Why?
I took this from Blake's car.
And for some reason, it has your old address in it.
What?
He also wrote down a name.
Um, Marcie Raines?
That was my neighbor.
Someone he interviewed over a month ago.
What are you doing?
Excuse me?
What are you doing investigating me?
You talked to my neighbor? Look...
Who the hell told you you could talk to my neighbor?
Look, Alicia...
Don't you dare try to calm me.
It was just a simple background check.
By who?
Who told you to background-check?
I unfortunately can't say.
Don't you ever look into my background again.
Do you have a minute?
Sure.
Oh, that's right.
You wanted to talk when things calmed down.
During the death row appeal,
you said you wanted to talk about something.
Oh, no. I mean, yes.
at some point.
But this is something else.
Someone told Blake to do a background check on me.
Some...What?!
He investigated my old neighborhood.
He talked to my old neighbors.
He said it was a background check.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
It's just... No, you don't have to explain.
I'll find out. I didn't ask for it.
Diane didn't ask for it.
And Bond?
I'll find out.
That's not what I wanted to talk about
It...
I know what it is.
You...?
How do you know?
Diane told me.
Are we possibly talking about two different things?
Diane asked you to join her at her new firm.
Yes.
That's what it was.
I wanted to tell you, but she invoked confidentiality.
I get it. Don't worry.
I don't want to go with her.
Good.
I'm glad.
Okay. I'm going now.
Maybe another time, things will slow down.
Yes, I phoned him.
If you don't mind me saying so,
that was a mistake.
Oh, I don't mind you saying so.
The money he brings has strings attached.
You see, Mr. Gold,
I've just been so out of touch with the campaign.
I... I wanted to help, so I phoned an old friend,
someone who always kept me in touch.
I just...
haven't wanted to trouble you, ma'am.
Oh, yes. Well, I'm sure that's it.
Adam doesn't mind troubling me.
Your Honor.
You didn't play tonight.
Nope. Gotta prepare for trial tomorrow.
Look, Judge...
I feel like the other night, you and I got into it and...
It was just a game. That's all.
I've already forgotten about it.
me, too.
Except, in court, it feels like...
you know.
No. I don't know.
Why don't you enlighten me?
You're not going to make this easy for me, are you?
Look, if you're trying to
accuse me of something, counselor,
why don't you just come out and say it?
Okay.
You're mad because I fouled you,
and you're taxing me in court because of it.
You're letting the SA's office
put any damn thing they want into evidence.
Maybe the SA's office would like to know
that you're having ex parte discussions with me,
about the case,behind their back.
Watch it, Will.
No, you watch it. You're the...
You need to recuse yourself.
I'm asking you to recuse yourself.
No.
Then, let me withdraw,
because right now I'm doing a disservice to my client.
No. We have got a jury.
I am not giving anyone grounds for mistrial.
You took the case. You try it.
It's called defense.
You should learn to play some.
That's the one to keep your eye on.
Right there in the center.
He's the leader.
Now, he's not the most handsome.
He's not the richest.
He's not the... he's not the most knowledgeable.
But he's the pack leader.
You see, people are like dogs.
The way to read them is like dogs.
It's a pack mentality.
How much do you make in a year?
I don't know. Varies.
But you work.
People actually hire you.
Yes. I have an 80% prediction rate.
Yeah. I looked into your past cases.
You're very selective.
You seem to choose cases that are easy to predict.
People don't complain.
People want to believe in magic.
There. There they go.
The pack disperses.
It readjusts. It follows.
Some stay behind.
That's not magic, ma'am.
People are not unique.
They are as predictable as the tides;
as trainable as pets.
Here's what I think we should do.
Judge Weldon is biased.
I think we can get his bias to work for us.
I'm going to provoke him by asking for a recusal.
And I'm afraid I need you to bear the brunt of his anger.
The jury will react more if they see him
being biased against you.
You're going for jury nullification?
Yes, or a strong appeal.
We can't undo his bias, but we can push it.
Okay. Whatever you need.
What's going on?
What's going on with Blake?
You mean my supervisor?
What are you talking about?
Blake has been made my supervisor.
No, he hasn't.
Wait.
Alicia says he's been doing background checks
on the associates.
Yeah. Partners, too.
But I'm sure it's all innocent.
Anyway, I just wanted to wish you good luck.
Wait. Kalinda, stop.
What can I do?
I need you here, working.
$50,000 a year increase.
That's...
too much.
You just paid 120 grand for a medicine man,
so don't talk to me about too much.
His name is Adam Boras.
Part of Peter's 2004 campaign.
He jokes a lot with Peter.
Talks fondly about old times.
No.
What?
This only works when you
don't try to manipulate me, Mr. Gold.
You want to get rid of someone, get rid of someone.
Mrs. Florrick, I wanted to show you something.
Excuse me.
This is from one of my friends.
You see the label on the bottle?
It's a non-alcoholic beer.
That's great. I'll tell Will.
Thank you. I'm just nervous.
As you can imagine.
Go ahead, say it.
No. No, I wasn't going to say anything.
Nazis need to be defended, too.
Feel better getting that out?
Jawohl.
You're right-- this Boras thing is my problem.
It's just that I found out he was phoned by Jackie.
That sounds about right.
I need to talk to Peter
about Jackie's influence in the campaign.
Any thoughts on that?
No.
Thanks, anyway.
Eli...
There's only one thing Jackie loves in life.
She won't listen to me, and she won't listen to you.
She'll only listen to Peter.
That's how you handle Jackie.
You've got a motion, counselor, before I call the jury?
Yes, I do.
We ask you, with all due deference,
to recuse yourself.
The motion is denied.
Your Honor, you have been using a private grudge
to rule from bias.
You've got a lot of nerve.
You've left me no other option.
Please address me as "Your Honor."
Your Honor,
I fouled you in basketball.
You can sit down right now, counselor.
Your bias is clear to all.
I have never held a lawyer in contempt before, Mr. Gardner,
but I will break that streak
if you don't sit the hell down-- now.
Call the jury.
And that's when I saw Mr. Bauer and his son--
there-- arguing.
And did you hear what they were arguing over?
Yes. I'm not a snoop.
It's just, as the building manager,
I hear a lot of things.
Mr. Bauer was a recovering alcoholic.
He expressed his disappointment
that his son was still drinking.
Then he threatened to write him out of his will.
Thank you, Mr. Kuney.
No further questions.
So, just a few questions, sir.
You've been a manager at the apartments
for how long, Mr. Kuney?
Oh, my goodness.
I guess it's been... six years.
Where has the time gone?
And you recently put new locks
on your apartment door, didn't you?
Objection. Relevance.
Your Honor, it is relevant because
it's about the recent burglaries at the apartment.
Counselor, I've already ruled on that.
I'm sorry, Your Honor. No harm, no foul.
Excuse me?
I said, "No harm, no foul."
It's a basketball colloquialism.
Yes, I know what it is.
Do you have a problem?
No, I don't, Your Honor.
My apologies.
May I proceed?
If you have something to say, make a motion.
Don't sneak it into the record.
Of course, I wanted to work with Ike,
but he's got his minions.
We're having the status meeting in here today, Peter.
Oh, okay. Hey, listen. Adam has a great idea
of how we can get some revenue...
Hello.
Mother?
Mother.
What's going on?
Jackie just wanted to come to the status meetings
to keep up on the campaign.
And you said yes?
I didn't say anything.
I just told her when we were having the meetings.
All right, well, tell her she can't.
She doesn't belong here.
No.
I'd love to, Peter... she won't listen to me.
Okay. You'll find the polling results on page five.
Oh, is the type too small for you, Mrs. Florrick?
No. No, this is perfect. Thank you.
Everybody, please welcome Jackie.
She'll be joining us, when she can, at our status meetings.
Come on. Please, ignore me. Please.
There's been a shift.
There was a micro-burst of sympathy for Mrs. Florrick.
But here's the interesting thing.
That sympathy has turned into sympathy for your client.
Good job.
I thought he was going to jump down your throat.
It was your idea.
Okay, so we keep up the pressure.
One thing I'd like to point out--
the pack leader on the jury, juror number three,
the, uh, psychiatrist--
still showing micro-bursts of contempt toward Mr. Bauer.
So we got a biased judge and a biased jury.
So we need to have someone for them to be biased against.
Kalinda, any other suspects?
Actually, I need to ask my supervisor.
I need to talk to you a minute.
I have to catch a plane.
Some last minute details on the super PAC.
We'll talk later?
No. Now.
Why is Blake investigating us?
"Us"?
My lawyers.
My equity partners.
Because I needed to know who I was joining.
No. Blake was investigating even after you joined.
What's going on, partner?
What's going on is information retrieval.
That's all.
I need information--
some of it relevant, some of it not--
and I only know if something is relevant if...
Stop slinging the New Age speak.
I will ask him to stop investigating.
Good.
And Kalinda is to be given a salary bump above Blake's.
He is not her supervisor.
No.
Then we got a problem, because this is the deal.
Either we bump Kalinda's salary above Blake's,
or the waters won't be calmed.
This is feeling a bit like Groundhog Day.
You going to apologize again?
We've been played.
We had the superior numbers.
We had the votes.
And Bond played us against each other.
You thought I was plotting against you; I wasn't.
That's why you're leaving.
We had this conversation already.
We agreed I wasn't leaving.
Yes, but we were both lying.
I'm listening.
I don't like being played.
So I suggest we do the same to Bond.
How?
In two months time,
he's bringing in a super PAC as a client--
$100 million.
At that point, Bond intends to vote you out.
Then he'll have the superior numbers,
and he'll isolate me.
I say we convince him I'm still on board for that plan,
and in the meantime...
We move against him.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's not bicker anymore.
The problem is, there's nobody else.
There's no other way to get the robbery in.
And there's no suspects.
There's no wife, no descendents.
No one else cut out of the will.
Well, maybe he did it.
When did you stop being helpful?
$50,000 a year bump.
And as a thank-you for your years of continued service,
membership at the St. Andrews Country Club.
Just what I wanted.
You'll fit right in.
I've got your back, Kalinda.
Just make sure you got mine.
I always have...
and I always will.
Tell Alicia to target the manager.
The manager? Kuney? Why?
His religion.
Like you said,
we need to give the jury someone else to be biased against.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, you startled me.
Eli said you were out.
What are you doing here?
I want to talk to you.
Really? Why?
Mom, you know I love you.
You're a good son.
But I need you to stop coming to the status meetings.
Oh?
I need to do this on my own.
Oh, of course. I...
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, please don't apologize.
I just want you to understand that... I...
I need to do this on my own.
Is it still all right if I phone for updates?
Only if it's all right with Eli.
Of course.
Good.
Thank you.
I'm tempted,
but I need assurances about the partner track.
I don't want to be summarily fired again.
I, um...
Things have changed, Cary.
What... what's changed? My agreeing to join you?
No, it's just, um... we're a bit more in flux.
Oh, yes.
Flux-- that's one of those great words
that covers a whole boatload of sins.
Come back to us.
Cary, come back to us.
We made a mistake.
We need you.
At Lockhart/Gardner?
Yes.
I don't think so.
I'm having too much fun where I am.
You sure?
What's Alicia's salary?
I don't know exactly,
but I'm sure you can imagine.
Double it, and put me in above her,
and then I'll come back.
You've grown up.
Oh, yeah, I'm a big boy.
It's good to talk to you.
Good morning.
I hope everybody had a good evening.
Counselor, are you, ready for cross?
Yes, Your Honor.
All laced up and ready to go.
Mr. Kuney, you talked
about discussing many things with the victim.
What were they?
What did I discuss?
I don't know.
What do managers discuss with their tenants?
I don't know.
Your religion?
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm just trying to establish
Mr. Kuney's familiarity with the victim.
I'll allow it.
Did you argue
about your religion with Mr. Bauer?
Well, I wouldn't say argue.
We had, spirited discussions.
About your Scientology?
Yes. He thought I was proselytizing.
I thought I was just discussing
the closed-mindedness
of some countries like Germany and France
who refuse to recognize Scientology as a religion.
And during these spirited discussions,
did you discuss Scientology's
ambivalence toward psychology?
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
When the two of you argued--
excuse me-- discussed--
these issues, did you do it--
according to your neighbors-- with raised voices?
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
You have keys to Mr. Bauer's apartment,
don't you, Mr. Kuney?
Yes.
And you are the only one who claimed to see a fight
between our client and his father.
Objection.
Sustained. That's enough, counselor.
No further questions, Your Honor.
How you doing?
All right, hold on, Tom.
Was-was there something that you needed?
Hey!
What...?
Are you nuts?!
That's mine!
Get out.
You are making one big mistake.
Will you escort Mr. Boras out?
Don't forget your coat.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Adam?
Oh, that's awful.
Oh, you better do it if that's what... if that's what Eli wants.
The third quarter has improved.
Although I think there still needs to be
some belt-tightening.
We still have some overcharges in litigation.
Hello, Diane.
Derrick.
It's good to have you back.
It's good to be back.
Anyway, we were discussing the third quarter results.
They're not as dire as anticipated, but,
we still have some overcharges in litigation.
I think this will be the focus of what
we're trying to get accomplished next year.
You seem happy.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Made peace with yourself?
Jury's in.
You're kidding. They just went out.
Yeah, 20 minutes.
Should be interesting.
It's not guilty.
Are you sure?
Micro-bursts of calm for Mr. Bauer.
Good job.
Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
On the charge of first degree murder,
we find the defendant guilty.
You said...
Don't say a thing.
We'll appeal.
Would the, defense
like to poll the jury?
Yes, we would, Your Honor.
Sir?
Excuse me.
I was with the defense.
Yes, I recognize you.
You don't have to answer any of my questions,
but it helps us learn for the future.
No, I'll answer your questions.
It was just such a quick verdict.
Yes, there were, uh, no disagreements.
I see.
And what decided it for you?
"What" Did?
Yes. I mean, obviously,
you didn't take the manager's testimony seriously.
And the judge-- did you believe he was biased?
Oh, sure.
You did. But that didn't enter into your decision?
No.
Why not?
I don't know.
It didn't seem to matter.
Then what did matter?
He did it.
I hope that helps.
