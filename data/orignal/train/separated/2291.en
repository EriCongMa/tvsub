第十三集
You're going to Hell?
The Underworld. I'm getting him back.
My time in the Underworld is done.
Yours can be, too. Just do what I say.
Tell me your father's okay.
He's in a better place now.
That means everyone here...
Can be saved.
Is this a bloody trick?!
Stop.
That's exactly what it is --
a trick.
Don't move.
He wants you to think you can escape, but...
you can't.
No one can.
Aye.
We'll see about that.
Don't!
He'll hunt you down.
Hades has already done his worst to me.
I don't mean Hades.
Who, then?
No.
Just don't.
Look, this isn't my first cell.
I don't just sit around and rot.
Now, somebody's come down here to save me,
and I need to make her job easier.
How do you know she's here?
She got me a message.
How do you know that wasn't one of Hades' tricks?
Because I know!
When you love someone, you know.
Now, what's keeping us in here?
Something you don't want to face.
Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Time to go.
Are you mad?
Perhaps.
But I'm the best chance you have.
Here.
You ready?
All right, go. Go!
I told you we'll never make it.
We won't... but you will.
I'll draw the hell beasts away. You run.
And once you're free, find Emma Swan.
I'm Captain Killian Jones -- Captain Hook.
Tell her to find me.
Okay.
Go!
Mary Margaret. What are -- What are you doing?
We've got a lot of ground to cover.
David, these graves.
They're all from my father's kingdom.
They were my subjects. I was supposed to protect them.
And now how am I supposed to protect our daughter
in the Underworld?
Because you're not doing this alone.
Mary Margaret, we will find a way to protect Emma.
We always do.
Now, come on.
She's looking for Hook in the woods just south of here.
She's good...
but nobody's better at tracking than Bandit Snow.
Let's go help her.
What is it?
Mary Margaret? What's wrong?
Princess Snow, you must stop him.
The bandit and his men --
They're terrorizing our villages and roads.
But my father -- he's on a diplomatic mission.
I'll send word to him.
By the time it reaches him, we will all be dead.
We need help now.
Fear not.
My stepdaughter will take care of all of you.
I will?
What do we do?
People are dying.
Princess Snow?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
No.
Help!
Anyone?!
Grab on. I'll pull you up.
Thank you.
You gotta watch out for hunter traps.
I'm Snow White.
Yes.
You certainly are.
I'm Hercules.
But you can call me Herc.
You...knew Hercules?
We were friends when we were kids.
Define "friends."
Do I detect a hint of jealousy?
Oh, it's not every day your wife
tells you that she was friends with a god.
A demi-god...
who also happens to be dead.
Hey, I'm sorry. I was just giving you a hard time.
No, I know. I know.
David...
...if he's down here, he has unfinished business.
We have to help him find a way to move on.
At the expense of searching for Hook?
No, David, think about it.
He's...Hercules.
He can help us.
We save him.
He can save us.
Mom, we already covered this trail.
It was cold.
Then we cover it again,
and we keep going until we find a trail that's hot.
You think there'd be more of those in the Underworld.
There's no sign of Hook in the North Woods.
Well, we have to keep going.
Maybe out by the Troll Bridge.
Wait.
What?
There may be a way to make our search quicker.
How?
In Storybrooke, I have schematics --
maps -- of the whole town.
Every last inch of it.
So you think the equivalent maps of this town are here?
Everything else in Bizarro Storybrooke
has an analog so far.
I'm on it. You keep working here.
I'll go get you your intel.
Wait.
Take Henry.
It might be dangerous.
My mother's gone now. The office should be empty.
And no one knows it better than Henry.
He'll be fine. You'll be there to protect him.
All right, come on. Let's go.
All right, let's get back to it.
Emma?
Regina, I found something!
Blood.
There's a trail of it.
It's not dry yet. It's fresh.
Killian.
Killian?!
Killian?!
Not Killian, but I know him.
Who are you? Where's Killian?
We have to get out of here.
What the hell is that?
It's coming. Hide me. We have to go -- now!
Your parents' apartment? Really?
It's the first place I thought of.
Here. Lie down.
What if whoever -- or whatever -- lives here,
you know, comes home?
I don't think we have to worry about that.
So this place is just waiting for your parents to die
so they can move in?
Creepy, but that seems to be the case.
I think we're safe here.
It's officially a cold day in hell
when I move in with the Charmings.
Are you okay?
I will be.
And Hook?
I...
I don't know.
Where is he?
In an underground prison.
I escaped through tunnels.
They let out in a
cave somewhere in the woods, and...
next thing I knew, you found me.
Where is the cave? Could you find it again?
Yes.
But it's being guarded by something...
terrible.
What's guarding the cave?
It...
it has three heads.
Its -- Its teeth
can crush your bones with a single bite.
And those eyes...
...they burn right through your soul
as it finishes you off.
Nothing can defeat this monster.
That's not true.
I know exactly what this beast is...
...and how we can defeat it.
So, are you really a god?
Demi-god.
My mother was mortal.
I've never met a demi-anything before.
I can't join my father on Mount Olympus
until I complete my Twelve Labors.
And then you'll be immortal?
That's the idea.
But as much as I like discussing my family tree,
you can't avoid yours forever.
I can't face anyone
until I figure out what to do about the bandits.
I've got your answer.
You're gonna fight them.
Me?
I'm not a hero.
You will be after I train you.
No.
Snow...
you can't let the fear of failing
stop you from trying.
This medal --
it was for the first Labor I ever completed --
defeating the Nemean Lion.
I was scared.
But I didn't back down.
I fought the lion, and I won.
And I wouldn't have this medal
if I'd been too afraid to try.
Easy for you to say.
Snow...
I'm going to teach you how to stand up to those bandits
so they never show their faces in your kingdom again.
Why are you doing this for me?
Because you're gonna make a great queen one day.
I'm a good judge of character.
And also, uh...
...it gives me an excuse to
spend as much time as I can with you
before I complete my final Labor.
I only have a few fleeting moments down here.
And I want to enjoy them.
So, what exactly is your last Labor?
It's the most difficult one of them all...
...defeating the three-headed hellhound -- Cerberus.
You really think she'll know where he is?
Of course.
We need someone who sees everyone.
Hey, child-muncher.
We're looking for someone.
Why should I help you, Regina?
You burned me alive.
It was Hansel and Gretel.
At your behest, and with your fireball.
Fine. Fine.
But you stole my apple.
What do you think happens when you steal from a witch, witch?
Fair enough.
So, who are you looking for?
His name's Hercules.
You know, from the myths.
I know who Hercules is.
He comes in here on his lunch break every day.
And no matter how hard I try to fatten him up,
his muscles are always bulging.
It's a shame.
He'd make a great Sunday roast.
Lunch break from where?
Herc?
You don't recognize me, do you?
Snow?
You're still so young.
When -- How did...?
You mean, uh, how did I die?
That's, uh --
That -- That's not important.
What are you doing down here?
I mean, how did you...?
I'm not dead.
Um, I came down here to help my daughter.
You have a daughter?
And a son.
And a grandson, actually.
You are not a grandmother.
Actually...
it's kind of a convoluted story,
but, um, I am.
It's been quite a life.
Yeah.
Yeah, I wish I could say the same.
I'm so sorry.
What if I told you there might be a way
for you to leave the Underworld once and for all?
I never finished my Labors.
I can't move on until I do.
I know.
And Cerberus is here.
Here?
He's -- He's guarding a prison
where the man my daughter loves is being held. And...
Hercules, you're the only one
strong enough to defeat that beast.
It's your destiny.
Well, that hero died.
Only if you let him.
Don't forget what you taught me.
You can't let fear of failure keep you from trying.
Oh, this is going to be quite an exciting day.
It will be... when I kill you.
Why does everyone say that?
You can't kill me. I'm Hades.
This -- This is death.
Well, then, I'll find whatever's worse
and do it to you.
Oh, I see you've --
you met my pet.
You're about to realize his master
is not nearly as friendly.
Wait.
Protection spell.
Looks like Grandma Cora left this place locked up.
Not completely.
Okay.
All right. You stay here.
No.
Someone needs to stand guard outside,
and only one of us knows
where to look in my mom's office.
Be very careful.
Hello, darling.
Cruella.
Tell me, how is your mother?
Oh, yes, with you, I need to be more specific.
How is the one that killed me?
This is the tunnel she said she came out of.
Hook's in here somewhere.
All right, wonder boy,
are you sure you can do this?
Regina!
I know you can do this.
We'll find your friend. Don't worry.
Wait for me here.
Where's the rest of it?
That's all we have.
I swear.
Leave my people alone!
Princess Snow, please, help us.
Where's your daddy's army?
I don't need...an army.
Return what you've taken from these people
and leave my kingdom...
or the next arrow lands in your good eye.
I'd like to see you try.
Run back to your palace, little girl.
These are my woods now.
Leave her alone!
Or you're going to have to answer to me.
Your boyfriend won't be around to protect you forever.
We did exactly what you asked.
There's more where this came from.
Are you sure you don't want me to kill her?
I won't turn her into a martyr for these people to worship.
No.
I have to turn them against her.
And these miserable people will finally realize the truth.
I am meant to be their queen.
Herc!
Come on.
What the hell was that?
I called them off.
Who are you?
My uncle.
Hades?
Don't look so surprised.
Who'd you think was in charge of this place -- your mommy?
Well, if this is your realm,
maybe you can answer a few questions.
Like why does this hell-hole look like Storybrooke?
I have my reasons,
and I don't have to share them with you.
Leave them alone, uncle.
There's that famous courage people love to talk about.
Oh, Hercules,
did you really think you could face Cerberus again?
Again?
You mean he didn't tell you?
Cerberus killed you.
Yeah, I didn't want you to know.
Snow, I couldn't let you down.
Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of, nephew.
After all, losing your life to my little pet
is what finally brought us together as family.
We're not afraid of you.
Snow White.
Or is it Mary Margaret?
My nephew said you were a spitfire,
but trust me,
you should be quite afraid of me
because the next time you interfere with my family,
I will come after yours.
Bring it. We're not gonna rest until we find Hook.
Oh, and that must make you Emma.
Since your pirate likes to send you messages,
I told him I would deliver this one personally.
What did you do to him?
It's not what I've already done you should worry about now.
It's what I'm about to do.
So, darling, this is actually quite fortuitous.
What do you want?
Why, you, of course.
I need your help.
You see, Hades, the being that runs this place,
has set up the most awful conundrum.
For those of us in this ghastly Underworld,
we have two choices --
leaving for a better place or a worse one.
I think I know where you'll end up.
Charming.
Just like your family.
And also probably quite correct,
which is why I need a third choice --
to go back to the real world.
Oh, how I miss it.
The music, the gin, the glamour...
the gin.
You're already dead. No one can change that.
Actually, one person can -- the Author.
Oh, yes, that's you now.
No.
The Apprentice told me it's impossible.
Because he didn't want you to.
But, Henry, you can.
The Author's power is far greater
than that bearded old man wanted you to believe.
I destroyed the quill.
Oh, yes, yes, I know what you did.
We hear it all down here.
But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you?
The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you,
but it is not a simple pen.
It is a magical energy.
It is a living, breathing entity.
It's alive?
Oh, yes.
And when you broke it, Henry,
you sent it right down here to the Underworld,
its purpose unfulfilled.
It epitomized unfinished business.
And now you are going to find it down here with my help.
And you're going to send me right back to our world.
Why would I ever help you?
Because, Henry, if I come back to life, guess what happens?
The woman who killed me -- your mother --
is no longer a murderer.
You see?
You see, by helping me, Henry,
you can restore Mommie dearest to the pure soul she once was.
You can save her.
What are you doing?
We have to find Hook.
I can't help you.
We can't have you quitting.
I'm not quitting. I'm being practical.
Since when are you practical?
This is all my fault.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
Hercules was destined to kill Cerberus.
I thought it would help us get to Hook.
But now--
Now is not the time to give up.
Need I remind you I dedicated years to knocking you down?
But nothing could stop you.
You took my kingdom.
'Cause your curse, I lost my daughter for 28 years.
And then you found her.
You defeated me in a way no one thought was possible.
You made me your friend by never giving up on me.
So what's the difference this time?
And how am I supposed to help anyone stand up to Hades
when all I have is... speeches about hope?
You're right.
Mary Margaret can't help.
In fact, we don't need her anymore.
We need Snow White.
What are you doing?
I'm done, Herc.
I tried to be a leader,
but I am not cut out to be one.
Regina will make a better queen than I could ever hope to be.
So you're just going to abandon your kingdom?
I don't want to be Snow White anymore.
That's a shame because I was really starting to like her.
I was crazy to think that
I could stand up to those bandits.
No one wins every battle, Snow,
especially their first.
You did.
Can you keep a secret?
My first labor nearly killed me.
It's the truth.
The Nemean Lion.
Do you know why no one could kill it?
'Cause his fur was impenetrable, like steel.
With every blow I struck, all I did was blunt my sword.
So how did you defeat it?
When I had exhausted myself
and I thought that the beast was going to kill me,
I accidentally dropped my torch.
I set the brush surrounding us on fire.
The flames singed the lion's fur from his body.
He wasn't invincible anymore.
And I slayed him.
Don't you see?
If I hadn't failed,
I never would have figured out how to succeed.
Okay.
So, how do I stop these bandits?
Pick it up.
It's pointless, Snow.
I can't defeat Cerberus.
We're just going to antagonize my uncle.
Well, that's a chance we're going to have to take.
Herc, how did Cerberus kill you?
Why does it matter?
Because -- Because that is the only way
we're gonna figure out how to defeat him next time.
He has three heads, Snow.
Okay, when I would face one,
no matter how valiantly I fought,
the other two would attack.
I never should have fought that beast alone.
Well, that's it.
That's why you're going to win this time.
You're not going to fight him alone.
You want to face Cerberus with me?
Herc, I became that hero you always believed I could be.
And we are going to fight that three-headed beast,
and we are going to win.
Regina?
What is it?
Did Mary Margaret talk Muscles into giving it another go?
I don't think so.
Run! Just go!
Let me guess -- the Cerberus?
What do we have here?
Give it back!
Princess Snow.
Give that woman her necklace.
Then leave here and never come back.
I seem to remember
you delivering a similar warning yesterday.
Give that woman her necklace.
Careful.
What the...?
Lower your weapons.
Or do I need to disarm all of you?
You think you're tough, Princess?
This isn't over.
Yeah, it is.
I did it!
I knew you could do it.
Thanks to you.
I guess you don't need me to train you anymore.
Does this mean you're going to leave to defeat Cerberus?
Do you want to come?
I'd love to.
But, Herc...
I think my people need me more right now.
You're gonna make an amazing queen.
And Olympus will be lucky to have a hero like you.
Are you okay? What happened?
Cerberus. He found us.
Where's the prisoner?
She ran when the hellhound attacked.
We gave her a head start,
but there was only so long we could hold it off.
We should split up.
We have to find her before that monster does.
Go.
Come on.
You shouldn't be here.
We're here to help.
He found us.
What now?
We get her in there.
Come on.
Any bright ideas?
We hit all three heads at once.
How are we gonna do that?
With her help.
Give her your dagger.
No, no, I can't do that.
Yes, you can.
You can.
You have to try.
Ready?
Now!
I guess I'm not used to all that excitement.
I'm Hercules.
Megara.
But my friends call me Meg.
Thanks for the assist, Meg.
I...
I think we've met before.
Please! Please!
Hey, what is it?
It's the monster!
You're --
you're the boy that tried to save me.
"Tried"?
I'm afraid Cerberus got me...
right after he got you.
Run. Run.
No, he'll kill you.
I don't care now. Go.
I'm so sorry, Meg, I...
What for?
You may not have saved me back then,
but you made up for it now.
Thank you.
Looks like Herc found a new friend.
Maybe defeating Cerberus
wasn't Hercules' only piece of unfinished business.
Maybe he needed to save her, too.
You okay?
Yeah.
You didn't know me in the Enchanted Forest, Emma, but...
...I was someone who took risks even when she was afraid.
I was someone who...
I guess, inspired people.
An old enemy reminded me of that.
I just don't want to ever run the risk
of forgetting who I was again.
What are you saying, Mary Margaret?
I'm saying I don't want to be Mary Margaret anymore.
I want to be Snow White again.
Well, it's about time.
I think we can make that happen...
...Snow.
Henry.
Henry, are you all right?
Yeah.
Did you find anything?
Uh, no. Nothing.
Dead end.
Okay.
Do you think you can get to the prison through the tunnels?
Yes, thanks to your map.
If it weren't for Hook,
I'd still be rotting in that cell.
You'll tell him that I did the right thing?
That he was right to trust me?
I will.
Thank you.
Are you sure you don't want us to stay and help?
I think you've been down here long enough.
And if you don't cross before your uncle finds you,
who knows what he'll do?
I was right.
You became an amazing hero.
What is it?
Olympus.
The prisoner you aided in escape --
she moved on from this realm.
Good for her.
Get on with it, then.
Oh, this?
Oh, this? No.
This isn't for you.
It's for your friends.
Yeah.
What in the bloody hell am I supposed to do with this?
Simple accounting, really.
At first, I wanted your friends to leave.
I really had such a smooth-running operation
going here before they arrived,
but now I've decided they've caused too much damage,
so my vindictive side --
did you know I have one?
It wants to punish them.
So, from now on,
for every soul your friends free,
one of them is going to have to stay.
And, Captain...
you get to decide who.
