this doesn &apos;t prove anything .
of course it doesn &apos;t prove anything ,
and yet , show that to a jury ,
and a million dollar suit turns into a $ 20 million one .
and if i get it kicked as prejudicial ?
it &apos;s judge abernathy .
you &apos;re representing a deep @-@ pocketed , big bad internet company
who treated its employees so poorly ,
three of them committed suicide in a month .
this one in his own cubicle .
what side do you think abernathy will be on ?
you &apos;ve changed .
i have .
what happened to that cute little housewife that i used to know ?
when did she grow to be so tall ?
you know , they say ,
you always kill the woman terrorists first .
the male ones-- well , they hesitate .
they fear death .
not the women .
then maybe you should consider settling .
i &apos;ll talk to my client .
good . have you been well ?
i have .
oh , i heard there was another turnover at lockhart / gardner .
yes . it &apos;s a new day .
a new , new day .
sounds like you have one of those things every few months .
do they miss me ?
oh , terribly , but then , every time we end up
on the opposite side of a case from you , it eases the pain .
oh , and your husband-- oh , i hear he &apos;s up by three points .
he &apos;s doing quite well , thank you .
playing the race card .
oh , the suburbs ,
how they love their white politicians .
you are going to become a very valuable commodity very soon .
how &apos;s your daughter , mr. stern ?
every firm in the city is gonna come out of the woodwork
trying to get their hooks into you .
wife of the state &apos;s attorney , a practicing lawyer ,
and not bad to look at , either .
have a number to me by 6 : 00 .
do nothing . say nothing .
we are three points up with six days to go .
the only way wendy scott @-@ carr wins is if we mess up .
if a reporter comes up to you , what does everyone say ?
that &apos;s right . nothing .
hello , petra .
what a glorious day it is today .
how are you ?
eli , you are so counting your chickens .
why , whatever do you mean ?
i &apos;m just sitting here , chatting with my favorite reporter .
so , what do you think of the dcc suit ?
the dcc suit ?
i don &apos;t know . what should i think ?
did you have anything to do with it ?
i am the first one to call you , aren &apos;t i ?
no . what are we talking about here ?
the democratic committee has brought suit against wendy scott @-@ carr ,
charging her with a lack of residency status .
get the dcc now !
so , are you party to this suit ?
are we party ? no .
in fact , we believe that any question
of our opposition &apos;s residency is misguided .
that &apos;s a ... nice quote .
can you get me another one from the candidate ?
what &apos;s your deadline ?
well , online edition in 20 minutes .
i &apos;ll call you back .
what the hell were you thinking ? !
you stupid bastard !
let go !
we &apos;re up by three points !
and we &apos;re helping !
no !
where did you go to school , you idiot ? !
you stupid son of a bitch .
you novice !
wendy &apos;s husband &apos;s not a resident .
they spend more time out of illinois than in it .
you gave her an issue !
you gave her a reprieve !
the court will invalidate her votes .
no , they won &apos;t !
a lower court will .
it &apos;ll look like machine politics .
we finally positioned ourselves as the enemy of the machine ,
and in one fell swoop ,
you make it clear that wendy is the enemy of the machine !
well , what &apos;s done is done .
no , it is not ,
because you &apos;re gonna drop this suit and apologize .
say it came from some underling with an itchy trigger finger .
too late . i already gave a quote .
you know , i don &apos;t have many enemies in life .
i get along with republicans ,
protestants , catholics ,
even a few reporters .
but the one thing i hate
is amateurs .
stern signed off on admitting this video into evidence ?
yes , but i don &apos;t think he thought we &apos;d end up in court .
well , it &apos;s now 6 : 00 , and he &apos;s not calling with a number ,
so i think we &apos;re ending up in court .
it &apos;s probably not a bad thing .
if i were on this jury , i &apos;d want to punish someone for that .
has she seen this ?
no , but she knows i have it .
best way to get it into evidence is through her testimony .
can you prep her ?
you mean show this to her ?
you all right with that ?
yes .
so , who else are we going to use from the rest of the class ?
the fired one with the kids .
emily haas .
yes .
thanks for holding them together .
i &apos;ll be right back .
do you need some help , little girl ?
no , i &apos;m good .
where &apos;d you get these ?
my sister .
do you remember helena ?
she &apos;s staying the weekend .
she said to say hello .
she did not .
well , she said some other things , too .
she doesn &apos;t still hold a grudge , does she ?
no , no . the first decade she did .
she wasn &apos;t used to people breaking up with her .
she usually was the heartbreaker .
does she think it &apos;s weird we &apos;re ... ?
she thinks i &apos;m competing with her .
well , then you &apos;ve won .
we &apos;ve been with each other longer than her .
i got an offer to go to london .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
they want me to go to london for the olympics .
next year ?
no . this year ,
to be their man on the ground in the rev @-@ up .
are you going ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay .
i get it .
good .
what ?
what are we ?
no .
should i go to london ?
it &apos;s a good opportunity .
it &apos;s a promotion .
and you want to go ?
that &apos;s the subject under discussion .
i need some help .
i think i should go .
okay , then i think that &apos;s a smart plan .
when @-@ when would you leave ?
two weeks .
wow . fast .
yup .
okay .
see you .
morning .
you have the aubrey client meeting at 9 : 00 .
and the final contracts on your desk for thompson .
i &apos;ll give you ten more minutes .
then i need you on the phone with new york .
yup .
stern is dead .
okay , who &apos;s doing it ?
just keep me in touch .
when ?
i don &apos;t know .
sometime during the night .
his secretary just found him this morning .
well , that &apos;s the end of an era .
i kind of don &apos;t know what to think .
i mean , he brought us together .
yeah . then he took half our clients ,
and he &apos;s been bludgeoning us with them ever since .
when &apos;s the funeral ?
tomorrow . just the family .
but they &apos;re sitting shiva for the week .
is it horrible of me ?
i don &apos;t know , but i was thinking the same thing .
we can grab our clients back .
yup .
i already made a list .
we can &apos;t call them now , can we ?
well , that might seem ... opportunistic .
what &apos;s the etiquette ?
tomorrow .
i mean , if we don &apos;t , other firms will jump in .
other firms without the same sense of restraint ?
we should call on his wife and daughter .
sitting shiva ?
sure .
you think his firm &apos;s in play ?
could be .
that would be bad .
clients might stay put .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
i mean , how awful .
he was dead the whole night .
everyone thought it was just another one of his all @-@ nighters .
the life of a lawyer .
i don &apos;t want to die like that .
then don &apos;t .
pamela harriman .
now that was a death .
doing laps in the paris ritz pool .
doesn &apos;t matter , does it ?
i mean , we all end up in the same place .
all that &apos;s left is ... our wikipedia entry .
well , you &apos;re a bundle of joy .
stay healthy .
okay , not too opportunistic .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
solomon harwell . lsg .
we had 11 million of their business last year .
yes .
and his son just made it into harvard .
solomon , how are you ?
counselor , how are you ?
we &apos;re a stronger firm these days .
the economy knocked out some of our competitors ,
but we survived .
oh , i know . i always liked you guys .
but i &apos;m waiting to see who &apos;s buying stern &apos;s firm first .
who &apos;s buying ? what do you mean ?
stern was selling his firm .
he was retiring .
i didn &apos;t know that .
who was he selling it to ?
mrs. florrick ?
funny to see you here .
yes , funny .
you knew mr. stern ?
i did .
not for that long . just the last four months .
he was helping me become adjusted to chicago .
it &apos;s a sad day .
yes . very sad .
but i didn &apos;t realize ,
mr. canning , that you were still here .
i thought you went back to new york .
oh , no , no , no .
i like it here .
in fact , i think we &apos;ll be seeing each other in court again soon .
we will ? why ?
stern &apos;s last case .
uh , you &apos;re taking over ?
well ... i bought his firm .
every case , every client .
looks like we &apos;ll be facing off quite a bit now .
wendy scott @-@ carr is an illinois resident .
this is her summer home in forest lake ,
not in michigan as the democratic committee suggests .
and why isn &apos;t wendy &apos;s team showing me that ?
&apos;cause they &apos;re three points down , and they want the dcc
to continue to shoot themselves in the foot .
they actually seem to be shooting you in the foot .
all the more reason to print it .
i got a background quote that florrick has bimbo issues .
had bimbo issues .
no , i @-@ i think i got the tense right .
you &apos;re not gonna print it .
am i not ?
if it &apos;s untrue , you &apos;re not .
and we know this how ?
because peter is a reformed man .
this is pretty convincing stuff .
he , uh ... he slept with a coworker ,
and is actively trying to hide it from his wife .
and i hear the state &apos;s attorney has an investigator
named andrew wiley snooping around .
there are some very real human beings
in this little drama .
yes , and i know that is always your first concern .
get me a quote from the wife .
no .
then i &apos;ll run what i have .
you &apos;ll run a rumor .
half our newspaper is a rumor .
how do you think news becomes news ?
get mrs. florrick on the phone with me .
maybe i &apos;ll run something else .
give me 48 hours .
24 .
thank you . please .
i didn &apos;t know
jonas stern outside of our few shared moments here ,
but it &apos;s always worth a moment
to reflect on how ... fleeting life is .
how we really only ...
hold so much ... sand in our hands .
tant &apos;è amara che poco
è pi u morte , as they say .
anyway ,
i hear that negotiations have broken down ,
and we &apos;re ready to go .
yes ? then let &apos;s call the jury .
and when would you say things changed , mr. yellins ?
well , about six months ago .
after kim palmieri took over as ceo .
kim palmieri , the defendant ?
yes . it started with little things .
they closed the employee break room ,
they cut our sick days .
they laid people off so the rest of us were forced
to come in on the weekends and take up the slack .
the air conditioning was off , so the place was an oven .
finally , i came in to my office one day ,
and my desk was gone .
where did it go ?
they &apos;d moved it to the copy room .
my supervisor , kevin ,
made me gather my things into a box
and walk over to the copy room with everybody staring at me ,
and that was the most humiliating ...
uh , so after that , i couldn &apos;t go back there .
i quit .
no further questions .
so ... they , uh ... they closed the break room ?
yes .
i see . i &apos;m ... sorry .
and the air conditioner being turned off-- that was tough .
well , it was the idea of @-@ of working on the weekends .
i understand .
and this moved desk-- how far was that ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . the end of the building .
and everybody &apos;s eyes were on you ?
the whole firm &apos;s .
that must have been humiliating , with everyone ...
watching you .
how @-@ how far was it , do you think , 50 feet ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
well , let &apos;s ...
let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s try it .
was it this far , your humiliating walk ?
the one with everyone staring at you ?
uh , no , it was further .
okay , was it ... was it a straight line ,
or was @-@ was something in your way , or ... ?
uh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re getting the point .
the point is that it was painful and humiliating .
i mean , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s why you &apos;re suing .
and i &apos;m just trying to ascertain the extent of your humiliation .
was it this far , your @-@ your walk with everybody
watching you ?
we need to hit the videotaped hanging harder .
kalinda , what do you have ?
their financials .
the company claims
they cut employee perks because of the economy ,
but i found this buried under a miscellaneous line item .
two point seven million
paid to a company called haver associates .
a human resources consultant .
they tell you how to fire people .
以供另一方查阅的审讯前的程序
this should have been turned over in discovery .
yup . looks like they were trying to hide it .
good . stay on it .
and so your husband took his own life ?
yes .
he called me
and asked me to hug our daughters ,
to read them goodnight moon .
he loved reading them that .
and then he took an extension cord ,
and stood on his desk and hung himself .
and you &apos;ve seen the surveillance video of your husband &apos;s suic ... ?
objection !
your honor , mr. canning ...
this is completely absurd , your honor .
it &apos;s decided .
no , it &apos;s not .
this was already settled .
with another lawyer .
your honor ?
over here .
i find lawyers less aggressive when seated . please .
everybody , please take a seat .
and no leaning forward .
everybody take a deep breath .
good . mr. canning , let &apos;s start with you .
it &apos;s prejudicial , your honor .
it &apos;s a surveillance video of mr. joyce committing suicide by hanging himself .
it serves no probative value , other than to inflame the jury .
uh , mr. gardner , mrs. florrick .
it goes to pain and suffering .
mrs. joyce not only had to suffer her husband &apos;s suicide ,
she had to see the surveillance video .
because you showed it to her .
uh @-@ uh @-@ uh . mr. canning , you &apos;ll have your chance .
mr. canning &apos;s predecessor counsel ,
mr. stern , already signed off on our evidence list .
he had no objection to this video .
that &apos;s true , mr. canning .
why are we reopening this particular can of worms ?
no , no . don &apos;t lean forward .
just ... i just have to get something from my case , your honor . oh .
in going over our records with our medical carrier ,
i discovered several prescriptions for donepezil
made out to mr. stern .
it &apos;s a drug commonly used for
treatment of alzheimer &apos;s and dementia .
it &apos;s a scourge of the elderly , as you know .
yes . my nana suffered from it .
she hardly knew me at the end .
oh , that &apos;s terrible . it was the same with my mom
when i visited her at the care center .
is there some reason for ... ?
i believe lockhart / gardner was aware of
mr. stern &apos;s condition , and took advantage of a disabled man
who didn &apos;t know what he was signing .
this is ridiculous .
i had no idea whatsoever , your honor .
mrs. florrick ?
mrs. florrick ?
were you aware of mr. stern &apos;s diminished condition ?
your honor , i ...
i regret i can &apos;t answer that question ,
due to the bond of attorney @-@ client privilege .
ah . well , then , you leave me no choice
but to read between the lines here .
uh , mr. stern &apos;s evidentiary agreement no longer holds sway ,
and mr. canning &apos;s objection to the videotape is sustained .
so what , we &apos;re keeping secrets here ?
no , we &apos;re keeping privilege .
okay , so hypothetically then .
you &apos;re an associate ,
and a partner at your firm asks you to represent him .
yes .
and during the course of that representation ,
you learn certain things about that partner ,
and he instructs you not to inform anyone .
including the other partners , yes .
hypothetically in that situation ,
i would be bound by that , even after his death .
great . stern &apos;s dead , and he &apos;s still screwing us .
here comes the monster !
oh , i &apos;m gonna get you .
hey , thanks for dropping by .
no problem , wiley .
what are you investigating now ?
uh , childs has me on a . huh .
where did i put that ?
what &apos;s your wife working on ?
uh , a spaceship .
for richard branson . virgin galactic .
she &apos;s designing one of his rockets .
okay , why did she marry you anyway ?
because of my sense of humor .
hey , i want clothes on , teeth brushed in five minutes !
so childs has me on this last interview blake gave .
what do you mean ?
i mean , the investigation into kalinda sharma .
he gave one last interview about her .
to who ?
matan .
i was supposed to collate all these interview notes of this .
and this is what matan sent to me .
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s supposed to be five pages .
two are missing .
okay . happens all the time .
he tell you anything about the missing pages ?
did matan ? no . why ?
he said he did .
trying to catch me in a lie , good buddy ?
are you still protecting your friend kalinda , good buddy ?
it was my understanding the investigation was over .
the investigation &apos;s never over .
mr. childs , it &apos;s andrew wiley .
yeah , hold on . let me put you on speaker .
okay , uh , mr. childs , you &apos;re on .
i &apos;m here with cary .
look , cary , the department is divided ,
so i need you two to find out
what &apos;s going on with these missing notes .
i think matan is playing politics here ,
trying to pad his resume for whoever takes over .
you want us to interview matan ?
no , he &apos;ll say it &apos;s just a mistake .
i want you to find out what &apos;s in those missing notes .
cary ?
uh , yeah ?
why did matan say he talked to you about these missing pages ?
i have no idea .
okay , find me these two pages so we can wrap this up .
hello .
oh , hi .
did you see will ?
no .
oh ... do you want to ?
no , i ... my sister is staying with me .
i just needed to get out of the house .
my sister used to date will .
yes , i know .
she was talking about will breaking up with her ,
and the reason he broke up with her ,
and ... the @-@ the person
he broke up with her for , it &apos;s you , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
oh !
i &apos;m married .
i &apos;ve moved on ; will has moved on .
we were kids .
we &apos;re not kids anymore .
i don &apos;t know ; will still is .
no .
he isn &apos;t .
he thinks he is .
sorry , i &apos;m late .
i got it from haver associates .
the h.r. consultants .
yep .
&quot; in addition to restructuring 20 % of human resources ... &quot;
meaning firing two out of every ten employees .
... they said that palmieri could recognize &quot; significant savings
&quot; if a meaningful percentage of labor
could be induced to resign ,
rather than being terminated . &quot;
meaning make people so miserable they &apos;ll quit ,
and you &apos;ll save a bundle in severance .
they did it intentionally .
that &apos;s the smoking gun .
they deliberately created a hostile work environment
to get people to quit .
well , with this , we can get the hanging video back in .
we can show that their conduct
was designed to make him depressed .
we can do more than that .
it &apos;s an intentional tort .
that opens &apos; em up to punitive damages .
they made three people kill themselves .
so ... we &apos;ll make them pay for it .
is there anybody here
who thinks marty is good at his job ?
huh ? anybody ?
aw , come on , there must be somebody .
madelyn ?
that &apos;s quite a performance , ms. palmieri .
i admit , i can be passionate .
but as ceo , i &apos;m responsible .
do you recognize this document ?
uh , yes , it &apos;s part of a consulting report we commissioned .
can you read ...
that paragraph for us , ms. palmieri ?
&quot; in addition to restructuring 20 % of human resources ,
&quot; significant savings could be realized
&quot; if a meaniful percentr could be induced to resign ,
rather than being terminated . &quot;
if you got people to quit instead of firing them ,
you &apos;d save money .
no severance package , no benefits-- is that it ?
it was one strategy that was suggested by the outside consultancy
we didn &apos;t follow it .
did you know that six hours after your ... motivational meeting ,
martin joyce committed suicide ?
i did know that .
no further questions .
ms. palmieri ,
your management style , it &apos;s a bit , uh ...
&quot; confrontational , &quot; i think is what you said .
it can be , yes .
and in your experience , is that is that unusual ?
no .
times are tough .
employers face severe financial restrictions .
so there &apos;s reason for your being confrontational ?
yes . if we don &apos;t squeeze every drop
of productivity from our employees ,
we &apos;ll be forced to ship their jobs overseas ,
where labor costs are considerably cheaper .
so you were trying to keep jobs in america .
yes , i was .
can i help you ?
you &apos;re being investigated .
by ?
andrew wiley .
he noticed two pages of notes
were missing from your interview with blake .
childs thinks you &apos;re hiding something criminal ,
something blake told you about kalinda .
it &apos;s not criminal .
it &apos;s personal .
okay .
personal to @-@ to who , to kalinda ?
since when do you care about protecting kalinda ?
i don &apos;t . i care about protecting this office .
what does kalinda have to do with this office ?
not the current inhabitant of this office .
kalinda and peter florrick ?
it &apos;s got nothing to do with childs .
but if he gets ahold of it , it &apos;s scorched earth .
they had an affair ?
a one @-@ nighter .
back when kalinda worked here .
blake had details , verifiable ones .
florrick will do anything to cover it up .
he promised to keep me in this job .
i need to tell wiley it &apos;s not criminal ,
but the problem is , is that he may go to childs with it anyway .
so what do you suggest we do ?
mrs. florrick ? excuse me . mrs. florrick ?
this is kind of awkward--
my , uh , my driver went home sick ,
and i was wondering if i could trouble ...
see , this is what i love about chicago .
it &apos;s a real community .
people helping each other out .
your driver isn &apos;t really sick , is he , mr. canning ?
mrs. florrick , there &apos;s got to be a word for people
who are always finding hidden motives in things .
right ?
i want you to come and work for me .
my new law firm .
fast @-@ track to full partnership ,
percentage of plaintiffs &apos; contingency fees .
why would you do that ?
because you beat me in court last time .
no . will and diane beat you .
well , you &apos;re cheaper .
probably doesn &apos;t hurt that my husband &apos;s going to be stats attorney .
no , you &apos;re right , that doesn &apos;t hurt .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re a good fit , mr. canning .
but thank you .
do you know the sign of an immature person ?
when they can &apos;t distinguish
between morality at home and morality at work .
oh , is that ... is that me , now ?
i do what i need to do at work to win .
i go home , i cuddle with my wife ,
i cuddle with my kids ,
and i tell them pretty storiesabout heroism and heaven .
and what do i do ?
you go home and feel bad about it .
oh , this is me .
thank you .
it &apos;s a good job offer .
twice what you &apos;re making now .
think about it .
you look deep in thought .
i was .
you must be very happy .
yes . except for the dcc trying to kill us &apos; cause they &apos;re a bunch of idiots .
the residency suit ; i saw .
yes , well ,
in the waning days of a campaign the mudslinging can get ...
pretty ugly .
sounds like you &apos;re preparing me for something .
petra moritz , the reporter ,
has a rumor .
okay .
it &apos;s completely bogus ,
but she wants a quote from you .
and the rumor ?
there was another woman in peter &apos;s past .
i wouldn &apos;t drag you into this ,
but unless i can get you on the phone with her ,
she &apos;s gonna run with it .
and i know i promised never to ask you , but ...
peter &apos;s so close .
and this kind of rumor , it could ruin us .
i &apos;ll think about it .
i need to know soon .
i &apos;ll think about it .
nothing further , your honor .
mrs. joyce ...
first of all , let me just say how sorry i am for your loss .
i mean , my wife means everything to me .
and i ... i can &apos;t imagine how you feel .
unfortunately , this is a trial , so i have to ask you
some ... tough questions .
ask away .
were you and your husband having marital difficulties ?
we &apos;d had some issues , on and off ,
but we were working through them .
in fact , you had an affair , is that right ?
no . i was unfaithful to my husband once ,
on a business trip .
it was hardly an affair .
but your husband , he knew ?
your honor , i think we &apos;ve ascertained the facts here .
i &apos;m inclined to agree . mr. canning .
of course , your honor ,
i &apos;m just trying to establish
that there could &apos;ve been alternative causes
for martin joyce &apos;s suicide .
my husband was depressed
because of how they treated him at his job .
but he was depressed .
did he seek treatment ?
yes . he saw our doctor and a therapist .
and did those doctors prescribe any medications ?
he prescribed a number of drugs .
escitalopram , uh , bupropion .
none of them seemed to help .
what about elvatyl ?
did he prescribe a drug called elvatyl ?
yes .
mrs. joyce , are you aware of the side effects of elvatyl ?
objection , your honor .
okay , deep breath .
他不可继续代表任何这些当事人
this is a complete conflict of interest , your honor .
mr. canning defended the makers of elvatyl
just last year in a lawsuit against us .
and now he intends to pin mr. joyce &apos;s suicide
on the side effects of his former client &apos;s product ?
actually , that company no longer exists , your honor .
the rights to the name elvatyl were sold to a new company ,
and i owe them no duty .
and what evidence do you intend to present ? uh ...
it &apos;s a video showing how
elvatyl results in violent and suicidal behavior .
now , as you &apos;ll see ...
your honor , last year we
had exactly the same ... we had this very ...
okay , okay , one at a time .
this is our exhibit , your honor .
we used it last year
in a lawsuit against mr. canning &apos;s client .
that &apos;s why they should have no objection to me using it
for the same purpose ,
to show that elvatyl causes suicidal thoughts .
this is outrageous , your honor .
my goodness .
they &apos;re really going at it , aren &apos;t they ?
look , i got another hour here .
i just want to talk , that &apos;s all .
so give me a call when you get this .
we still have the other two employees who committed suicide
who weren &apos;t taking elvatyl .
it &apos;s odd about stern , isn &apos;t it ?
it was so sudden .
yeah . i saw him the day before .
he seemed normal .
tammy ?
yes .
she talked to me the other day .
here .
her sister told her i was the reason you broke up with her .
i told tammy
there was nothing anymore .
whatever was between us back then .
thank you . it &apos;s complicated .
i know .
everything is .
okay , who &apos;s karen ?
karen who ?
is there anybody here
who thinks marty is good at his job ?
huh ? anybody ?
oh , come on , there must be somebody . madelyn ?
phil ? what about you , karen ?
the other names joined our class action .
who &apos;s karen ?
karen jennings .
she worked in the benefits department ,
and she was a friend of martin joyce &apos;s .
she didn &apos;t want to join the class .
why not ?
thank you .
five minutes .
the key with petra is to keep cool .
she &apos;ll try to get a rise out of you .
petra .
yes , ms. moritz , it &apos;s alicia florrick .
ah , right on time . i appreciate that .
i &apos;m here , too , petra .
you have five minutes .
oh , eli . like a guardian angel .
i better get started , then .
so , mrs. florrick , your husband cheated on you
with a prostitute named amber madison .
are you aware of any other infidelities ?
no .
specifically someone from his past .
maybe someone that he worked with ,
or someone you both knew socially ?
no .
because you &apos;re aware that a source has approached me
with what are claimed to be substantiated
allegations of sexual conduct ?
mr. gold informed me of this .
i think the closer we get to an election ,
the more the rumor @-@ mongering turns less into a sport
and more into a strategy .
uh ... tell me what you mean by that .
voters are often moved by last @-@ minute rumors
because there is no adequate time to refute them ,
and so that &apos;s why they become part of a strategy
to hurt your opponent .
so , you believe that wendy scott @-@ carr
is behind these rumors ?
no .
i think there are people who want to hurt both candidates .
so , your husband has sworn to you
that there was only the prostitute ?
i won &apos;t discuss personal conversations .
that sounds like you &apos;re saying no .
no , that &apos;s saying that what my husband and i discuss
is not your business .
because there &apos;s a private sphere and a public sphere ?
yes .
and
if your husband abused his office by sleeping with a coworker ,
and he lied to the people closest to him--
his wife and his children ,
do you think the electorate should trust him ?
mrs. florrick ?
so ...
let me ask you one last question .
did you have an aids test ?
how dare you , petra ! go to hell !
so keep my cool , huh ?
yeah , i @-@ i don &apos;t always follow my own advice .
what are you doing here ?
my job .
you ?
i &apos;m following you .
look ... wiley knows .
he knows something &apos;s missing from matan &apos;s interview with blake ,
and i know andrew wiley .
he &apos;s not gonna stop until he finds out what it is .
so , i talked to matan again .
he &apos;s sitting on it .
as long as peter wins , he &apos;ll keep quiet .
it &apos;s wiley you have to worry about .
why did you just say that ?
what ?
&quot; as long as peter wins . &quot;
you know .
why didn &apos;t you just tell alicia ?
if you just would have been upfront with her ,
none of this would matter .
cary .
or is that why you became friends with her in the first place ?
so , uh , martin was a friend of yours ?
work friends , you know .
were you aware that he was taking anti @-@ depressants ?
you know , the defense have suggested
that he might have had a reaction
to his last medication .
you mean the elvatyl ?
yeah .
i @-@ i don &apos;t see how . he never took it .
he ... ? how @-@ how do you know ?
when he told me he was going on it ,
i gave him articles on the side effects .
he got scared .
ms. jennings , we &apos;re gonna need you to testify .
i don &apos;t want to get involved .
where do you work now ?
where ?
yeah . company fired you a year ago ,
so did you manage to find a new job ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
i was just wondering
how you afforded the new mercedes in your driveway .
they looted the pension fund .
the executives-- 35 million .
that &apos;s why they were so desperate to shed workers .
it wasn &apos;t to keep jobs from being sent overseas .
they needed to cut expenses
so they could use their funds to cover the shortfall .
how do you know this ?
karen jennings .
she uncovered the fraud
when she was working in the benefits department .
she went to kim palmieri with it .
and palmieri bought her off ?
it &apos;s criminal fraud .
maybe even a rico case .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t help us .
once it goes public ,
sure , the executives will go to jail , but ...
the feds seize the company &apos;s assets .
yes .
oh , that &apos;s perfect .
we &apos;re sitting on knowledge of a massive fraud ,
and we can &apos;t do anything about it
because we need the company to stay viable .
maybe we can do something with it .
all rise .
i ... seem to have misplaced my gavel .
uh , i hope that doesn &apos;t undercut my authority here .
court is now in session .
do you have any more witnesses , mr. gardner ?
yes , your honor .
the plaintiffs call karen jennings to the stand .
uh , your honor ,
this witness was not on the plaintiffs &apos; witness list .
not by name , your honor , but we specifically
reserved the right to call any former company employees ,
and your honor does like to err on the side of admitting evidence .
uh , yes , i do .
i also like to be unpredictable .
and yet here i find myself the height of predictability .
uh , i will allow .
your honor , we &apos;d like to ask for a recess at this time .
oh , i think it can wait until
it &apos;s your turn for a cross @-@ examine , mr. canning .
your honor ...
... we &apos;d like to ask for a recess to confer with opposing counsel .
looks like the rocket ship &apos;s coming along .
yeah . so , what &apos;s up ?
talked to matan .
he stonewalled me , too , but ,
uh , i think i @-@ i know what he &apos;s after .
i &apos;m just asking you to show a little discretion .
with ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s personal . it &apos;s not criminal .
but childs will use it .
why are you protecting her , cary ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not protecting her .
you went to see her after you talked to matan .
what , are you following me ?
i &apos;m doing my job .
just wondering why you &apos;re not doing yours .
the company executives were looting the pension fund .
well , if that &apos;s true , it &apos;s a problem .
but it &apos;s also a problem for you .
you can &apos;t go to the authorities with it ,
not unless you want to kiss your settlement good @-@ bye .
oh , we &apos;re talking settlement now ?
it depends on the number .
without admitting anything ,
it &apos;s gonna be hard for the company to afford much
without running out of money to pay back the alleged fraud .
yes . which is why kim palmieri is going to make up the difference ,
mr. canning , personally .
why would she do that ?
because karen jennings
kept a record of every executive who took part in the fraud ,
and kim palmieri &apos;s name is on that list .
so either she ponies up ,
or we &apos;ll see how the u.s. attorney reacts .
my guess is he &apos;ll start by freezing the company assets ,
and then he &apos;ll move on to hers .
double the salary .
you deserve it .
i &apos;m happy , but thank you .
hey , get on . we &apos;ll talk about it on the way down .
no , but again , thank you .
i don &apos;t bite .
actually , i think you do .
look , this isn &apos;t about your husband .
i think you &apos;re a good lawyer .
i also think you &apos;re this close to being a great lawyer ,
and lockhart &amp; gardner is not gonna get you there .
they encourage weakness .
and yet , we &apos;ve beaten you again .
do i look beaten ?
you called ?
you forgot your glasses .
i won a case ,
and i realized
i didn &apos;t have anyone to call .
who do you usually call when you win a case ?
no one .
okay . is this ... is this going somewhere ?
a lawyer i know died a few days ago ,
and it was like he was never here .
everyone just went back to normal .
death .
i should sit down for death , right ?
don &apos;t go to london .
i know it &apos;s selfish of me to say ,
but i don &apos;t want you to go to london .
maybe you should go to london .
shut up . shut up .
it &apos;s your career .
so what do we do now ?
