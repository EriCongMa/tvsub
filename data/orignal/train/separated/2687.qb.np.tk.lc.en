the sopranos 19
our undergrad student body at brown only numbers about 6000 people .
that &apos;s from every state in the country and over 60 countries in the world .
admission is extremely selective .

guy spends half an hour ...
... deciding between a $ 20 soccer ball and a $ 22 soccer ball .

that guy from bowdoin seems to be making some sense .
no , i mean the game tonight .
you guys want to be alone ?
i saw that refreshment table . i knew you &apos;d be around .
how do i get roped into this ?
charmaine knows with your sfogliatelle her daughter can go anywhere .

&quot; gee , dad , thanks for taking the time to come to this important event &quot; ?
how you doing , eric ?

yeah , it &apos;s a good school . a lot of star @-@ fucking though .
hey , latrine lip .
he &apos;s right .
he &apos;ll go where his mother says , like his old man .
you too ?
these guys were like namath and tittle .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard .
and now they &apos;re like phil donahue and alan alda .
listen , i heard ...
... through the grapevine you took your uncle &apos;s game .
you know , the big one .
grapevine ?
yeah .
if you listen close , that song says :
&quot; believe none of what you hear and half of what you see . &quot;
you know me . i like to play a little .
a little ?
forget it . this game &apos;s not for you .
no , it &apos;s just , you know , i was thinking it &apos;d be a kick .
david , you &apos;re a nice guy . i like you . okay ?
trust me , this game &apos;s not for you . i don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
these guys , they play deep .
know how many jockstraps i sell ?
not enough for this game .
okay ? forget it .
come on . let &apos;s go see what the y.o. from bucknell &apos;s got to say .
do you want to tell me what you &apos;re thinking ?
believe me , you don &apos;t want to know .
you want to know what l &apos;m thinking ? seriously ?
i &apos;d like to smash your face into hamburger .
okay .
i &apos;m not ...
don &apos;t worry .
i know i broke your coffee table and ...
it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
you asked , i told .
but you &apos;d like to smash my face .
not really .
it &apos;s just a way of describing how i &apos;m feeling .
making hamburger out of me would make you feel better ?
is this a woman thing ?
you ask me how i &apos;m feeling . i tell you how i &apos;m feeling .
and now you torture me with it ?
i don &apos;t know who the fuck i &apos;m angry at . i &apos;m just angry , okay ?
why the fuck am i here ? i even asked to come back .
i got the world by the balls and can &apos;t stop feeling like a fucking loser .
who makes you feel like a loser ? your mother ?
please , we wasted enough oxygen on that one .
it &apos;s everything and everybody .
i see some guy walking down the street , you know , with a clear head .
you know the type , he always whistles like the happy @-@ fucking @-@ wanderer .
i just want to go and rip his throat open .
i want to fucking grab him and pummel him right there for no reason .
why should i care if a guy &apos;s got a clear head ?
i should say , &quot; good for you . &quot;
let &apos;s get back to smashing my face .
jesus christ .
no , i think it all ties in .
all right . sometimes i resent you making me a victim .
that &apos;s all .
i make you feel like a victim ?
yeah .
remember the first time i came here i said ...
... the kind of man i admire
is gary cooper , the strong , silent type .
and how all americans are doing is crying and complaining .
a bunch of fucking pussies . fuck them !
and now i &apos;m one of them , a patient .
your parents made it impossible for you to experience joy .
see ? there you go again .
you said you &apos;re not the happy wanderer .
i &apos;m more like one of them ...
... than i am the jerkoffs i see leaving this office !
stop with the faces already . what do you got ?
three eights full . santa maria , yes !
santa maria ? more like santa claus .
did you cut the pot ?
twice .
here . make sure you spend it in my restaurant , you prick .
one chip ? mava &apos; a napoli , you can &apos;t even buy mcdonald &apos;s with that !
that &apos;s it , i gotta go .
come on , another hour .
i can &apos;t . charmaine &apos;ll have my balls on the menu tomorrow .
cash me out .
look at all the money !
rich , can i get another dime ?
we only got three players .
vito &apos;s up for it , right ?
where the fuck do i gotta be ? only , let &apos;s up the ante .
you &apos;re into me for seven g &apos;s already .
that &apos;s all ? i &apos;ll make that back from vito in an hour .
count this ciucio out another dime .
well , we have our work cut out for us .
gudren ?
meadow ?
i &apos;d like to talk to you .
it really sounds good . i know you &apos;re disappointed .
when you try out , the form asks what you want and i checked &quot; solo . &quot;
you seniors ! this is your last chance at cabaret .
gudren hasn &apos;t had a solo . i like to give everyone a shot .
mrs. gaetano , i was a sophomore when i did spider woman .
now it &apos;s important because of college .
you okay with this ?
do i have a choice ?
yeah , you could continue to run the game .
you know i &apos;m under fucking house arrest , you cute fuck .
then take it and be happy .
either way , l &apos;m having the executive game .
your father and me started that game 30 years ago .
we were talking one day about how credit card companies ...
... work their angle .
they didn &apos;t care what you bought if you don &apos;t pay all at once .
they juice you , you thank them for letting you have a card .
you &apos;d rather be juiced than pay at once .
that &apos;s a certain kind of player .
that &apos;s why we call it the executive game .
my brother johnny was keen .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s why he left us with cici beans .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
your father left livia with a package that could choke a fucking elephant .
i gotta tell you ?
she &apos;s like a woman with a ham , crying the blues because she has no bread .
please . they don &apos;t make them like johnny .
keep in mind that he paid freight for your uncle ercole , buon &apos; anima .
that was a major fucking nut .
who ? who the fuck is ecle ?
keep thinking you know everything .
some are so far behind in a race they believe they &apos;re leading .
yeah , that &apos;s cute . who the fuck is ecle ?
ercole . let &apos;s talk something else .
no , you opened this clam . who is he ?
you don &apos;t know him . it &apos;s water under the bridge .
me and your father looked out for him . he wanted for nothing .
i don &apos;t have time for this shit .
he was my younger brother , between me and your father in age .
his name was ercole . actually , ercole .
hercules , named after my grandfather .
what are you saying ?
i got another uncle ?
sharp as a fucking cue ball .
yeah , we had a brother you didn &apos;t know about because he was ..
it was different in those days .
my parents didn &apos;t speak english and couldn &apos;t take care of a kid like that .
but god bless your grandmother .
she went to every charity home in this fucking state ...
... till she found one to take care of him .
are you saying he was retarded ?
why don &apos;t you go fuck yourself ?
he was slow .
he was strong as a fucking bull , handsome like george raft .
if it was today , they might have trained him to be a whatever .
get him a job .
they didn &apos;t understand these things back then .
jesus .
what were we thinking ?
un @-@ fucking @-@ believable .
i remember my mother and father arguing about ... i don &apos;t know .
she kept talking about my father &apos;s feeble @-@ minded brother .
i thought she meant you .
what a kick in the balls . when did he die ?
not long before your father .
past is the past . this is the present .
let &apos;s talk about this game . what &apos;s my end ?
i don &apos;t know . ten percent .
twenty .
fifteen .
call your friends . let them know the game &apos;s happening .
can i help you with something , sir ?
yeah , i want to buy a boat with three propellers .
what ?
kid ...
... you see me here every week . when are you gonna stop asking ?
ho , rich !
is there a problem ?
i &apos;m just breaking your kid &apos;s balls .
like the pimp says to his hos , &quot; keep them coming . &quot;
rich , that envelope &apos;s two c &apos;s shy . i &apos;ll catch up on it next week .
it &apos;s no problem . i just got caught off guard .
i took a second on the house , didn &apos;t calculate it into my budget .
no good , davey .
it &apos;s just a stutter step . no biggie .
the difference gets tacked on to the principal .
and you know that .
yeah , i understand .
now don &apos;t take this personally ...
... but i don &apos;t want to see your face at my games until you &apos;re caught up .
come on , rich . that &apos;s not necessary .
you think i started this life ten minutes ago ?
a guy hands you a light envelope , it &apos;s just the beginning .
nothing personal .
i know , but it &apos;s just this ...
i know .
it &apos;s just a stutter step .
what kind is that ?
brazilian snapper .
is it fishy ?
it &apos;s fish .
you know what i mean . it &apos;s for pizzaiola , let me smell one .
you want something ?
give me enough of that for 15 people .
and ten pounds of shrimp .
there &apos;s gonna be some serious money . this is no nickel @-@ and @-@ dime shit .
these motherfuckers can play for two days straight .
now once you start work , you don &apos;t go until the game breaks up ...
... and that fucking place looks like an operating room .
you mean we &apos;re , like , cleaning guys ?
what are you doing ?
something ain &apos;t right .
i saw you put your finger on the scale .
no , i didn &apos;t .
pull that with old ladies , not me .
i didn &apos;t put my finger on the scale .
i don &apos;t believe this shit .
where you going ? wrap that up !
i gotta weigh ...
you gotta what ? rob me ?
yeah , you serve some booze , empty the ashtrays .
that reminds me .
whatever you do , don &apos;t engage silvio in conversation .
he can be a sick fuck when he &apos;s gambling .
once he was down 50 large .
he sneezes , fritzi says &quot; salute . &quot;
fritzi neste from hoboken ?
yeah , you know him ?
no .
then shut up and let me finish . anyway , fritzi says &quot; salute . &quot;
silvio thinks he said something else .
for the rest of the night , silvio blamed fritzi for his losing streak .
what did he think he said ?
are you listening ?
he &apos;s a fucking nut . who knows ?
here .
i didn &apos;t put my finger on no scale .
put that shit in the trunk so it don &apos;t stink up the car .
pay for the fish .

ali , maybe . he had a little wisdom .
well , at least tom , sr. isn &apos;t the happy wanderer anymore .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
he got his . you don &apos;t have to pummel his ass .
he &apos;s joined the ranks of the unlucky .
maybe you know what you &apos;re talking about , but i don &apos;t .
found out i had another uncle . a retarded uncle .
my father &apos;s brother that nobody told me about .
you believe this shit ?
was he seriously developmentally disabled ?
serious ? no , he had everybody in stitches back then .
now that you found out you have a retarded family member ...
... do you feel better about coming here ?
what ?
is it permissible now ?
is it enough of a sad tragedy that you can join the rest of the douche bags ?
i was talking to him a couple days ago .

that &apos;s the tax you get for raising your hands at my game .
i get mine , then you get yours . that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna be .
i don &apos;t do something , how &apos;s it gonna look ?
if everyone could please take their seats .
we are about to begin .
in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost . amen .
since it has pleased almighty god to call our brother from this life ...
... we commit his body to the earth to return to that from which it was made .
christ was the first to rise from the dead ...
you shouldn &apos;t take shit from him .

welcome , everyone , to cabaret night .
as we are recording tonight &apos;s show , we &apos;d like to remind everyone :
please , no talking , no pictures or videotaping .
and please remember to turn off those pagers and cell phones .
if you think you may need a lozenge ...
... may we suggest that now would be the time to unwrap it ...
... as opposed to during the performance .
program notes : ln the second act , &quot; sun and moon &quot;
... to be performed by eric scatino and meadow soprano , has been canceled .
regretfully , mr. scatino will not be performing tonight .
instead , ms. soprano will perform a solo ...
... singing &quot; my heart will go on , &quot; the theme song from titanic .
enjoy the show .
