this is it , max .
the first private party we &apos;ve booked in our cupcake shop .
what ? you said it was a private party ,
and this is a party i keep near my privates .
fine , but they can &apos;t smell it on your breath ,
so eat a mint after .
no need . it &apos;s peppermint schnapps ,
&apos;cause i think ahead .
i think this calls for a &quot; first party &quot; dance .
* first par @-@ tay *
* who gonna have a first par @-@ tay *
* we gon &apos; have a first par @-@ tay *
that &apos;s the exact same dance you did
when the humane society sent you free puppy address labels .
* address labels *
* who got doggies on an envelope *
* who got doggies on an envelope *
* i need another sip of this *
* wish i had something stronger *
max , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help it .
i &apos;m just so excited my genius marketing ideas
are finally starting to pay off .
quiet ! quiet !
quiet ! quiet !
if you aren &apos;t listening ,
cupcake max can &apos;t teach you how to decorate .
it &apos;s weird how sex is so great ,
and yet , it makes these .
ho ho ho !
talking to you , max .
i know . what &apos;s up , andy ?
i brought some christmas candy from my shop for the diner .
look , max , santa did come .
from just a kiss ?
well , you didn &apos;t see what she was doing with her hands .
i taught her that .
that &apos;s my gift to you . merry christmas .
hey , is everything okay with your shop ?
&apos;cause the landlord came into my store today
and mentioned you guys hadn &apos;t paid your rent .
if there &apos;s a problem , i &apos;d be more than happy to help .
well , the fact is , we just don &apos;t have--
don &apos;t have a clue why our online payments
just never go through . technology , right ?
you used to be able to shake the mailman &apos;s hand .
now it &apos;s all holograms and lasers .
grandma &apos;s right , those were the days .
it was a more honest time .
okay . well , i gotta go .
a kiss for caroline .
oh , that was a new kind of kiss .
i liked it .
max taught me .
what &apos;s with the lies ? just tell him the truth .
we can &apos;t pay our rent , life sucks ,
and you need wine before oral .
no need .
we still have two other private parties set up for this month :
the quinceanera for that pregnant girl ,
and then her baby shower .
plus , the holidays are coming ,
so we should get our decorations up asap ,
or santa won &apos;t know where to find us .
oh , he &apos;ll know where to find us .
we &apos;ll be the two evicted girls
eating fruitcake out of a dumpster .
oh , look , here comes one of the reindeers now .
you look like a korean coat rack .
everybody can stop looking .
we found the grinch .
no wonder it &apos;s so angry , it &apos;s working for minimum wage .
oh , you &apos;re hanging the christmas decorations .
i already put up the mistletoe .
where ?
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s very well @-@ hung .
well , all my checks are in ,
so i have to run and make a cupcake delivery .
here , take this and put it in the till .
i did a cupcake run last night too .
wait , who orders cupcakes at 2 : 00 a.m. ?
um , my friends .
you don &apos;t have any friends .
i have so many friends .
who are your friends ?
some people i know .
then how come i &apos;ve never met them ?
well , they don &apos;t like you .
but they don &apos;t know me .
they don &apos;t like what they &apos;ve heard about you .
but who would they have heard things from but you ?
maybe from my other group of friends .
they don &apos;t like you either . later .
max , you can turn around .
that &apos;s right , i followed you .
sorry for following you .
it &apos;s just , you have the hair and jacket of a woman .
in a good way .
did you actually think that was me ?
my beard is much thicker .
well , where are we going ?
why are we in this seedy building
that smells like marijuana ?
oh , my god , is this where your mom lives ?
you think my mom lives indoors ?
okay , look , for the last few nights ,
my dealer calls me after she sells pot to people ,
and then i sell those people the munchies they need .
max , this is new york . that &apos;s illegal !
no , giant sodas are illegal .
this is me selling cupcakes to make our rent .
and besides , it &apos;s not a big deal .
pot &apos;s legal in washington , massachusetts ,
colorado , and california .
well , thank you for the stoner &apos;s summary of the last election ,
but we don &apos;t live in any of those places ,
and i do not approve of pot at all .
it makes people lazy and lethargic ,
and drains all one &apos;s ambitions .
god , you &apos;re fun .
look , on the other side of this door
is money to help us make the $ 600 more we need for rent .
it &apos;s totally up to you .
should i knock , or not knock ?
what &apos;s good , max ?
hey , keefer . this is my friend caroline .
pleasure , my goddess .
come on in . i just broke out some dank nugs .
oh , thanks , but we actually just had some dank nugs .
first of all , that &apos;s your new nickname ,
and , keefer , i don &apos;t want to rush you ,
but me and dank nugs have to get home .
okay , cool , i &apos;ll be right back with the cash .
second @-@ hand smoke , second @-@ hand smoke .
second @-@ hand nerd , second @-@ hand nerd .
here you go ,
they were feeling kinda generous .
nice to meet you , nugs .
nice meeting you too .
peace .
there . a hundred bucks .
oh , my god , max , that &apos;s a hundred @-@ dollar bill !
how easy was that ?
and we didn &apos;t even have to open the shop .
i mean , what is the problem with doing this ?
you &apos;re right , i overreacted .
we &apos;re not selling pot . we &apos;re selling cupcakes .
we didn &apos;t break any laws .
there &apos;s nothing illegal about it .
move ! move ! move !
i didn &apos;t know ! i didn &apos;t know !
go ! go ! go ! keep going , now !
police ! go ! go , now !
put the meth down ! put the meth down !
&apos;sup ?
move ! go ! go ! get him out ! let &apos;s go !
bring him out ! go ! go ! go !
i told you not to get involved with drugs !
i told you !
shut it , carol ! shut it !
i can &apos;t believe that just happened .
i know , it &apos;s like , &quot; let it go , carol . &quot;
we &apos;re done with drugs . i was right .
and now you know why my friends don &apos;t like you .
and remember , we do private parties ,
wedding parties , birthday parties--
all right , there &apos;s a dozen . what &apos;s the special occasion ?
my cat died .
we also do funerals , divorces ...
and sad friday nights alone .
thank you .
okay , so that &apos;s 48 more dollars .
now , all we need is
for 72 more cats to die .
max , there &apos;s no need to kill imaginary cats .
let &apos;s just send out positive energy ,
and the universe will provide .
swing and a miss , universe .
surprise ! i was in the neighborhood
and thought i &apos;d stop by and say hello .
under any other circumstance , i &apos;d say , &quot; never do that again , &quot;
but today , i &apos;m saying , &quot; how many cupcakes do you want &quot; &quot;
and i &apos;m thinking of a number between 10 and 20 .
i &apos;m kind of trying to watch my waist .
well , you &apos;re closer to it than most people .
i &apos;m gonna start you with 12 cupcakes .
full price , &apos; cause you &apos;re family .
oh , my god ! the phone ringing
and a customer at the same time ?
see , max , it &apos;s all happening .
between the money we just got last night
and that pregnant girl &apos;s quinceanera / baby shower ,
we &apos;re gonna make our rent .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
oh , hola , estella .
si , the quinceanera / baby shower .
que ?
oh , no . deported ?
oh , you can &apos;t afford it .
my mal .
well , sorry , it didn &apos;t work out . gracias for calling .
well , that &apos;s disappointing ,
but we should have seen it coming .
she couldn &apos;t afford condoms either .
it &apos;s cool .
i &apos;ll just call keefer
and try to do a couple more cupcake runs .
no , that &apos;s not cool , that &apos;s dangerous .
it &apos;ll all work out . you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna go over and ask andy
if he &apos;ll float us some cash till the holiday rush kicks in .
he did offer .
we should put up some christmas lights ,
a menorah for chanukah , and for kwanzaa ...
while i &apos;m gone , why don &apos;t you wikipedia kwanzaa ?
well ... here &apos;s the first eight .
and how many cupcakes would you like &quot; to go &quot; ?
i &apos;m thinking of a number between 40 and 50 .
how come you never push the food at the diner like this ?
oh , that &apos;s where i know you from .
start eating .
i didn &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s so not hot . he &apos;s my boyfriend .
i mean , it &apos;s not like borrowing money from family .
you don &apos;t sleep with your family .
not all families are the same , caroline .
besides , we &apos;re fine . the universe will provide .
well , the universe better provide in ,
like , a second , &apos; cause look , there &apos;s the landlord .
he just went into that moroccan place .
what are we gonna do ?
hide !
what ?
well , i should go .
it &apos;s too late for that !
lock the door , hit the lights ,
and crawl over here , and stay low !
stay down till we &apos;re out of sight .
ow , it hurts !
oh , please . like this is the first time
you &apos;ve been on your knees in the bathroom .
caroline , you don &apos;t have to stay on the ground anymore .
i feel like this is where i belong now .
yo , baker girls .
max , he &apos;s in the shop .
okay , go , out the window .
really ?
if he can &apos;t see us , he can &apos;t evict us .
go .
it &apos;s a little high . are you sure ?
you &apos;ve heard &quot; when god closes a door , he opens a window &quot; ?
he &apos;s running from his landlord .
go .
okay , here goes .
i love you , max .
what about me ? what should i do ?
put the money for those cupcakes on the counter .
who are you ?
no hablo ingles ?
all right , all right , good news .
i just found $ 3 in my pocket .
oh , and a peanut m &amp; m ,
so we don &apos;t have to spend money on dinner .
caroline , why are you putting it off ?
you know what you have to do .
go over to the couch and put your hands in that crack .
it &apos;s every poor girl &apos;s rite of passage .
what ?
i think something just licked me .
i &apos;ll just check our purses . here &apos;s yours .
uh , no , no , no . i already checked that .
there &apos;s nothing in mine ...
except that baggie of pot
that keefer gave me as a christmas present .
max , this is not a christmas present .
this is a giant , illegal , fat sack of weed .
yeah , with a rudolph sticker ,
which makes it a christmas present .
see ? his nose and his eyes are red .
i want this out of my sight . you gotta get rid of it .
well , it &apos;s gonna take me
at least 45 minutes to smoke all that .
max , i &apos;m serious ,
i &apos;m not comfortable with that fat sack of weed .
stop saying &quot; fat sack of weed . &quot;
you &apos;re like someone &apos;s dad overusing the word &quot; awesome . &quot;
i &apos;ll just put it up here ,
next to the half a vicodin i was saving for new year &apos;s .
oh , no ! the pot !
the pot is in the pot !
it &apos;s in the butter i was using to make cupcakes .
maybe this is the universe &apos;s way
of telling you to stop doing drugs .
or is it telling us to sell them ?
max , we are not that desperate .
we &apos;re not making pot cupcakes .
i &apos;d rather just see what the holidays bring .
well , this isn &apos;t bethlehem , it &apos;s brooklyn .
there &apos;s no frankincense and myrrh ,
there &apos;s only frankenberry and &quot; myrrh @-@ ajuana . &quot;
these turned out great !
good idea , universe .
i knew you smoked weed .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe the smell .
it &apos;s like a skunk skunked a skunk .
i know . it &apos;s like a port @-@ a @-@ potty
on the last day of coachella .
oh , no , chestnut &apos;s smelling this .
i got my horse stoned .
oh , relax .
he &apos;s just trying to fit in at school .
do you think the neighbors can smell it ?
do you think they &apos;re gonna call the cops ?
chill out !
how can someone be this paranoid before they &apos;re high ?
here , taste this .
max , i don &apos;t do pot .
i tried it a couple times in college .
it totally changed my personality .
then please have some pot right now .
come on , it &apos;s business .
i need you to taste it and tell me how it is ,
&apos;cause i can &apos;t tell . at this point ,
everything i put in my mouth tastes like pot .
hey , it &apos;s pretty good .
in fact , it &apos;s kind of delicious .
we should charge 15 apiece for these .
that &apos;s $ 540 . that &apos;s our rent .
a few more bites of that cupcake ,
and that math would &apos;ve taken two hours longer .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s the cops !
it &apos;s probably that same swat team !
i told you not to get involved with drugs !
i told you !
shut it , caroline ! shut it !
relax , it &apos;s sophie .
hi , girls . i got my period .
yeah , i got killer cramps .
it &apos;s like i got a tractor in my uterus .
sophie , we &apos;re sorry you &apos;re not feeling well .
yeah , you know , it &apos;s times like these i think god &apos;s a bitch .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
what &apos;s that smell ?
nothing . it &apos;s nothing .
maui wowie !
oh , you girls have been holding out on me !
oh ! all right ! okay !
this is what i &apos;m talking about !
oh , my god , good @-@ bye , killer cramps !
hello , pot party !
i am picking up what you are laying down .
i think we found our new product spokesperson .
here it is .
i &apos;ve been here once before with keefer .
judah &apos;s a really chill guy , kind of a tech genius .
think we can probably sell them all here .
are you okay ?
you haven &apos;t spoken the entire way over here ,
which is either a side effect of the pot ,
or my early christmas present .
no , i &apos;m fine . i feel exactly the same .
it hasn &apos;t changed me at all .
careful with the box ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re smearing the cupcakes .
oh , what does it matter ? we &apos;re all gonna die .
is this that other personality you were telling me about ?
no , it &apos;s still me . not that i matter .
none of us do . we &apos;re all gonna die .
oh , crap .
hey , max !
i was so happy that you called .
and we &apos;re so happy you &apos;re addicted to marijuana .
you know it always leads to heroin--
which leads to death . we get it .
you &apos;re the one not @-@ fun stoner .
hey , guys , the chicks are here with the edibles .
edibles !
we &apos;re having a little bit of a celebration .
okay , so cupcakes .
they &apos;re 15 apiece , good quality .
and guys , we have to sell all of them , or tomorrow ,
we &apos;ll be eating out of a dumpster .
does anyone have any uppers ?
i have to sit down . i mean , life . ugh !
i &apos;m so tired of pretending it &apos;s all gonna be okay .
it &apos;s not .
you should get that mole checked out .
i don &apos;t feel good about it .
dude , this chick is freaking me out .
just take it easy , dave . we &apos;ll just get some food in her .
i got a buddy on the way with pizza .
guys , i &apos;m sorry about her .
it &apos;s like bringing your mother to a strip club .
not for me . that &apos;d be like taking my mom to work .
strippers , how about their lives ?
they got no way out .
can i talk to you , before you start performing
an acoustic ballad about strippers with moles ?
what &apos;s the point , max ?
go , if you &apos;re gonna hit me , hit me .
what is happening with you ?
i didn &apos;t even know blonde people could be sad .
max , i have to tell you something .
come here . it &apos;s a secret . come here .
we &apos;re not gonna make it .
but you &apos;re the one who &apos;s always telling me
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
yeah , i was lying .
where &apos;s the weed , homeslizzy ?
perfect timing , andy .
these are the girls who are selling edibles .
no , that &apos;s my girlfriend , caroline .
that sucks for you , dude .
what are you doing here ?
she is really getting the hang of that .
and around 4 : 00 a.m. ,
you finally called me from an ihop in greenpoint ,
and i came and picked you up .
you were covered in syrup , yelling ,
&quot; the mayans were right ! the mayans were right ! &quot;
there &apos;s my little stoner .
andy , i don &apos;t get stoned .
it was just last night .
i know .
you told me all about it when you called at 4 : 00 a.m.
sorry , and i &apos;m mortified to ask ,
but did you and i have phone sex ?
that was you and me .
stoned caroline &apos;s got game .
hey , max told me about the rent .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you guys needed help ?
i guess i just didn &apos;t want to have to admit
to you or to myself that we &apos;re in real trouble .
plus , being a charity instead of a girlfriend is so not hot .
uh , there is nothing you can do that is not hot .
oh , then whatever you do , do not look at the video
max has of me , rolling around in the ihop parking lot ,
covered in syrup .
i want you to have this .
cash it , don &apos;t cash it . do whatever you want ,
but just know that my success doesn &apos;t mean anything
if i can &apos;t share it with you .
thank you .
andy , that is so amazing , and i really appreciate it ,
but i can &apos;t take it .
well , it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
at least it got your hand in my pants .
and remember , if you ever need it , it &apos;s there .
i &apos;m talking about my penis .
andy offered to pay our rent , but i said no .
that is the whitest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
it was really sweet of him ,
but i didn &apos;t want to take money from a man i &apos;m sleeping with .
wait , are you telling me there are women
who don &apos;t take money from men they &apos;re sleeping with ?
what &apos;s gonna happen , max ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we do have christmas decorations ,
so let &apos;s put them up .
wait a minute .
you &apos;re the one pushing christmas ?
who are you , me ?
no , i still have my dignity .
speaking of christmas , here are the two and a half wise men .
what &apos;s up ?
caroline called me last night .
told me that you two couldn &apos;t pay your rent ,
that you were losing the shop .
that girl can talk .
she called me too , and said you didn &apos;t have your rent ,
and also that , for sure , the rising waters of the ocean
will swallow us and kill us all .
so we put together what we had , and ... here .
consider it an early christmas gift from all three of us ...
even though i gave 350 , earl gave 100,
and he gave 50 .
thank you , but we can &apos;t take it .
yes , you can . we &apos;re family .
500 whole dollars ?
thank you , guys .
and we have something special for you .
what makes it special ?
the love she puts into &apos; em , max .
you can smell the love all around her .
you know , max , i think we &apos;re gonna make it .
i like not @-@ stoned caroline .
we &apos;re gonna keep you off the drugs .
you mean because i &apos;m more positive ?
no , &apos; cause we may have to sell your urine for next month &apos;s rent ,
and i &apos;m gonna need that pee clean .
