mom !
wilden was obsessed with
trying to pin alison &apos;s murder on my friends .
mona made a full confession .
did you girls put her up to this ...
thinking it would somehow help ashley ?
what makes you so sure that she didn &apos;t do it ?
things she said in her confession
contradict some of the evidence .
you weren &apos;t listed as his father on his birth certificate .
i don &apos;t ... have any rights ?
not until you establish paternity .
we have to face facts .
3,000 miles is a long way .
we &apos;re not gonna be together next year .
dr. palmer said to watch out for the blond girl .
any chance that he meant cece ?
you can &apos;t leave the house unless it &apos;s for a court date
or a medical appointment ?
that ... tracks where i am .
oh , my god !
jenna ?
did somebody push her in ?
think somebody hit her first .
feel safe when i &apos;m with you .
i still think we should dip
into those candy @-@ striper outfits one more time .
what difference would that have made ?
well , we could &apos;ve talked to jenna
instead of getting turned away at the visitor &apos;s desk .
guys ! can you keep it down , please ?
whole point was to sneak back .
i think mr. facinelli noticed that our entire row was missing .
well-- i &apos;d still like to graduate .
oh , news flash--
honey , none of us are graduating .
okay , i still think that spencer to get back to shana
and see if she &apos;ll say more .
what ? why ?
because ... !
if cece drowned jenna ,
then she must know the reason .
and why exactly do we trust shana ?
why do we trust jenna ?
all right , well i don &apos;t trust anybody ,
and you guys are about as quiet as a monster truck rally .
now shut up .
fine . i &apos;m going to the source .
&quot; the source &quot; ?
cece &apos;s been a.w.o.l. since wilden was alive .
you &apos;re not just gonna find her
folding peasant skirts at the diva dish right now .
well , then i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll search every hipster boutique
until i do find her .
no friggin &apos; way .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
is it an &quot; a &quot; text ?
worse . it &apos;s my mother .
mrs. dilaurentis has offered to let us stay with her .
in ali &apos;s house ?
you &apos;re gonna sleep in ali &apos;s old bed ?
no ! hell no . i &apos;m not moving in there .
yes , you are .
em , you have to .
it might be our best chance to find cece .
you could &apos;ve been a little more sensitive .
she &apos;s homeless right now ,
and you just convinced her to stay in our dead friends &apos; room .
yeah , well our friend is close with cece .
maybe there &apos;s something there that can help us track her down .
that room is freaky .
ali &apos;s mom turned it into a shrine .
&apos;kay , you wanna talk about &quot; freaky &quot; ?
look at the guy who hangs out
at the ice machine at emily &apos;s motel .
he crushes ice with his armpit .
she should just ask her mom
if she can come stay with us .
i don &apos;t think my mom &apos;s taking any guests at the moment .
she &apos;s having a hard enough time getting dressed in the morning .
would a guest be a good distraction ?
as much as she loves emily ,
i don &apos;t think she wants to cry in front of her .
let &apos;s talk later , okay ?
okay .
do you want me to give that a try ?
actually picked a few locks in my time .
no . no , thanks .
i @-@ i &apos;ll just go back down to the janitor &apos;s office .
was hoping to avoid that .
second time i &apos;ve done this today .
mr. fitz ?
here .
thank you .
so does that forwarding address belong to cece ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not sure yet .
how are you not sure ?
it &apos;s a box at the post office , hanna .
she &apos;s not gonna jump out like a girl in a birthday cake
and yell , &quot; boo . &quot;
so what did you find ?
i tracked down an unpaid cable bill
that was sent to that p.o. box .
how &apos;d you do that ?
do you really wanna know ?
i mean , it &apos;s gonna involve me talking about firewalls and code .
okay , no . i don &apos;t .
that cable bill is attached to a physical address in philly .
where cece may or may not be watching sportscenter right now ?
it &apos;s a long shot ,
but it &apos;s worth a try .
these action shots are sick .
you made me look like i know what i &apos;m doing .
this one &apos;s my favorite .
thanks .
thank you .
i wish i could use one of these for the match tonight .
the picture i gave &apos; em was so old , i look ...
like an altar boy .
what--what match tonight ?
it &apos;s no big deal .
um , it &apos;s a fight that requires a headshot .
it sounds like a pretty big deal to me .
it &apos;s regional championships .
well ...
it makes it sound like it &apos;s impressive ,
which it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s a bunch of fold @-@ out chairs and a gym that smells like feet .
no , i love it . can i come ?
it &apos;s taking a train to philly
to watch guys make zoolander faces at each other .
you ... you really wanna go ?
well , are you gonna be there ?
yeah .
then yes , i wanna go .
mona , would you please tell me
your emotional response to this picture ?
it &apos;s a family on a farm .
the sun is shining and they &apos;re smiling .
it &apos;s a happy picture .
so , how does that make you feel ?
happy .
what &apos;s your response ?
tell your artist to take a class ,
because this looks like norman rockwell sketched it
with his teeth .
that &apos;s not a feeling . that &apos;s an opinion .
i &apos;d like to know how you feel .
about farm animals ?
about what you say you &apos;ve done .
look , those girls ... used to make me feel bad .
but recently , i realized that ...
we &apos;re on the same side .
i wanted to make up for all the things i &apos;d done .
wilden was bothering them ,
so i got rid of him .
and i &apos;d do it again .
i don &apos;t think you got rid of anybody .
that &apos;s my response .
let &apos;s take a break .
like you to think about whether you &apos;re gonna be honest with me .
why would i ever be honest with you ?
used to be .
well that was before i realized
where your loyalties were .
i &apos;m not sure what that means .
but i thought we &apos;d done a good job
of establishing a sense of trust
while you &apos;ve been a patient here .
that was before i realized
that you were keeping secrets from me .
by the way , you forgot the &quot; g &quot; in &quot; diagnosis . &quot;
mona ...
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been keeping a secret .
and you &apos;re smart enough to know i was gonna figure it out .
figure what out ?
you stopped taking your medication .
i ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t stay here .
look at this . it &apos;s like a--
a museum .
ah--i know i promised hanna ,
but i can &apos;t do this .
okay , emily , just try to relax for a second .
look , when you think about it ,
putting back her room is really not that strange of a reaction .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m serious .
in the 19th century , when children died ,
their parents would sometimes pose them for lifelike photos
as mementos .
not helping .
not helping at all .
okay , well just try to remember that this is an opportunity .
you know , you could find some stuff in here
that could be really useful to us .
just not thrilled being here by myself .
wait , your mom &apos;s not gonna be here with you ?
no .
she has a hearing with the police department disciplinary committee .
she doesn &apos;t come back from harrisburg until tomorrow .
what about paige ?
can she come over ?
we &apos;re not exactly in the best place right now .
found everything you need ?
um ... yeah .
i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s so chilly .
furnace is acting up .
i &apos;ve called someone to come over and have a look at it .
can i get you girls anything ?
i have those vanilla wafers that you all used to like .
um ... no , thanks .
i should unpack .
i &apos;ll get you some hangars .
you know , i--
i don &apos;t really wear things that need to be hung up .
there are fresh towels in the linen closet ,
and ...
i made extra keys .
i really want you to make yourself at home here , emily .
i know that you and your mom have been through a lot .
thanks , mrs. d.
it &apos;s so nice to see you girls back in this room .
it &apos;s like you never left .
oh , i thought you and carbs weren &apos;t friends anymore .
we &apos;re not . it &apos;s for my mom .
she hasn &apos;t really eaten anything today .
where is she ?
shut up in her room .
if it wasn &apos;t for the phone calls from mrs. hastings ,
she probably wouldn &apos;t even get out of bed .
well , then , do you wanna go check out this address in philly ?
i mean , there &apos;s a train that leaves in , like , 40--
actually , uh , aria &apos;s gonna do that .
she &apos;s already gonna be out there . so ...
um , i was wondering if ...
maybe you &apos;d help me get into radley .
why would you wanna do that ?
this wouldn &apos;t happen to have anything to do with the fact
that mona has been moved there , would it ?
she &apos;s the only person who cece &apos;s reached out to .
they &apos;re doing a psych evaluation for a reason , hanna .
mona is helping my mom . she &apos;s--
no . first , &quot; a &quot; used a sedan as a wrecking ball on emily &apos;s house .
and then jenna shows up in a lake looking like soggy bread .
and now you wanna go to radley and ring the bell jar ?
so you &apos;re not coming with me ?
hanna , listen to yourself , okay ?
you are so desperate that you &apos;re willing
to go to the enemy for help .
mona is not the enemy anymore .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
hanna , i think it &apos;s time that you went to your parents
and the cops , and you told them that &quot; a &quot; is back .
no .
no . there &apos;s no way i &apos;m doing that !
telling them will only make it worse .
it can &apos;t get any worse .
god , just ...
give me some time to think this over .
i &apos;m gonna take this to my mom .
how have you been ?
sorry . stupid question .
i &apos;m a little fuzzy . i &apos;ve been working 72 hours straight ,
and this is my first break .
yeah . the nurse told me .
oh , so this isn &apos;t us running into each other so much as ...
i hunted you down .
well , then , how can i help you ?
if you could just please let me in to see mona--
hanna .
i don &apos;t even have to see her .
i just wanna talk to her .
hanna , you know i can &apos;t .
in fact , given your mother &apos;s situation ,
i probably shouldn &apos;t be talking to you .
but it &apos;s not about mona .
i &apos;m just wondering about cece .
cece ?
has she contacted you ?
or ...
why would cece contact me ?
spencer said that you let her in once before to see mona ,
and i was wondering if she thought that you would ... do it again .
what &apos;s wrong ?
no , nothing .
it &apos;s just the nurse said someone tried to see mona last night ,
and when she described a young blonde ,
i thought it was probably you .
it wasn &apos;t .
did she get in to see her ?
no , she was turned away .
well then why are you so worried ?
between you and me , ever since our budget was cut ,
the hospital &apos;s been a little short @-@ staffed .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying things have been missed .
that &apos;s all .
okay , well you have security cameras , right ?
i mean--uh ...
can &apos;t you see if it was her , right ?
hanna , i don &apos;t want to get involved .
oh , please .
please do this for me . it &apos;s important .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
thank you .
hi . we have a problem .
i &apos;ll take care of my end .
you take care of yours .
&quot; leave the lamb alone and go for the lion . &quot;
so , &quot; a &quot; is telling you to ditch eddie lamb
and go for dr. palmer .
but what &apos;s the deal with the sheet music ?
i recognized it as soon as i saw it .
you did ?
my mom used to play this song all the time .
i remember her playing it .
maybe ...
there &apos;s some--
there &apos;s something about my mom &apos;s connection to the music .
that &apos;s important .
yeah .
something that she shared in her sessions with dr. palmer .
will you come with me to see him ?
why ?
i mean , you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t need me .
you &apos;ve already met him once before .
because you &apos;re the only person
that i can talk to about this .
okay , well what do you want me to tell emily ?
&apos;cause i promised her that i &apos;d go back to that house--
you can &apos;t-- you can &apos;t tell her anything .
if you do , the faucet turns off ,
and &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t going to give me anything else .
and when does this end ?
what do you mean ?
i mean how much longer do you need me to keep this a secret ?
until i find out what happened--
what really happened to her .
looking for something , dear ?
yeah , i-- i was just gonna go and get something to eat .
well let me make you something . have a seat .
just pass that stuff out of the way .
my husband has decided to divorce me .
i &apos;m fine , really . i &apos;m just ...
dealing with the initial shock of it .
open it .
what is it ?
open it .
don &apos;t be afraid . you already know the truth .
i &apos;m the one that &apos;s ... late to the party .
what are you talking about ?
i saw a lawyer
to start the process of getting my name put on malcolm &apos;s
birth certificate .
ezra , how could you do that ?
i didn &apos;t want you to take
my son away from me .
i can &apos;t believe that you
would go behind my back .
oh , what do you care ?
this doesn &apos;t amount to much more than shadow boxing .
does it ?
you knew i wasn &apos;t his father .
caleb ?
um , i thought you were helping your mom the rest of the day .
i am . i just went to go drop some papers off
at spencer &apos;s mom &apos;s office .
caleb , what were you doing going into veronica &apos;s office building ?
i don &apos;t know how to protect you anymore .
so you were gonna tell her ? !
you were actually gonna tell her ? !
yes , i was .
okay , i would rather you hate me
and be safe than the other way around .
and you think telling her about &quot; a &quot; is gonna keep me safe ?
at the end of the day , she can do a lot more for you than i can .
you know , if some punk comes up to you in the street ,
i &apos;m gonna do whatever i can to lay him out .
but this enemy--
this enemy is everywhere
and--and nowhere at the same time .
i keep--
i keep taking swings in the dark , and i &apos;m missing .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m not enough to keep you safe anymore .
yes , you are .
just tell him to push back the meeting a half @-@ hour .
i had to pick up files from home .
thanks , anya . bye .
now what can i do for you ?
look , i know my history with the hastings
has been a bit ... rocky .
i &apos;m not going to debate that .
but regardless of whether you like me--
like you ?
you broke my daughter &apos;s heart
and took every piece of goodwill this family extended to you
and flushed it down the toilet .
why are you here , wren ?
i &apos;m here to warn you ...
about mona .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;s confessed to this murder ,
but ... you should be careful .
let me explain something to you .
i &apos;m a defense attorney .
i don &apos;t care why mona &apos;s confessed .
whether she did it or not , she &apos;s helped my case
by giving me an alternate explanation for the crime .
so--
and she may have done .
but she &apos;s going to turn the tables on you .
she &apos;s a dangerous person .
and she hasn &apos;t forgiven your daughter or her friends ,
despite what she says .
she wants to see them hurt ,
as well as the people closest to them ...
like ashley marin .
you know you could lose your medical license for telling me this ?
she &apos;s still your patient , isn &apos;t she ?
she is .
but if i hadn &apos;t made such a mess of things ...
you were once going to be my family .
we &apos;d been fighting a lot ... over dumb stuff .
and you were gonna be leaving for school at the end of summer--
so--what ? it &apos;s my fault ?
no .
i was mad at you .
i went to a party with some friends ,
had too much to drink--
i made a mistake .
so what are you trying to say ?
that you ... didn &apos;t know ?
you may have been confused then ,
but you haven &apos;t been confused for seven years , maggie .
i knew it was a question .
but i decided to answer it myself ,
and i gave myself
the answer that i wanted .
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t feel bad for you right now . i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
you let me believe he was my child .
i &apos;ve taken him to the movies ,
to baseball games .
i &apos;ve helped him with his homework .
we--
we have inside jokes .
i know that he--
he hates too much milk in his cereal .
and i know the names of every single one of his stuffed animals .
and i know exactly which one he needs
when he wakes up in the middle of the night .
you made me believe he &apos;s my--
he &apos;s my child .
i &apos;m sorry .
you let me fall in love with him .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i really am .
okay , well , if i don &apos;t get back soon ,
he &apos;s gonna think that it &apos;s weird .
i mean , gone with the wind took less time
than this fro @-@ yo run .
trust me , jake will still be kicking when you get back .
fine .
oh , but can you please check in on emily and see how she &apos;s doing ?
spencer said she was pretty creeped @-@ out when she left .
yeah . sure .
thanks . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
oh ! excuse me .
sorry .
you from the management company ?
i &apos;m here to--
because i told the lady on the phone
i &apos;ll move out , but as far as--
no , no--i &apos;m here looking for someone named cece drake .
well if you find her , let me know .
we grieved differently .
ken boxed up all of ali &apos;s things and put the house on the market ,
and i ....
felt her presence everywhere .
i even started seeing her .
what do you mean ?
i was jogging in the park and i saw this young woman ahead of me .
it was ali .
i could &apos;ve sworn .
the hair , the walk-- it was her .
i started running after her .
i practically tackled that poor girl .
so it wasn &apos;t ali ?
i lose a piece of her every day .
that &apos;s why i did the room .
if it were up to ken , he &apos;d just lock that bedroom door
and throw away the key .
you think you know somebody so well , but then ...
something that you both counted on changes , and ...
you find out who they really are .
just wish it hadn &apos;t taken me 24 years to learn that .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
no , i do .
i &apos;m going through it , myself .
someone i &apos;m dating .
we &apos;re becoming different people , but ...
keep trying to ignore that .
well what does he think ?
actually , i--
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t sure if you knew , but i guess not .
i &apos;m with a girl .
i realized that &apos;s who i want to be with ,
and that &apos;s who i am .
i &apos;m very proud of you , emily .
mrs. dilaurentis ,
i want you to know
that you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s seen ali .
i have , too .
of course you have .
you loved her as much as i did .
i wish that ali could &apos;ve returned those feelings .
i couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to love her than you .
when cece dropped out of upenn and left for l.a. ,
she was still paying rent .
at least , i thought she was .
she dropped out , or ...
she was kicked out ?
how &apos;d you know about that ?
i thought you said you weren &apos;t really &quot; girls &quot; with cece .
uh , i wasn &apos;t ,
but my friend alison was .
so you &apos;re one of alison &apos;s friends ?
you want the spot ? !
move a box !
well , then you know .
i &apos;m sorry--know what ?
alison got her kicked out .
at least , that &apos;s what cece claimed .
uh , she could &apos;ve been lying .
true , but having met alison ,
i could see that chick shoving someone down the stairs .
what ?
you were at that frat party .
w @-@ which one are you ?
in alison &apos;s crew ?
cece always said there were four other she @-@ devils .
&quot; she @-@ devils &quot; ?
well i @-@ i hardly even knew cece , and that ...
party was like three years ago .
i barely even remember anything .
well , it stayed pretty fresh in cece &apos;s mind .
she assumed you were all in on it .
and she hated you for it .
hello ?
mrs. dilaurentis ?
hello ?
em ?
mrs. dilaurentis ?
emily ?
dr. palmer ?
why , yes .
hello . um , this is spencer .
hi .
it &apos;s a pleasure .
and i don &apos;t know if you remember me--
i &apos;m marion cavanaugh &apos;s son .
that &apos;s right .
i @-@ i came to visit you not that long ago ,
and we talked about my mother .
i was , uh , hoping that we could talk about her some more .
i &apos;d be happy to talk with you about her .
can you take a look at this ?
that &apos;s a good one .
oh , unfortunately , um ...
i don &apos;t play .
hello , mrs. hastings .
how did you get in here ?
isn &apos;t there someone at the front desk ?
yes , there is .
oh , i guess you must &apos;ve made friends with the nurses
when your daughter was here .
i wanted to have a little chat with you ,
off the record .
may i ?
以斯拉
hey , aria .
i &apos;m , uh ... up in five .
awesome ! i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll be right there .
i just-- i need to take this .
why are you throwing yourself on the sword ?
i get the feeling that you make a lot of people nervous .
am i right ?
well you know what ? so do i.
i can be pretty scary , myself .
and if i find out that you &apos;re going to use
this stunt against my daughter and her friends ,
you &apos;ll find out just how scary .
the only person who messed with your daughter
and her friends was wilden .
and he &apos;s dead now .
okay . have it your way , mona .
but if you continue to screw with my family
or this case ,
i have ways to see to it that you rot in a cell
until your hair turns gray .
you understand me ?
do you remember my mother talking about music ?
i would be happy to talk with you about music .
you know , i adore opera in particular .
uh , sir , i &apos;m not talking about--
oh , marion .
that &apos;s lovely .
is toby coming today ?
no .
no , dr. palmer , he &apos;s not .
well i @-@ i @-@ i think it would mean a lot to him
to hear you play .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s heard me before .
yes , but not since you &apos;ve been here .
i think it would give him a great deal of comfort
to know that you &apos;re enjoying your music once again .
don &apos;t you think he need to see that ?
um , dr. palmer ,
could you tell me again about the blonde girl ?
the one that i should steer clear of ?
what blonde ?
y @-@ you talked to me about her . you said that she was dangerous .
yes .
that &apos;s right .
oh , looks like our time is up .
i will see you next session .
w @-@ was it cece drake ?
dr. palmer , was her name cece drake ?
can you please show mrs. dilaurentis to my office ?
he said , &quot; dilaurentis . &quot;
i &apos;m positive .
how can you be positive ?
you said it was toby that was there , not you .
no--it was .
okay--what was toby doing in an old folks &apos; home ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , okay .
it had something to do with nigel &apos;s phone .
you guys are focusing on the wrong details , okay ?
she was there . ali &apos;s mom was at radley at some point .
he has dementia .
the name &quot; dilaurentis &quot; has been everywhere .
maybe he just got it stuck in his head .
well , i think it &apos;s worth it to find out .
so what ?
you &apos;re just gonna ask her ?
yeah , why not ?
um , because she &apos;s going through a divorce ,
and she &apos;s a little fragile .
i can &apos;t talk about this anymore .
i &apos;m late for work .
emily , is that you ?
uh , actually , emily left for work .
oh , and i was hoping you girls would stay for dinner .
you could even sleep over if you like .
i still have the trundle bed upstairs .
i should ... probably get home .
you know , it &apos;s chilly in here right now ,
but the furnace guy is on his way .
no , it &apos;s-- um , another time .
mrs. dilaurentis ,
do you happen to know a dr. palmer ?
the name rings a bell .
what kind of doctor is he ?
a psychiatrist
from radley .
this is your doctor ?
uh , no , no .
uh , he &apos;s retired .
i was just wondering--
i was wondering if he was yours .
why would you wonder that , dear ?
because he mentioned you .
well , if it &apos;s the guy i &apos;m thinking of ,
i only met him the one time .
but he wasn &apos;t my psychiatrist .
was he ali &apos;s ?
no , he wasn &apos;t .
where are you ?
i &apos;m in here .
aren &apos;t you impressed ? i guess all your nagging finally paid off .
oh , my god !
you almost took off my frickin &apos; fingers !
you think that &apos;s funny ? the stunt you pulled ?
that some sort of sick joke to you ?
you seriously almost took off my limbs .
is that what the two of you do
when you &apos;re not braiding each other &apos;s hair ?
figure out ways to scare the hell out of me ?
why are you having a full @-@ on hemorrhage ?
don &apos;t you speak to me that way .
i don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re talking about !
i get a phone call this afternoon--
&quot; we have your daughter here , &quot; they tell me .
&quot; we think she may be a danger to herself .
she wants to stay here . &quot;
so i run about three stop signs .
i &apos;m trying to get your father on the phone .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m terrified that you &apos;ve hurt yourself .
then i get there-- she &apos;s dressed head @-@ to @-@ toe in your clothing ,
but it &apos;s not my daughter sitting in radley .
it &apos;s cece drake .
i can &apos;t believe that crazy bitch actually did it .
go to your room .
go to your room ,
because i can &apos;t be held accountable for what happens .
i didn &apos;t even know that she was actually gonna do it .
well , you enjoy it ,
because it &apos;s the last game that the two of you
are going to play together .
even the doctor i spoke to agreed that this friendship is toxic .
so are a lot of things .
that girl is no longer welcome in this house .
had they ever done anything like that before ?
no .
but even from the beginning ,
something about their relationship was wrong ,
obsessive .
what ? like ...
wearing each other &apos;s makeup ?
clothes ?
more like wearing each other &apos;s personalities .
that &apos;s pretty messed @-@ up .
yeah , but it makes sense .
remember , that guy hector said
that ali wanted masks of her face made
so that her friends would look more like her ?
i thought that was a dig at us .
so did i , but apparently she was talking about cece .
hi .
hi .
i wasn &apos;t sure if you &apos;d be home for dinner .
oh , no , i thought we could just order a pizza .
okay , sure .
honey , have you spoken to your mom lately ?
uh , not since earlier . why ?
i-- you should probably head home .
mrs. hastings , what &apos;s going on ?
someone made an anonymous complaint to the court .
they &apos;re accusing me of obstruction of justice .
what ? !
they &apos;re alleging that i bullied mona into ...
giving her confession .
that &apos;s crazy .
i know . and the charges won &apos;t hold water for long ,
but unfortunately , the damage is done .
what damage ?
in order not to hurt your mother &apos;s case ,
i have to recuse myself .
what does that mean ?
it means ...
right now , your mother doesn &apos;t have a lawyer .
i didn &apos;t know it was gonna go so ...
late .
it &apos;s okay .
and just so you know ,
my plan wasn &apos;t to brown @-@ bag it on a stoop .
my plan was to take you somewhere nice .
hey , it &apos;s fine .
fine .
like steak or--or something . it--
i ... don &apos;t eat meat .
at all .
well , i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t do that .
what , that sauce a little too spicy for you , sport ?
excuse me ?
i love spicy food .
no , it &apos;s just , uh ,
this scratch doesn &apos;t .
gimme that . give it to me .
lemme see .
sorry , it &apos;s just ...
so tiny i can &apos;t really see it in this light .
all right , all right .
no kidding , though-- that guy got me right in the jaw .
my mouth hurts just movin &apos; it .
how is a total badass like you ,
who won his match tonight , acting like such a baby ?
so ...
think i &apos;m a badass ?
no , not at all . i think you &apos;re a faker .
you &apos;re grinning from ear to ear right now .
doesn &apos;t seem to be hurting at all .
i can &apos;t help it .
you &apos;re here with me on a stoop ...
eating a vegetarian burrito .
i can &apos;t help but smile right now .
does this hurt ?
try again .
how about this ?
hi , mrs. dilaurentis .
hi . how was work ?
fine . fine .
what are you knitting ?
what was going to be a scarf for my husband ,
but now i guess it &apos;ll be a tight sweater for me .
by the way , you can call me jessica .
the circuit breaker was blown .
ah , so ,
i replaced it ,
and it should start to warm up in here
in about 20 minutes .
great . thank you so much .
yeah , um ,
i don &apos;t exactly know how to say this ,
but ... looks like you have a bigger problem .
you said so yourself-- this isn &apos;t true .
won &apos;t this all just blow over ?
the prosecution still might try to use it in the trial .
and we just can &apos;t risk that .
oh , i need to take this .
i have to go home . i have to go see my mom .
okay , i &apos;ll join you .
hanna , just calm down . everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
&apos;kay--no it &apos;s not !
okay , an anonymous tip ? who do you think called that in ? !
hey , take a breath .
no , i have to go home .
i know . it &apos;s very upsetting .
well a real lapse in judgment .
well , i was beginning to suspect
the confession was coerced ,
but yeah , i was shocked when i learned
it was my former mother @-@ in @-@ law .
almost mother @-@ in @-@ law .
guess i dodged a bullet there .
well , just goes to show--
you can &apos;t trust anyone .
over there .
he &apos;s right .
it definitely looks like somebody used this
as their temporary home .
oh , should we ...
maybe call the police ?
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re long gone .
my guess is they moved out
before jason moved back in .
unfortunately , they left us quite a mess .
maybe i can get the gardener to clear that out .
hey , i &apos;m gonna heat up some lasagna .
you must be starving .
