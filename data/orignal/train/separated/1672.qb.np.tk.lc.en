having a little trouble catching your breath there ?
no , no , i &apos;m good .
if my p.e. teachers had told me this is what i was training for ,
i would have tried a lot harder .
&quot; do or do not . there is no try . &quot;
did you just quote star wars ?
i believe i quoted empire strikes back .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote yoda .
i love you , penny .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i just wanted to put that out there .
oh , yeah , no , i @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m glad .
good .
glad is good .
yeah .
no , no ...
so , it &apos;s getting pretty late .
we should probably go to sleep .
yeah .
okay .
yeah , probably .
okay , good night , sweetie .
good night .
hey , leonard , where do you come down on giant ants ?
sheldon says impossible .
howard and i say not only possible ,
but as a mode of transportation , way cooler than a batmobile .
you are ignoring the square @-@ cube law .
the giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its own exoskeleton .
and for the record ,
the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is :
jet pack , hoverboard , transporter , batmobile ,
and then giant ant .
seriously ?
you have nothing better to do
than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants ?
what &apos;s with him ?
perhaps he &apos;s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle .
are you saying he &apos;s man @-@ strating ?
not literally .
but as far back as the 17th century ,
scientists observed a 33 @-@ day fluctuation
in men &apos;s hormone levels .
interesting .
that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month .
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
okay , forget giant ants .
how about giant rabbits ?
big or small , i don &apos;t like rabbits .
they always look like they &apos;re about to say something ,
but they never do .
rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size .
and on a side note , they are one of the few mammals
whose scrotum is in front of the penis .
maybe that &apos;s what they want to talk about .
leonard , where do you stand on giant rabbits
and scrotal position ?
i honestly don &apos;t care .
really ?
because every time we &apos;ve talked about unusual animal genitals ,
you &apos;ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions .
what do you want from me ?
i just don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass .
would that be a giant rat &apos;s ass ?
for the record , giant rats are possible .
can we please talk about something else ?
maybe something vaguely related
to life as we know it on this planet ?
okay , how about this for a topic :
why is leonard being a giant douche ?
assuming giant douches are possible .
of course they are .
leonard &apos;s being one .
maybe he &apos;s having a lover &apos;s spat with penny .
no , there was no spat .
oh , but something happened .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
but i sense you &apos;re going to and i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
excuse me .
what &apos;d you do , romeo ?
you pour maple syrup all over your body
and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack ?
did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties
and jump around , but it wound up just creeping her out ?
what ? no .
i &apos;m just asking , dude .
it happens .
you guys still on for bowling tonight ?
oh , yes .
in fact , i &apos;ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion .
you bowl like your mama .
unless , of course , she bowls well .
in which case , you bowl nothing like her .
oh . ouch .
that is what is referred to as a burn on you .
did you ask her to start waxing ?
no .
did you start waxing ?
no .
while making love ,
did you accidentally spank your own ass
and cry out , &quot; mommy &quot; ?
i &apos;m walking away from you now .
that wasn &apos;t a no .
yeah , i think we &apos;re getting close .
did you take a benadryl
and fall asleep while pleasuring her ?
because you can die that way .
oh , that would be a good way to go .
hi .
oh , hey .
good , penny .
reminder : bowling tonight at 7 : 00 .
oh , right , bowling .
you don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
i mean , let &apos;s face it , you guys would get creamed without me .
we would indeed .
in this particular case ,
your lack of femininity works to our advantage .
it &apos;s always nice chatting with you , sheldon .
sarcasm ?
thinly veiled contempt .
remember : 7 : 00 .
got it .
pacific daylight time !
bite me !
please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes .
i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes .
these are my own bowling shoes .
then what &apos;s with the disinfectant ?
i know where my feet have been .
hey , penny !
and you guys .
albino bob couldn &apos;t make it ,
so i brought a substitute .
i believe some of you know
wil wheaton .
hi , sheldon . how &apos;s it going ?
well , well , well .
if it isn &apos;t wil wheaton ,
the green goblin to my spider @-@ man .
the pope paul v to my galileo ,
the internet explorer to my firefox .
you &apos;re not still carrying a grudge
because i beat you at that card tournament , are you ?
i &apos;m the proud owner
of wilwheatonstinks.com , .net , and .org.
what does that tell you ?
it tells me that i am living rent @-@ free right here .
you ready to bowl ?
oh , i &apos;m ready .
i don &apos;t know if stuart told you
what you &apos;re up against tonight ,
but before you stands the co @-@ captain of the
east texas christian youth holy roller bowling league
championship team .
seven- to 12 @-@ year @-@ old division .
also , penny &apos;s pretty good .
great . then it &apos;s on .
oh , foolish wil wheaton , it was never off .
yes !
a common spare .
the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant .
before you jump on twitter
to tout your modest accomplishment ,
watch how it &apos;s really done .
i am the ball .
my thoughts are its thoughts .
its holes are my holes .
yes .
tweet that , tweety bird .
hey , i just wanted to tell you
i &apos;m a big fan .
oh , thanks .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re probably sick of star trek questions ,
but whoopi goldberg-- you ever hit that ?
ah , beer .
the magic elixir that can turn this poor , shy indian boy
into the life of the party .
oh , yeah .
chili cheese fry ?
yes . i love chili cheese fries .
really ? you love them ?
yeah , why ?
no reason . i &apos;m just glad to hear
you &apos;re comfortable saying you love something .
do you really want to get into this right now ?
get into what ?
why wouldn &apos;t you love the chili cheese fries ?
they &apos;ve been in your life a long time .
they make you happy .
they deserve to know .
look , you just caught me by surprise last night .
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
okay , well , now you &apos;ve had some time to think about it .
so , what do you want to say ?
i &apos;m not sure .
how can you not be sure ?
okay , this isn &apos;t the place to have this conversation .
no , the place to have the conversation was in bed
after i said , &quot; i love you &quot;
and you said , &quot; thank you . good night . &quot;
don &apos;t push it , leonard .
i am not pushing anything .
you are .
you don &apos;t get to decide when i &apos;m ready to say &quot; i love you ! &quot;
ah , the premature &quot; i love you . &quot;
i guessed &quot; premature . &quot; does that count ?
penny .
penny .
penny .
what ?
this is for you .
ice cream ?
i &apos;ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises .
by studying the comic strip cathy .
when she &apos;s upset , she says , &quot; ack ! &quot; and eats ice cream .
ack !
if you were a cat , i would have brought you a lasagna .
did leonard send you over here ?
no , we haven &apos;t spoken
since your abrupt departure last night
caused us to forfeit to stuart
and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry about that .
i &apos;m not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep .
again , i &apos;m sorry .
and let me tell you , sleep did not
come easily with leonard in the next room
singing along with alanis morrisette .
you &apos;re kidding .
no . clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream .
all right , sheldon , what part of this
is supposed to make me feel better ?
the part where i tell you
i &apos;ve engineered a rematch
with stuart &apos;s team for tonight .
oh , honey , i don &apos;t know .
things are a little weird with leonard right now .
you want me to remove him from the team ?
i &apos;m the captain . i can do that .
no , no , that &apos;s okay .
just let me talk to him , and i &apos;ll get back to you .
when are you going to talk to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s in the laundry room now . now would be a good time .
you &apos;re n gonna leave me alone until i do it , are you ?
oh , i think we both know the answer to that question .
i think we should talk now .
wha ... ? no , it &apos;s okay .
we don &apos;t have to talk &apos; cause there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
everything &apos;s good .
really ?
so , you didn &apos;t get all snarky
&apos;cause i said something nice to a bowl of chili fries ?
all right , maybe i overreacted .
so we &apos;re in two different places emotionally . so what ?
and maybe i &apos;m a little ahead of you . that &apos;s fine .
in fact , it makes sense , &apos; cause let &apos;s face it ,
i &apos;ve been in this relationship two years longer than you .
look , leonard , you have to know how much i care about you .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve said the &quot; l &quot; word
too soon before , and it didn &apos;t work out very well .
really ?
i wouldn &apos;t know what that &apos;s like .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know what i &apos;m talking about , though .
yeah , i do .
so , we &apos;re good ?
yes , that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
we are good . we are great .
all right ! fence mended , problem swept under the rug .
time to bowl !
yes , i was eavesdropping .
there &apos;s a lot at stake here .
attention , all bowlers :
i &apos;ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch .
&quot; the wesley crushers &quot; ?
no , not the wesley crushers .
the wesley crushers .
i don &apos;t get it .
wesley crusher was
wil wheaton &apos;s character on star trek .
still don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s a blindingly clever play on words .
by appropriating his character &apos;s name and adding the s ,
we imply that we we &apos;ll be the crushers of wesley .
okay , i &apos;m sorry , honey ,
but the wesley crushers sounds like a bunch of people
who like wesley crusher .
no ! again , it &apos;s not the wesley crushers .
it &apos;s the wesley crushers .
no , if you want it to mean you &apos;re crushing wesley ,
it &apos;d be the wesley crushers .
do you people even hear yourselves ?
it &apos;s not the wesley crushers .
it &apos;s not the wesley crushers .
it &apos;s the wesley crushers .
hey , look .
they named their team after me .
no , it &apos;s not the ...
never mind .
so , we &apos;re all clear on the bet and the stakes ?
oh , yes . the losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor .
fyi : i plan on having you publish a scientific paper
expounding the discredited velikovsky hypothesis .
ouch again .
hey , sheldon ,
i just wanted you to know
that i &apos;m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you .
oh , yes ?
well , before i respond , let me a you a question .
is your mother a good or poor bowler ?
after you .
no , after you ...
as we are currently crushing you , wesley .
it &apos;s customary for the player on the right @-@ hand lane to bowl first .
all right .
it &apos;s a custom , not a rule .
i so loathe you .
that &apos;s right , sheldon .
embrace the dark side .
that &apos;s not even from your franchise !
i , um , i want you to know that
even though we &apos;re on opposite sides ,
i , i bear you no ill will .
thank you , stuart . it &apos;s nice to know .
people from opposite sides
often have good relationships .
you know , romeo and juliet ...
tony and maria from west side story ,
what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name and the big blue chick in avatar .
i &apos;m gonna bowl now .
be the ball , howard .
leave me alone , sheldon .
you weren &apos;t the ball .
hey , thanks .
this is fun , huh ?
yeah .
it &apos;s good that we got out and did something physical .
gets us out of our heads .
you get in your head ,
you start to overthink , overanalyze , obsess , you worry .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing tonight .
tonight we &apos;re just throwing a ball at some pins .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
and someday-- we don &apos;t know when--
maybe you &apos;ll love me back .
ooh , i &apos;m up .
shel @-@ don ! shel @-@ don ! shel @-@ don ! shel @-@ don !
excuse me .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re chanting for as i am currently the ball .
the ball ! the ball !
the ball ! the ball ! the ball ! the ball !
thank you , jesus !
as my mother would say .
i &apos;m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend .
oh , yeah , me , too .
it &apos;s always tough when the &quot; l &quot; bomb gets dropped
and you &apos;re not ready for it .
tell me about it .
i dated this one girl ,
and i told her that i loved her ,
and she said she wasn &apos;t sure .
and she strung me along for almost two years .
it was brutal .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
i wish she had just broken up with me right there ,
and put me out of my misery .
really ?
yeah , would have been kinder .
wil , you &apos;re up .
oh , that &apos;s me .
did you let wil wheaton get in your head ?
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s evil . he plays evil mind games .
did he tell you his grandmother died ?
no !
well , if he does , don &apos;t believe it .
he &apos;s not above playing the dead meemaw card .
yes !
enjoy the accolades now , wil wheaton ,
but like your time on star trek : next generation ,
your smug self @-@ satisfaction will be short @-@ lived .
penny , you &apos;re up .
all right , remember , his meemaw &apos;s alive
and be the ball .
yeah , i got it .
we really need a strike here .
i know .
so just take your time and concentrate .
leonard , stop pressuring me .
i &apos;m not pressuring you .
yeah , you are ! just back off !
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll shut up .
i didn &apos;t mean &quot; shut up . &quot;
fine . just tell me what to do , and i &apos;ll do it .
no ...
this isn &apos;t fair to you , leonard . i &apos;m sorry .
wait ! where are you going ?
penny , come back !
i &apos;ll get you ice cream !
no , let her go .
are you insane ?
if she leaves , it &apos;s over !
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s already over .
tough luck , sheldon .
you did this , didn &apos;t you ?
do you think i would really break up a couple
just to win a bowling match ?
no , i suppose not .
good . keep thinking that .
mm @-@ hmm , mm @-@ hmm , yeah , i &apos;m telling you ,
the match.com chicks are much looser than on eharmony .
you know , i @-@ i gotta call you back .
i won a bet , and it &apos;s time to collect .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i feel empowered .
