i want to make you a lot of money , louise . trust me .
your mother came to see me last night .
what did she want ?
a loan .
now she owes me .
did you get a look at his face ?
i could barely make out anything
before he jumped off the balcony .
it is true that david clarke is alive .
em .
are you ready to make an i.d. ?
no .
conrad grayson faked my death ,
and then he locked me away .
we ask for privacy so that david can be with his family .
she got to him first .
you were right .
they &apos;re not gonna leave me alone .
which is why i didn &apos;t want you to come here .
i needed to see it for myself .
i &apos;m not fighting with you , david .
i &apos;m simply concerned for you .
still edgy after the fbi debriefings .
it wasn &apos;t easy going over the past 10 years .
i &apos;m so sorry you had to endure that .
i &apos;m grateful that you --
that you were in d.c. with me this week ...
... and for confirming what i said .
they &apos;re on the move .
no one will ever know what happened to conrad .
i promise , david .
can you imagine the headlines if they did ?
and we thought we &apos;d create a scandal running away together .
remember ?
seems like a lifetime ago .
yes , it does .
i used to think about that day on the beach .
it helped keep me sane when i was ... about to break .
i used to imagine our life if we had gotten away .
this time , we will .
i promise .
hey . emily .
those may be fists of fury ,
but they &apos;re still made of flesh and bone .
go easy .
five days , i &apos;ve been forced to watch my father on tv
while victoria hasn &apos;t left his side .
yeah , and it &apos;s not your fault that she got to him first .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
i know how fragile a person &apos;s mind is
after enduring that kind of torture .
it &apos;s exactly the kind of leverage victoria needs to manipulate him .
and ... they just got back from d.c.
she took him to amanda &apos;s grave ?
ems ...
look at what she &apos;s doing , nolan !
we have to get him away from her .
yeah , i know , and it pisses me off , too .
he was like a father to me .
he is my father .
and he clearly doesn &apos;t know that ,
which means she hasn &apos;t told him .
i mean , we don &apos;t know what angle victoria is playing yet .
i &apos;ll take the risk .
the last time you were in a room with your father ,
he tried to kill you .
he wasn &apos;t coming for me , nolan .
he was probably looking for conrad .
probably .
but it still proves that he is not the man that he once was .
emily , what if it &apos;s worse than we think ?
what if conrad did break him ?
jack , any word from david ?
have you talked to your father @-@ in @-@ law yet ?
guys , stay on the sidewalk . i got a kid inside .
when is david gonna meet his grandson ?
are you afraid he &apos;s upset with you
for not protecting amanda ?
do you think he blames you for the death of his daughter ?
get the hell off my property now !
now ! both of you !
victoria , it &apos;s margaux again .
i understand you do not wish to speak with the media ,
but we are family , so please ... trust me .
call me back .
you won &apos;t hear from her .
she &apos;s gonna keep working this three @-@ ring circus
like p.t. barnum in stilettos .
while i watch from the stands along with everyone else ...
despite the fact that she owes me
and , not to mention , our connection .
yeah , a connection no one knows about .
take my advice ... keep it that way .
why ?
what happened with david was conrad &apos;s crime , not yours .
to the public , we graysons are all the same .
why do you think i haven &apos;t been able
to land a client , other than louise ellis ?
i can help you , daniel .
tell your side , change people &apos;s opinions .
no , no , no . no press .
i have to do this my way .
listen , when i was with emily ,
we lived in the headlines , and that was a mistake .
the less people know about you ,
the more control you have over your own life .
is that why you &apos;re so secretive about this louise girl ?
yeah . i can &apos;t afford to blow this .
she &apos;s that valuable ?
i &apos;m still counting the zeroes in her portfolio .
and by some miracle ,
she chose me to handle her account .
and i just got to prove that she didn &apos;t make a mistake .
then you know what you must do ...
keep her happy .
david !
someone just tried to run over david clarke .
david !
do they know who did this ?
no . no .
they found the car three blocks away .
it was stolen . it &apos;s a dead end .
they &apos;ve offered me police protection
until they catch the guy .
david , we must get you to safety .
now , i &apos;ve already talked to a friend of mine
who has an estate in maryland ,
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
and they &apos;re willing
to allow us to use it , david .
why would you stay here ? it &apos;s not safe .
all these stories i hear about amanda --
nothing really makes sense .
i &apos;d gone to her grave today hoping for some closure ,
and it just raised more questions .
i fear you won &apos;t like the answers .
i don &apos;t care .
i am gonna find out what really happened to my girl .
victoria was behind this . i &apos;m sure of it .
she &apos;s terrified that my father will learn the truth about her ,
so she put a police line between us .
well , it definitely sounds like her shade of bitch .
which is why you have to be extra @-@ careful ,
because now the hotel is crawling with cops and press .
you think that &apos;s gonna stop me ?
you know what ?
maybe if aiden were here , he could make you see it .
but he &apos;s not , so you have to listen to me .
victoria &apos;s gunning for you ,
and she &apos;s thought all of this through
with the same precision you usually do .
so before you make a mistake , slow down .
i can &apos;t , okay ?
don &apos;t you understand , nolan ?
i never went to see him in prison .
all of these years , he believed that his daughter hated him ,
and i &apos;ve lived with that guilt every single day .
now i have the chance to make it right ,
to let him know that his daughter still loves him ,
so please , stop fighting me .
of course .
of course , kiddo .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
vicky &apos;s done a hell of a job clarke @-@ blocking us .
only family can get through , and ... you don &apos;t qualify .
at least , not yet .
porter . go home .
but i &apos;m on the roster .
this is about david clarke , isn &apos;t it ?
tough to do your job when reporters are tailing you .
i need you to sit this one out ... just till it blows over .
yeah . sure , chief .
i saw you got ambushed this morning .
you all right ?
i &apos;m dying to get out there today .
can &apos;t stand sitting around , feeling useless .
imagine all this has got to bring up
some pretty heavy stuff for you , yeah ?
it &apos;s always there in the back of my mind ,
but now every jerk with a microphone &apos;s asking me about it .
&quot; what happened to your brother , to amanda ? &quot;
how did you make it through all that ?
i almost didn &apos;t .
for a while , i thought that god had it out for me .
turns out , it wasn &apos;t god at all ...
just a man who thought he was ,
not giving a damn about who he hurt or who died .
son of a bitch got what he deserved .
well , the world seems to agree with you , but still ...
i mean , a case that high @-@ profile just gathering dust ?
it &apos;s a little weird , don &apos;t you think ?
well , maybe it &apos;s &apos; cause people can see it for what it is ...
justice .
ah ! danny ! you made it !
is this your first business meeting in a dress shop ?
pretty ... pretty sure it is , yeah .
although , next time ,
you might want to choose someplace more private .
my family is still the top story .
they don &apos;t bother me .
i &apos;m from the south , dear .
if they are not gossiping about you ,
you might as well be dead .
maybe i like to maintain a little mystery about myself .
well , i &apos;m still trying to figure you out ,
so mission accomplished .
which part are you trying to f @-@ figure out , exactly ?
well , you and your mama , for starters .
why the feud ?
oh , there &apos;s no mystery .
she &apos;s a control freak .
i got tired of her
injecting herself into every aspect of my life .
hmm . even your love life ?
especially that .
you want my mom &apos;s attention , date me .
noted .
too much ?
or &quot; hot damn &quot; ?
definitely &quot; hot damn . &quot;
so , tell me , danny ,
am i wasting all my top @-@ notch flirting on you ?
is there a ... prim new york girl waiting at home ?
no .
no , there &apos;s not .
of course you &apos;d be here .
i need your help .
why would i ever help you ?
our problems are not the issue right now . our father is .
please ... i need to see him alone .
why don &apos;t you just scale the building , knock down the door ?
i doubt a little police barricade can stop you .
i would do that , but that &apos;s not exactly
how i want to reunite with our father .
oh i get it , so you want me
to pave the way
for your triumphant return .
i think i &apos;ll pass .
are you sure you want to side with your mother on this ?
who do you think was behind the attack today ?
no . she loves david . she would never hurt him .
charlotte .
you and i both know that your mother would do
whatever it takes to get what she wants ,
including putting our father &apos;s life at risk .
she is manipulating him .
god , charlotte ,
she took him to what was supposed to be my grave .
do you know how painful that must have been for him ?
we have to stop her .
please . i just want to tell him the truth .
mother , you need to tell me the truth .
were you behind the attack on david ?
how could you think i would do such a thing ?
i do not threaten the people i love
to get what i want .
you are so blind ,
you can &apos;t even see you &apos;re using him .
you took him to that grave ? ! what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
your father demanded to go there against my wishes .
do you think i enjoy watching him suffer ?
then why not just tell him the truth ?
that &apos;s all emily wants to do .
emily . well .
she is manipulating you , charlotte .
that is what she does ... she lies .
and when that doesn &apos;t work ,
she resorts to violence and fear .
if she &apos;d only told me the truth when she first arrived ,
the girl in that grave would be alive today ,
and so would declan .
all right , mr. clarke . i &apos;ll be right outside .
charlotte .
oh . dad .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
charlotte , what is it ?
if there &apos;s , uh , something you need to tell me , you can .
actually , dad , there &apos;s someone you need to meet .
i became a cop to get control of my life .
and now i can feel it all slipping away again ,
and i hate that it &apos;s ...
man , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m going on like this .
you &apos;re not the only mcmurphy in this cuckoo &apos;s nest .
i mean , david was the father that i always wanted .
when i thought he was killed , i fell apart .
but now he &apos;s back , and there is a part of me
that just wants to go to him .
well , every part of me
wants to stay as far away from him as possible .
&apos;cause of carl ?
david thinks that my son is his grandchild .
what would i even say to him ?
i can &apos;t imagine lying about something like that .
personally , i &apos;m glad the truth &apos;s finally coming out .
i wish i felt the same .
what do you mean ?
emily has been so focused on getting to david
that she &apos;s not thinking through all the variables .
well , can you blame her ? it &apos;s her father .
jack , i know .
but ... i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s rushing
to meet a man that doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
and i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s gonna do to her .
what are you doing ?
are you selling access to david clarke ?
maybe sneak in a camera , get some stolen footage ?
um , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t
get out of here .
i expect better from you .
what ? you truly believe others out there are not doing the same ?
and that makes it right ?
it makes it reality .
you know , some of us have a job to do .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , but why are you ?
i am fightin for amanda clarke .
she wanted her father &apos;s name cleared
and her enemies brought to justice ,
but what she didn &apos;t want
was for him to be used by people like you .
you should learn to govern your emotions , emily .
this is such an unflattering color on you .
上来
people think the secret &apos;s in the copper mug .
it &apos;s actually the extra vodka .
to ... getting what you want .
i &apos;ll drink to that , neighbor .
mm . temporary neighbor .
i &apos;m having my yacht brought from hilton head .
a hotel &apos;s not an appropriate place to call home .
you calling me inappropriate ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
but it does reveal quite a bit about you .
i mean , look around , danny .
no personal items .
nothing to remind you of your family
or where you come from .
you are a man in search of an identity .
and you clearly haven &apos;t settled on one yet .
you &apos;re unlike anyone i &apos;ve ever met .
well , multiple rounds of electroshock therapy
will do that to a girl .
i just haven &apos;t figured you out yet , either .
now , which part are you trying to figure out , exactly ?
is something the matter ?
because ... unless i &apos;m sorely mistaken ,
you &apos;re just as attracted to me as i am to you .
so , tell me , daniel grayson ...
what do you want ?
jack .
i thought it was time
david was finally reunited with his son @-@ in @-@ law .
hello , jack .
uh , come in .
charlotte said you would be joining me .
do come in . we have so much to discuss .
where the hell is my father ?
and what exactly is your plan once you do find him , emily ?
you know damn well ,
which is why you &apos;re so desperate to turn him against me .
i will not destroy the memory of his child .
you may have that honor , if you truly are that cruel .
you want to talk &quot; cruel , &quot; victoria ?
how about ripping a child away from her father
or bribing a doctor
into poisoning every good memory she ever had of him ?
that is the truth that you &apos;re running from .
now tell me where my father is .
or you &apos;ll what ?
come after my children again ?
or am i to be the next victim in your growing body count ?
oh , that , i could live with .
but could your father ?
have you ever considered what will happen
when you tell him about all your lies
or the death you caused in his name , hmm ?
i wonder what he &apos;ll feel .
guilt ?
shame ?
your plan was perfect , emily , save for one detail ...
your father is alive .
and now you must live with the repercussions of what you &apos;ve done .
and so will you .
i &apos;ll make sure of it .
then tell him .
or stay hidden in this pathetic identity .
either way , it will be tremendous fun to watch .
you can show yourself out .
you know what i see ?
is just a frightened woman
about to lose the last person
she could ever trick into loving her
to his daughter .
david , it &apos;s ... really great to see you again ,
but i &apos;m afraid we were just on our way out .
carl has a checkup .
you can &apos;t . david has to meet his grandson .
of course .
hey there , big man .
i &apos;m your grandpa .
it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever said that .
he has her eyes , don &apos;t you think ?
it &apos;s hard for me to remember .
i &apos;ll get the wedding album .
there &apos;s some great closeup shots of amanda . you &apos;ll see it .
it &apos;s a nice home you &apos;ve made for yourself here , jack .
i just wish amanda could have seen this place .
she always wanted a house like this .
where did you two live ?
down on the waterfront .
remember the stowaway ?
the @-@ the bar ?
they lived above it .
it was nicer than it sounds , small , but cozy .
here &apos;s amanda .
oh , yeah .
he does have her eyes .
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
i really need to get carl to this doctor &apos;s apartment .
yeah , of course . jack , thank you so much .
you know , it &apos;s clear to me
that you &apos;ve grown up to be an honorable man .
yeah , jack &apos;s one of the good guys .
i could get in a lot of trouble
if someone finds out i gave you this .
you don &apos;t have clearance , ben . it &apos;s a federal case .
yeah , one they aren &apos;t any closer to solving , either .
figure , why not take a shot at it myself ?
and make detective , right ? that mean you got a lead ?
i got a suspect with motive .
david .
i want to talk to you .
of course .
come in . come in .
no police ?
no , they &apos;re waiting outside . i wanted some privacy .
right .
well , i @-@ i knew you &apos;d have questions about amanda .
did you give her the money or the box that i made her ?
did she ever get the journals ?
i gave her everything the day she got out ,
everything that you asked .
then why was she living above a bar ?
because ...
i know .
you &apos;re hearing a lot of crazy things about amanda right now--
some of them from people you may even think you trust .
i hope you won &apos;t take their word as fact .
i hope that you will trust
what you know in your heart to be true .
but that &apos;s the problem , nolan .
see , the more i hear ,
the harder it is for me to remember my little girl .
she &apos;s slipping away from me .
and that scares the hell out of me .
figured you &apos;d be here .
guess it was a bad day all around .
i went to see my father ,
and victoria was waiting for me instead .
i &apos;m not thinking this through properly .
nolan was right . he warned me not to go .
i doubt there &apos;s a person alive who could have stopped you .
well , you &apos;re probably right .
jack , do you think my father &apos;s gonna hate me
for everything i &apos;ve done ?
stop it .
that &apos;s just victoria getting inside your head .
no , it &apos;s not .
you need to have faith in him , emily .
trust me , a father never stops loving their child .
people died in his name .
my father never would have wanted that .
yes , but they started it .
you did what you had to do to stop them .
no one knows that better than me .
because you were there .
but how am i gonna get him to understand
if i can &apos;t even get to him ?
victoria can twist the truth , all of it .
no . she can &apos;t .
i know , cause i was just with david .
what ?
yes .
he &apos;s afraid ,
mainly of losing touch
with the memory of you , emily .
and the good news is ,
he hasn &apos;t given up on his daughter .
there is still a chance that you can connect with him .
you need to get david away from her .
i need to bring my father
back to a time that victoria can &apos;t touch ,
when it was just the two of us in this house .
my father needs amanda clarke .
if you &apos;ve come here to do battle ,
i must warn you , i have an 11 : 30,
so please be concise .
i am not here to argue .
in fact , i came to apologize for yesterday .
i don &apos;t always think clearly when it comes to amanda .
then let me assure you ,
i have no interest in exploiting her father .
i know .
you &apos;re a good person , margaux .
that became clear to me when you cut ties with daniel .
so , what brings you by , emily ?
i want to do something for david ,
something that i believe will aid in his recovery
and might also give you
a way around victoria &apos;s media blackout .
forgive me , but how would that work ?
you and victoria seem to have quite--
a strained relationship ?
that &apos;s a nice way of putting it .
well , see , that &apos;s where you come in .
obviously , victoria would never accept a gesture from me ,
so it &apos;s vital that my name be kept out of the story --
that is , if you &apos;re willing to take full credit .
i was wondering when you &apos;d show up .
want a drink ?
what the hell do you think you were pulling yesterday ?
wow . you are not a very good cop .
terrible deductive reasoning .
so this is all just some sick joke
to you and your mother -- is that it ?
no . she had nothing to do with my visit .
what if i &apos;d told david the truth ?
and expose emily ?
not a chance .
you &apos;re a coward , jack -- a joke .
we &apos;re done here .
you know , i came here thinking
you were just some kid pretending to be her mother .
you &apos;re not victoria . you &apos;re worse .
you &apos;re conrad ..
i &apos;m nothing like him .
you &apos;re doing exactly what he did .
you are torturing david . and for what ?
some pathetic power trip over me ?
he &apos;s your father , charlotte .
no wonder you have to hide behind all that crap .
how else could you live with yourself ?
you worked the grayson kidnapping , right ?
yeah . i was there when porter got arrested .
why are you asking ?
well , he &apos;s my partner .
just want to know what kind of man he is .
and you were there for the questioning ?
yeah .
yeah , reyes grilled him for hours .
she was sure he was guilty .
she figured porter planned it all --
you know , grabbed the girl ,
planted the camera on her , took grayson down .
i never bought it .
why not ?
i mean , grayson killed his wife and his brother .
whoever pulled that off wasn &apos;t the owner of some dive bar .
an operation like that takes money .
so you never looked at porter for the murder , huh ?
he was in with reyes and me when grayson got whacked .
best alibi a guy could have .
right .
daniel ? are you here ?
you haven &apos;t been returning any of my calls .
i &apos;m working .
well , i may have something
that can help you even more than louise ellis .
margaux , i don &apos;t ask about your work ,
so stay out of mine .
don &apos;t push me away -- not this time .
you may not see it yet ,
but i know we &apos;re better together than apart .
i would have never been able to take on gideon without you .
and now i have found a way
to put your father &apos;s scandal behind you --
forever .
but you have to trust me .
everou got to do , just do it without me .
daniel , this isn &apos;t charity .
it &apos;s simply good business --
for both of us .
where is the police ?
i sent them away . i don &apos;t want them anymore .
they still haven &apos;t found the driver of that car , david .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
i was a prisoner for 20 years .
i won &apos;t live like one anymore .
david .
you need to trust me when i tell you that you need protection .
not everybody here has your best interests at heart .
y @-@ you &apos;re not the first person
to say something like that to me .
and it &apos;s , making me wonder
who i can trust and who i shouldn &apos;t .
something is not right here .
mr. clarke .
daniel ?
look at you .
daniel , this isn &apos;t a good time right now .
listen , i &apos;m ...
sorry to stop by unannounced .
i just needed to come here today
to personally apologize for what was done to you .
you weren &apos;t responsible .
no , still , what my father did defies words ,
and reparations need to be made .
that &apos;s the deed to your beach house .
consider it my gift to you .
what are you doing ?
a toning for my father &apos;s sins .
david , i &apos;ve already lined up a place for us .
this was my home .
this -- this is what i want .
emily would never sell to you .
now , how did you get the deed to this house ?
she didn &apos;t know i was involved .
i refuse to allow you to use david .
see , i thought you might say that ,
so i took a few precautions .
cat &apos;s out of the bag now .
just smile for the cameras .
don &apos;t want to cause a scene , do you ?
david . hey , this is margaux lemarchal .
she heads up ...
lemarchal media . yes , i @-@ i know who she is .
do you mind explaining the cameras ?
well , daniel thought we could contain the gossip
if someone he trusted covered this story .
let &apos;s just go outside .
no , it won &apos;t take long .
david , are you comfortable with this ?
i am .
just stick to the questions .
then i &apos;m happy for you .
this is your home .
you got your father away from victoria .
although daniel and margaux is a twist i didn &apos;t see coming .
now i know margaux isn &apos;t truly an ally ,
she really is her father &apos;s daughter .
shacking up with the son of conrad , no less .
so , what do we call them ?
maniel ?
dangaux ?
trouble .
that parlor trick you pulled with daniel tonight
disappointed me , margaux .
oh , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
i will not allow you to use david like that again .
well , then , perhaps we should come to an arrangement --
one with less opportunity for surprises .
give me exclusive rights to david &apos;s story .
consider it repayment of your debt .
i can &apos;t speak for david , margaux .
you know better than that .
but i may be able to facilitate such an arrangement
provided you give us final approval on all stories .
i cannot do that .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
as you know , your competitors have approached me .
who knows what one of the more tenacious reporters
might uncover in their own investigation --
maybe even your family &apos;s connection to the scandal .
and lacking any personal relationship with them ,
i may be powerless to stop it .
you would never allow anyone
to tarnish the memory of your pascal .
perhaps you &apos;re right .
do feel free to call my bluff .
victoria .
we have a deal .
oh , no , no . it &apos;s the least that i could do .
i mean , poor guy has really suffered .
well , yeah , i &apos;d love to meet tomorrow .
keith , let me call you back .
saw you on tv with that lemarchal girl .
you two looked cozy .
so i asked around , and the concierge says
she &apos;s been sneaking up here for days .
you lied to me , daniel .
you &apos;re right .
i did lie to you .
and to myself .
you were right about me , louise .
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out who i am .
and for a minute , i thought i could be
the guy i was with you yesterday , but ...
today , i was reminded that i &apos;m part of a team ,
and we &apos;re damn good together .
and what does that mean for me ?
well , you hired me to protect you and your interests ,
so that &apos;s what i plan on doing from now on .
unless you &apos;re not comfortable with me ,
and if that &apos;s the case , then we &apos;ll go our separate ways .
it &apos;s your call .
why would i go with anyone but you ?
fantastic .
listen , we are gonna make a ton of money together , louise .
tomorrow , you and i start over .
we keep things strictly professional .
and trust me -- i &apos;m doing you a favor .
i mean , you really don &apos;t want to be a part of my family .
yes , hello .
please connect me to page six .
i have a story about daniel grayson .
did you think you could pull that file
without my finding out ?
you &apos;re a beat cop , hunter .
you got no business kicking that nest .
yeah , well , someone should , chief .
come on -- conrad grayson gets killed
days after being exposed for masterminding flight 197,
and the case is still open ?
so ... you close it ?
no . my suspect has an alibi .
i get you &apos;re hungry , ben . i really do .
and someday , you &apos;ll make detective ,
but it will not be on this case .
now ... hand over the file .
trust me --
nothing good comes from this .
daddy ! !
you &apos;re making a mistake ! you &apos;re making a mistake ! !
let go of her ! leave her alone !
to your father &apos;s return home .
so , when are you gonna tell him ?
when he &apos;s ready .
why wait ?
i thought that was the whole point of getting him next door .
this isn &apos;t about me , nolan . it &apos;s about helping him .
after what he &apos;s been through , my father needs time to recover .
i want to win him back honestly -- with the truth .
and when he &apos;s ready , i &apos;ll make sure that he knows that ...
i &apos;m still here .
we used to dance to this .
it was his favorite .
are you ready ?
how did she get this song to play on cue ?
remote control ? motion sensor ?
she didn &apos;t need any of that .
she just had to get him back home .
what did you say your name was , again ?
oh , never mind . it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re going pretty hard tonight .
i don &apos;t want to think anything .
i don &apos;t want to feel anything .
well , in that case ,
i got just what you need back at my place .
then , what are we still doing here ?
never thought i &apos;d be going home with charlotte grayson .
i have come to learn ...
it &apos;s &quot; clarke . &quot;
that evil takes many forms ...
my mistake .
... including those that we think we can trust the most .
the anger this bred almost cost me
the thing that i valued above all else --
my memories of you ,
the daughter i still love
infinity times infinity .
but now i can feel you again ,
which is why i know what i must do ,
for you were wronged , as i was ,
and by someone i trusted .
there must be repercussions .
and i swear to you , amanda ...
i will have revenge .
