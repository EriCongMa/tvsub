putting up decorations for rachel &apos;s birthday party tonight .
you &apos;re not helping ?
i tried ..
but apparently singing &quot; i will survive &quot; in a helium voice , not helping .
hey , guys .
hey .
don &apos;t say that loud . gunther &apos;s gonna want to hug me .
good news , everyone . we finally found a nanny .
this is molly . molly , chandler , joey .
hi .
somebody &apos;s getting a little fussy .
you &apos;re damn right i am . i &apos;ve been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes .
okay . you know what , i &apos;m just gonna take her outside .
no , you stay . i &apos;ll do it .
okay . thank you .
nice to meet you guys .
yeah , you too .
wow , molly &apos;s just great .
yeah .
yes , bravo on the hot nanny .
what ? you really think she &apos;s hot ?
are you kidding ?
if i wasn &apos;t married , she &apos;d be rejecting me right now .
joey ?
how do you think she &apos;s doing ?
am i the only one that doesn &apos;t think she &apos;s hot ? ross ?
i mean , she &apos;s not unattractive , but ..
right .
but hot ?
thank you .
now that rachel &apos;s gone ?
so hot , i cried myself to sleep last night .
the.one.with.phoebes.rats
hey , mike , what &apos;s the capital of peru ?
lima .
no .
it starts with a v and ends with an x.
and hopefully with a t @-@ o in the middle .
you know , come to think of it , the capital of peru is &quot; vtox . &quot;
oh , god !
what ?
okay . i don &apos;t want to freak you out or anything ..
but i just saw a rat in your cupboard .
oh , yeah . no , that &apos;s bob .
well , he &apos;s your pet rat ?
well , not so much a pet as , you know , an occasional visitor ..
who i put food out for . kind of like santa .
except santa doesn &apos;t poop on the plate of cookies .
you can &apos;t keep a rat in your apartment .
they &apos;re unsanitary.i mean , they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus .
what are those ?
i don &apos;t know ..
but they don &apos;t sound like spa treatments .
you have to get rid of it .
okay , fine .
if it means that much to you , i &apos;ll get rid of bob .
thank you .
it &apos;s so weird you think he &apos;s so gross , yet you &apos;re willing to eat his crackers .
hello .
hello .
gavin , i just want to say thank you again ..
for watching emma yesterday during the presentation .
i really owe you an apology .
for what ?
when we first met , you know ..
i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious .
is this your first apology ?
no , i just mean , you know , first impressions don &apos;t mean anything .
and i think you &apos;re a really good guy . and i &apos;m sorry that i misjudged you .
morning .
hello .
but you know what ? hey , new day , new leaf .
i am just really , really happy ..
i &apos;m sorry . obviously , heather &apos;s ass has something more important to say ..
so i &apos;ll just wait till it &apos;s finished .
what ?
i was giving you an apology ..
and you were totally checking her out .
i wasn &apos;t . i &apos;m in fashion . i was looking at her skirt .
or was it pants ? i didn &apos;t really see what happened below the ass area .
wow , you are really .. you &apos;re really a creep .
what do you care if i was looking at her ?
are you jealous ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;m jealous .
&quot; oh , gavin . please , please look at my ass . &quot;
stop looking at my ass !
i mean , i just think you are totally inappropriate . okay ?
this is a work environment . she &apos;s your subordinate .
but it was okay when you slept with your old assistant , tag ?
that is totally different for two reasons .
one : i didn &apos;t know that you knew that .
and two : i wasn &apos;t some creep staring at his ass .
we had a .. we had a deep , meaningful relationship .
what was tag &apos;s last name ?
it was ..
oh , my god .
he didn &apos;t .. he didn &apos;t .. he didn &apos;t have a last name .
it was just tag , you know , like cher or ..
you know , moses .
but it was a deep , meaningful relationship .
you know what ? my first impression of you was absolutely right .
you are arrogant . you are pompous . morgan ! morgan !
tag &apos;s last name was morgan !
it was jones .
what are you , his boyfriend ?
man , i wish i had a nanny like you .
you mean when you were a baby ?
sure .
would you stop staring at her ?
i wasn &apos;t staring .
i was leering .
what &apos;s the big deal with her ?
maybe she &apos;s attractive in an obvious kind of way .
yeah , obvious beauty &apos;s the worst .
you know , when it &apos;s right there in your face .
me , i like to have to work to find someone attractive .
makes me feel like i earned it .
looks like joey &apos;s doing all right with her .
yeah . hey , that was nice of you guys to back off ..
and let joey get the girl for once .
i &apos;m gonna take her to the apartment .
okay . i &apos;ll be home right after work .
okay .
okay , bye , emma .
i love you .
bye .
bye .
they &apos;ve elected me to talk to you about the baby talk .
it &apos;s not so good .
i think it &apos;s sweet .
bye , emma !
hey , listen , joey . about molly , i would really prefer if you didn &apos;t go after her .
why not ?
it took months to find a good nanny .
and i wouldn &apos;t want anything to , you know , drive her away .
so you think i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her ..
and never call her again , and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?
yeah , that sounds about right .
come on , there are plenty of other women out there .
just forget about her , okay ? she &apos;s off @-@ limits .
oh , man ! what &apos;d you have to go and say that for ?
now that you told me i can &apos;t have her , makes me want her even more !
what are you , a child ?
yes !
it &apos;s true . he &apos;s like a little boy , like ben .
just think of him as a really , really , really horny ben .
no !
look , joey , come on now . for me , please .
just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .
fine .
take me home .
do you want a piece of this ?
hey , mikey .
hey , phoebe .
what are you doing ?
setting rattraps .
to kill bob ?
no . no , to test his neck strength .
no , i don &apos;t want to kill him . i thought we were gonna capture him ..
and , you know , set him free in the countryside ..
where he could meet a friendly possum ..
and a wisecracking owl .
okay , okay . i &apos;ll throw away the traps .
all right , i &apos;ll find bob . i &apos;ll get him .
bob ? bob ?
robert ?
wait , i think i hear him .
oh , my god ! bob had babies ! bob &apos;s a mom !
we &apos;ll have to think of a new name .
i don &apos;t know , i kind of like &quot; bob &quot; for a girl .
no , no . i mean , i &apos;m not sure that we ..
oh , my god . we killed bob ?
well , maybe it wasn &apos;t bob . maybe it was a mouse .
susie ?
that &apos;s it ?
it &apos;s over ?
who shot j.r. ?
who shot j.r. ?
i have got to get a job .
what &apos;s up ?
seriously , dude . three years ago .
listen , can you do me a favor ? i &apos;m gonna be out today .
can you keep an eye on joey ..
make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?
you don &apos;t trust him ?
well , no .
some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier ..
and asked for her daughter , the &quot; hot nanny . &quot;
is this your long @-@ term plan , for me to run interference ?
because i could get a job any day now .
you do appear right on the cusp of something .
look , come on , man . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll lose interest in a week or two ..
but for now , could you please just do this for me ?
fine , but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .
because you know once joey sets his mind on something ..
more often than not , he &apos;s going to have sex with it .
well , i mean , we &apos;ve gotta do something . okay ?
nannies like her don &apos;t grow on trees .
picturing that tree ?
i am , yes .
where you going , joe ?
for a walk .
you mind if i join you ?
actually , i &apos;d rather be alone . you know , i really need to organize my thoughts .
your thoughts ?
plural ?
all right , fine . i only have one thought .
it &apos;s about the hot nanny ! i gotta see her !
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you do that , joe .
now you &apos;re saying i can &apos;t see her ?
you &apos;re killing me ! she &apos;s forbidden fruit ! it &apos;s like , like ..
like she &apos;s the princess and i &apos;m the stable boy .
look , i know . she &apos;s the most beautiful woman in the world .
i can hear you .
could you set my pillow and blanket on the couch for me , please ?
why are you doing this , huh ?
did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?
yes , as a matter of fact , he did . so i can &apos;t let you go .
interesting . now there are obstacles .
hot nanny and me against the world !
this is the stuff great novels are made of .
great novels ?
fine . mediocre porn .
gavin mitchell &apos;s office .
rachel greene &apos;s office .
give me that phone .
hello , this is rachel greene . how can i help you ?
okay then . i &apos;ll pass you back to your son .
hey , mom . no , that &apos;s just my secretary .
excuse me , gavin . i have a question i need to ask you .
mom , i &apos;ll call you later . yeah .
yes ?
if you like looking at butts so much ..
why don &apos;t you just go look in a mirror ?
thank god you finally said that .
i saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago .
man , i really bug you . don &apos;t i ?
oh , no . please ..
i don &apos;t care about you enough to bug me .
in fact , from now on , i &apos;m going to take the high road ..
and i &apos;m going to be very , very nice to you , you mama &apos;s boy ..
starting right now .
hey , rach .
hi .
ready for your birthday lunch ?
i am .
but first , monica , i would like to introduce you ..
to my very talented colleague and more importantly ..
my wonderful friend , gavin mitchell .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet you .
are you coming to rachel &apos;s party ?
oh , no , no , no , no . gavin can &apos;t . he already has plans ..
most likely with his mother .
i don &apos;t mind . i &apos;ll cancel them . i would never miss my secretary &apos;s birthday .
why did you invite him ? i can &apos;t stand that guy !
you were being so nice to him .
i was faking it .
can &apos;t you tell when i &apos;m being fake ?
hey , mr. phillips . nice suit .
right there . that was so fake !
hey , chandler , which do you like better ..
the tuna tartare or the mushroom empanadas ?
the pile of raw fish , or the tacos ?
oh , the tacos . definitely , the tacos .
i still can &apos;t believe you invited gavin .
he is just the last person i want to see .
you &apos;re welcome for the party . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having a good time .
i hope he doesn &apos;t show up . of course he won &apos;t , the guy hates me .
does he ?
what ?
maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you .
it &apos;s like in first grade when skippy lange would push me ..
because he secretly had a crush on me .
monica , you think skippy liked you ?
honey , all those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over .
she &apos;s out . i &apos;m gonna take her home .
okay . thank you .
bye , sweetheart .
do you see what all the guys see in her ?
wouldn &apos;t kick her out of bed .
no more vodka for me .
hey , rach . so can i sing &quot; happy birthday &quot; to you now ?
yeah , sure .
all right .
see you later .
hey , rach . somebody got you shoes .
give me !
wow . wow . oh , my god !
careful ! careful !
these are my rat babies !
yeah . we have rat babies now .
you brought rats to my birthday party ?
so this is what a stroke feels like .
well , i had to bring them . we killed their mother .
they &apos;re our responsibility now .
you know , they require constant care . you should know that , you &apos;re a mother .
are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?
no . seven rats .
we should take them home . we need to feed them .
you &apos;re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?
well , i &apos;m sorry , rachel , but i &apos;m not like you . okay ?
not everyone can afford help .
hey , where the hell are joey and molly ?
i asked you to watch them .
i &apos;m sorry . i got a little preoccupied .
look , we have to stop them before something happens .
right behind you , big guy .
so you see , molly , what people don &apos;t understand ..
is that acting is a discipline . it takes a lot of hard work .
so where &apos;d you study ?
i didn &apos;t go to college .
no , where &apos;d you study acting ?
molly , people don &apos;t study acting .
molly , do you mind giving us just a minute ?
sure . i &apos;ll go check on emma .
thanks .
will the stable boy never get the princess ?
what do you think you were gonna do , have sex with her here on my couch ?
no . the leather sticks to my ass .
this isn &apos;t fair . what makes you think i &apos;m gonna sleep with her ..
and then blow her off , huh ?
can &apos;t you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actually like her ..
and might want something real ?
look , the truth is , i haven &apos;t felt this way about anyone since rachel .
okay ? i didn &apos;t think i could ever love again .
come on !
joe !
hi . is molly here ?
yeah , yeah . come on in . molly ?
hey . guys , this is tabitha .
hey .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
okay .
well , joey , i guess we have no problem .
it &apos;s like my favorite fairy tale come true .
the princess , the stable boy and the lesbian .
okay . okay , you start preparing the formula ..
and i &apos;ll start changing the box .
and then we gotta put them straight to bed .
when did we become one of those couples ..
whose lives revolve around their rats ?
well , you know what ? they &apos;re our responsibility now .
okay , fine . these rats are our responsibility .
what happens when they mate and there are hundreds ?
mate ? they &apos;re all brothers and sisters .
yeah , not such a problem with rats .
no , they &apos;re more of a &quot; love the one you &apos;re with &quot; kind of animal .
no . really ?
oh , my .. get off your sister !
oh , my god . what are we gonna do ?
the .. we have seven rats .
so , what if each of them has seven rats ..
and then each of those has seven rats ? that &apos;s like ..
that &apos;s math i can &apos;t even do !
what are we gonna do ?
well , i know this is gonna sound crazy ..
but we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .
yeah , okay . i guess you &apos;re right .
all right , so we should just give them away .
but to nice families with children and reduced @-@ fat wheat thins .
those were bob &apos;s favorites .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you must think i &apos;m crazy .
no , i think you &apos;re sweet .
good . this is just so hard . it &apos;s hard for me to let them go .
i guess it just brings back memories , you know ..
from when i gave birth to my brother &apos;s triplets and i had to give them up .
i haven &apos;t told you about that yet , have i ?
thanks for the party , honey . should i help you clean up ?
no way . you had your party . now i have mine .
is everything all right ?
i just get bummed ..
when my birthday &apos;s over .
well , at least you have one thing to be happy about .
that jerk , gavin , from your office didn &apos;t show up .
yeah , i hate him .
we weren &apos;t talking about you . we were ..
no . no way to recover . no . okay .
fun party .
well , it was .
and you would have seen it if you didn &apos;t show up at ..
9 : 30 ? ! god ! this party was lame .
again , you &apos;re welcome !
look , i &apos;ll just give you this and go .
you bought me a present . why ?
let me explain how birthday parties usually work . there are presents ..
and a cake , perhaps a fourth or fifth person .
okay , i ..
i got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you .
well , okay . well , that &apos;s very nice . and you wrote a card .
&quot; from gavin . &quot;
i really mean it .
it &apos;s beautiful .
if you don &apos;t mind .. ? let me .
well , what do you know , it fits .
see , gavin . you &apos;re capable of being a nice guy .
why do you give me such a hard time ?
i &apos;m not sure .
well , monica seems to think it &apos;s because you have feelings for me .
i do have feelings for you .
you do ?
yes . i feel that you &apos;re a little annoying .
see , why ? gavin , why ?
right when i &apos;m about to change my opinion of you , you go and you ..
and you do that .
hey . listen , i think i left something here .
well , somebody left this . is this yours ?
no , but i like it .
no , i think i left one of my rat babies .
well , no . i haven &apos;t seen it , but if i do , i &apos;ll let you know .
rat baby ! rat baby ! rat baby ! rat baby !
