the woman tried to kill me .
if i drop louise , it could provoke her .
you slept with her .
you can have something that all these other people can &apos;t .
what &apos;s that ?
anything you want .
how about i offer a million above asking ?
it &apos;s your place now .
i &apos;ll call it in .
that &apos;s the type of knife
that &apos;s presumed to have killed conrad grayson .
charlotte had quite a bit to say before leaving town .
let &apos;s start with emily is her sister .
what do you want ?
your assurance that ,
when this thing with your dad explodes ,
none of it lands on me .
done . you won &apos;t even cross my mind .
you could have come for me , but you didn &apos;t .
you could have come for me !
amanda . it &apos;s you .
victoria .
she &apos;s not breathing .
here . call 911 !
okay . come on .
call for help ! she &apos;s dying !
victoria . oh , thank god .
no . give me the phone .
911 . what is your emergency ?
i need an ambulance at , uh , 3342 old montauk highway .
someone &apos;s been electrocuted by a power line .
she &apos;s unconscious , but breathing .
margaux , margaux , wait , wait , wait .
come back upstairs . let me explain .
no , there &apos;s nothing to explain .
i &apos;ve become the target of a jealous mental patient
because of your inability to keep it your in pants .
it meant nothing , okay ?
i was so determined not to lose her as a client
that i went too far .
okay ? i &apos;m sorry .
only because you got caught .
and it &apos;s not even the sex . it &apos;s the lies .
i thought maybe you had changed .
but i can &apos;t believe i let myself fall in love with you .
hold on . what ? you &apos;re in ... you &apos;re in love with me ?
no , no , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i can be better .
that &apos;s what makes this so hard .
margaux lemarchal .
as i live and breathe , what a lovely surprise .
want to come up to my room
for some martinis and girl talk ?
so you can try to poison me ?
i &apos;m onto your little game , louise .
whatever are you talking about ?
drop the act .
you locked me in that steam room on purpose .
oh , that &apos;s funny .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t got any missed calls from the authorities .
that must mean you don &apos;t have any proof .
oh , the lengths you &apos;ve gone to be with daniel ...
seem to have succeeded ,
considering how quickly you just stormed out of his building .
except for one little problem ...
you made an enemy out of me
in the process .
nolan ? finally .
been looking everywhere for you and emily .
there &apos;s no hiding from the southampton p.d.
how did you find me ?
you tweeted a photo of this view
with the hashtag &quot; never leaving . &quot;
oh , yeah .
i know why you guys are avoiding me .
i &apos;m not , jack .
i never got any of your calls .
that brag @-@ tag of the view
was my phone &apos;s last act before committing cell @-@ icide .
don &apos;t ask .
this morning , i told emily the investigation
into conrad &apos;s murder was pointing towards david .
the next thing i know , ben and i find an o.d. &apos; d john doe
with the murder weapon .
now , she was clearly framing the guy ,
but , nolan ...
did emily ... kill him ?
okay , you &apos;re half @-@ right .
emily only planted the knife ...
oh , thank god .
after ... charlotte killed him .
what ? !
jack , it was self @-@ defense .
t @-@ the guy was a scumbag . he had it coming .
he was using charlotte to get to david and take him out .
emily &apos;s playing with fire here , man .
if ... if she didn &apos;t cover her tracks ,
we &apos;re all gonna get burned .
let &apos;s hope she did , jack ,
because i &apos;m still recovering from the first degree
i got from your dear old dad @-@ in @-@ law .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened , man .
oh , don &apos;t cry for me , sergeant @-@ ina .
i &apos;ll find a way to change those headlines .
now ...
if emily would only tell her father the truth ,
all our problems would be solved .
okay . got it ?
yeah .
don &apos;t feel bad about not helping .
you were scared .
i wasn &apos;t scared .
she didn &apos;t deserve my help , or yours .
what ? she was in need .
i was in need my whole life .
you were alive while the person
that you thought was your daughter suffered ...
while i suffered ...
and you did nothing . why ?
we have to move . you coming ?
please , i need to know .
ems ? i &apos;m in .
what have you got ?
oh , good news and bad news .
victoria &apos;s still alive .
what &apos;s the good news ?
they &apos;re keeping her heavily sedated
to monitor the irregular rhythm of her heart .
turns out she has one .
i &apos;m still not hearing any good news .
this means you can talk to your father
without her running interference .
he made it very clear he does not want to talk to me .
yeah , and he reacted that way because he watched his daughter
refuse to help a woman who was practically struck by lightning .
once you explain how victoria betrayed him ,
he will regret ever being cpr @-@ certified .
what about the photos ?
he had no explanation for them .
uh , you didn &apos;t give him much of a chance ,
confronting him the way you did .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re defending him
after everything that he &apos;s done .
ems , i &apos;m not .
i @-@ i &apos;m just trying to be rational .
look , victoria &apos;s dance with the downed power line
has given you a second chance to win your father back .
but this time , you &apos;re gonna have to do it calmly ,
and you &apos;re gonna have to do it soon ,
before that black heart of hers starts ticking on its own again .
oh , thank heavens .
someone who can finally help me .
this is an emergency .
what is it ?
well , my dearest friend , victoria grayson ,
has been in a terrible accident , and i must see her .
well , are you family ?
oh , practically .
just ask daniel . he &apos;ll surely vouch for me .
well , mr. grayson is not here ,
and you shouldn &apos;t be , either , so let &apos;s go .
oh . oh , okay , okay .
well , you know , instead of manhandling me ,
could you just give these to her on my behalf ?
please . they &apos;re her favorite .
okay .
excuse us .
you never brought me flowers
when i was in the hospital .
then again , you put me there .
not now , mama .
then when , lou @-@ lou ? hmm ?
you &apos;ve wasted so much time on your pathetic plan .
you need to find a way into mother grayson &apos;s heart
or it &apos;s gonna close up , just like mine did .
and what , exactly , is your brilliant idea ?
well , big daddy &apos;s mother
couldn &apos;t stand the sight of me ...
that is , until your brother
started kicking the inside of my stomach .
and how , exactly , am i supposed to get pregnant
with victoria &apos;s grandchild
if danny said he won &apos;t sleep with me again ?
oh , men say a lot of things , lou @-@ lou .
but they only want one .
hey , aren &apos;t you partners with that guy
that found conrad grayson &apos;s murderer ?
i hear he &apos;s a stud .
oh , cool your jets .
it could have been anyone who answered that call .
yeah , but it was us .
and get this . word is , the feds took over ,
and they &apos;re bringing in some locals to help .
where did you hear that ?
i have my sources .
feds ? sources ?
all you need now is a mustache , magnum .
i kept telling you this case was gonna pay off for me .
porter . meet agent taylor .
she &apos;s the fbi liaison
running point on the grayson murder .
please , call me kate .
ben hunter . very happy to offer my services .
i &apos;m more familiar with this case than anyone here .
well , i find that hard to believe ,
given your partner &apos;s history with the major players .
that &apos;s why i was trying to keep my distance .
however , ben here knows the case file inside and out .
agent taylor has requested
that you walk her through the case .
hunter , you &apos;re flying solo .
and we are going to do everything that we can
to make kate comfortable in our house .
copy that .
congrats , partner .
excuse me .
let &apos;s get started .
mr. grayson . how &apos;s your mother doing ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be fine .
good .
the press must have made it sound more serious that it is .
yeah .
oh , one more thing .
this was left for you .
thanks .
someone started without me .
all right .
so you want to play .
have it your way .
oh , no .
louise ?
who were you expectin &apos; , silly ?
oh , miss .
can i help you ?
uh , i &apos;m here to see victoria grayson .
oh , you , too , huh ?
i don &apos;t think so .
look , it &apos;s family only , all right ?
so if you aren &apos;t on this list ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do for you .
she is family .
yeah . we need to talk .
what the hell were you thinking ?
i knew you and margaux had a lover &apos;s quarrel .
i just thought you might like to blow off some steam .
by tricking me into sleeping with you ?
it wasn &apos;t a trick .
you wrote me a note on lemarchal &apos;s stationary ,
you lunatic .
y @-@ you know what ? i &apos;m done . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m dropping you as a client ,
and i &apos;m gonna make damn sure that you &apos;re sent back
to the institution you crawled out of .
how dare you judge me ?
i never did that to you , not once !
i am the only person in manhattan
that even gave you the time of day .
i &apos;ve been nothing but good to you .
that doesn &apos;t excuse your actions .
you don &apos;t know me or what i &apos;ve been through .
you have no idea how good you have it .
you &apos;re just a stubborn ,
self @-@ involved bastard who won &apos;t even visit
his sick mother in the hospital .
get out .
oh , get out of here !
well , well , well , nolan ross .
here he is , folks ...
the reason why you won &apos;t be drinking today .
are you trying to get me killed ?
these people are too rich to be sober .
i just came here to tell you in person i quit .
look , look , look . i get it .
change of ownership means you get to negotiate up .
i respect that . name your price .
i don &apos;t want your money .
from what i saw on tv ,
it &apos;s not even yours to begin with .
come on , guys .
all right . let &apos;s get out of here .
all right . let &apos;s go .
well , i take it i will be reading about this mutiny
in your rags tomorrow .
oh , i actually came to congratulate
you on this surprising acquisition .
well , after you allowed david
to tar and feather me on live tv ,
i had to seek refuge from the masses .
just like i tried to do yesterday in your steam room .
i had no idea i was taking my life in my hands .
i &apos;m going to have a hard time keeping that out of my rags .
wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
but ...
there &apos;s something i can do to make it all go away , right ?
louise ellis .
she has a membership here , and i recently discovered
she also has a sealed criminal record
that only you can hack into .
oh , i just met louise , but i already like her .
she &apos;s a sweetheart .
she &apos;s a violent psychopath who needs to be locked up .
oh , margaux , let &apos;s be honest .
i &apos;ve known my fair share of psychopaths , and
little southern sally is anything but ...
oh , besides ,
any enemy of yours is a friend of mine .
no deal .
it &apos;s vince walsh .
served some time upstate for assault
with a deadly weapon a few years back .
he had some misdemeanors , but nothing too serious .
the building &apos;s owner said he paid rent in cash .
so no money trail . what about his phone ?
it &apos;s a burner . it &apos;s empty .
there &apos;s no saved numbers or texts .
he must have been erasing as he went .
yeah , i already did a trace on the knife to see
where and when it was purchased to make sure it was his .
it was found on his person .
his dna is all over it .
never assume , rookie .
could have been planted .
i &apos;ve seen this before .
this was captured by a security camera at the parking lot
where the car that
tried to run down david clarke was stolen .
why didn &apos;t we have access to this ?
yeah , we &apos;re the fbi ,
the prime beneficiaries of the freedom act .
there .
so the guy who murdered conrad grayson
also tried to take out david clarke .
so what &apos;s next ?
you tell me .
we have to talk to david clarke .
bingo .
the doctor says the next few hours are critical ,
but she expects victoria to recover .
but i &apos;m sure you wanted otherwise .
you don &apos;t understand .
i think i do .
when you said that you didn &apos;t help victoria on purpose ,
i was shocked .
the amanda that i remember ,
she cared about every living creature .
but i am not the man that i was ,
and i expect that the life that you &apos;ve lived
has hardened you , too .
hardened me ?
you have no idea what i &apos;ve been through
because of what she did .
she took everything from us . she &apos;s lying to you .
how can &apos;t you see that ?
you &apos;re lying , too .
why are you pretending to be somebody else ?
i did it all for you .
to punish the people who hurt you .
i would have done anything for the dad that i lost .
but you &apos;re right . you &apos;re not that man .
you were alive the whole time .
those photos prove that you were right there .
if i was ...
there is nothing that would have kept me
from getting to you .
i did not take those photos .
then who did ?
code blue !
doctor ! what &apos;s happening ? !
bring in the crash cart .
lost her pulse .
charge the paddles .
yes , doctor .
gel .
gel .
completely charged .
you &apos;re charged to 200 .
wait .
hold .
i think we &apos;re stable .
standing by . doctor ?
her rhythm &apos;s back .
david .
oh , god .
victoria . it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s okay .
your rhythm has returned to normal ,
and your levels are stabilizing nicely .
you were very lucky that , when you got shocked ,
david was there to administer cpr .
you saved my life ?
i &apos;d like to take you up for an mri ,
if you feel up to it .
i think i can manage as long as david accompanies me .
okay , great .
actually , i &apos;ll need a moment of his time .
agent kate taylor from the fbi .
what is this about ?
that &apos;s between me and mr. clarke .
it &apos;s okay , victoria . it &apos;s okay .
did we meet when i was in d.c. ?
no . i &apos;m from criminal investigation .
i &apos;m here about conrad grayson &apos;s murder .
the body of a man was discovered with a knife
that had conrad grayson &apos;s dna on it .
what does that have to do with me ?
i have reason to believe that this is the same man
who tried to run you down last week .
ever seen him before ?
you &apos;re a granddad now .
one more life in your hands .
uh , he doesn &apos;t look familiar .
our records suggest he may have been taking orders
from someone else , so
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to come with me for your protection .
well , as i told your , uh , bosses in d.c. ,
i , uh , finally have my life ,
and i want to live it free of their intrusion .
also , i &apos;m not leaving the hospital until victoria &apos;s recovered .
so if that &apos;s all ...
just a few more questions , mr. clarke .
emily ?
what are you doing here ?
jack , hey .
sorry i haven &apos;t returned your calls .
well , if you had , you &apos;d know the fbi is in town ,
investigating that o.d. and conrad &apos;s murder .
they have an agent talking to your dad right now .
i saw . did she order a trace on the murder weapon yet ?
as a matter of fact , she did .
it &apos;s gonna lead right back to the man you found it on .
i made sure of it .
conrad grayson was a monster .
the world doesn &apos;t care who killed him .
they &apos;re just happy he &apos;s dead .
the fbi wants this case closed asap , trust me .
i hope you &apos;re right .
&apos;cause i can &apos;t take much more of this .
wait , if you &apos;re here , did you tell him ?
what happened ?
we were interrupted .
there &apos;s still ...
a lot that i don &apos;t understand , but ...
it &apos;s a start .
yeah .
officer porter .
yeah , okay . thank you .
home office finished the trace .
the knife that killed conrad did belong to vince .
looks like he &apos;s our perp .
that &apos;s good news .
for you . that means i owe you a drink .
looks like today you &apos;re the one that needs cheering up ,
so ... let me return the favor .
my new bartender &apos;s the best .
your bartender ?
well , i followed your advice to take what i wanted .
turns out it was this club .
well , getting what you want is , uh ,
easier said than done sometimes .
why ? you &apos;re a one @-@ percenter .
well , not everything can be bought , i &apos;m afraid .
but i &apos;m so glad
you got this little slice of happiness , hmm ?
i &apos;m in the service industry now ,
so my happiness is contingent on yours .
what say we see how many drinks it takes
to make me good at my job ?
those photos ...
who took them ?
how did you have them ?
how did you have them ?
you stole them from my safe @-@ deposit box ,
and you took that knife .
the investigation of conrad &apos;s murder was heating up .
i had to lead them away from you .
by handing them my knife ? if they link that to me ...
they won &apos;t .
i &apos;ve traced everything back to him .
you &apos;re completely clean .
who are you ?
a daughter who would do anything to protect her father .
protecting me , that &apos;s not your job .
that &apos;s why i told you in my journals to forgive .
those journals detailed every single person
who had a part in destroying you .
what did you expect me to do ?
you killed conrad . what kind of forgiveness is that ?
that &apos;s my decision for my life !
it &apos;s not the one i wanted for you .
i was never gonna have a normal life ,
thanks to people like victoria , who stole it away from me .
you &apos;re wrong about victoria . y @-@ you were only 9 years old .
how dare you take her word over mine ? !
i am your daughter .
you don &apos;t know the whole story .
neither do you .
i dedicated my entire life to you .
i punished your enemies . i cleared you name .
i never asked for your help !
i have a distinct feeling of deja vu .
we had a deal .
you were gonna stay out of it .
i don &apos;t want to fight .
then why are you here ?
well , i was feeling a little guilty
about not visiting my mother in the hospital ,
but only made it as far as this beach ,
looked over , saw you ,
and curiosity got the best of me .
well , now that is satisfied ,
the hospital &apos;s only a few miles that way .
wait , are you crying &apos; cause my mother survived ?
ah , you always did try to save me from her .
and you just kept crawling back .
oh , says the girl obsessed with her .
i heard you made it to the hospital .
you wanted to see your handiwork ?
only karma can claim responsibility for that .
oh . so you told him , didn &apos;t you ?
listen , i know firsthand you can fake tears ,
but i bet real ones don &apos;t come easy .
you dedicated your life to a father you barely knew ,
what did you expect to happen ?
i expected to have a chance .
but at least i had the guts
to stand up to your vile mother .
oh , so that &apos;s it , is it ?
one fight with dad and you &apos;re giving up ?
okay .
well , glad to know
the hell you put me through was for nothing .
what a waste .
david .
how are you feeling ?
tired .
but much better .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what do you remember about last night ?
we were on the couch .
you noticed my earrings .
then ...
emily came through the door .
she was so angry .
she &apos;s not emily thorne .
she &apos;s my daughter , victoria .
she &apos;s amanda .
i need the truth . did you know ?
i never could find you
in the eyes of the girl claiming to be amanda .
so i had a dna test done ,
which emily changed to prolong her lie .
as time went on ,
i became more and more convinced of the truth ,
so i confronted her .
she attacked me and had me locked up .
so you knew ... that she was my daughter ,
and you painted her as an enemy ?
she is my enemy , david .
things transpired between us that can &apos;t be undone .
and i knew that she would have to come out on her own terms .
i was terrified that if i told you or anyone else ,
she would put me away again ,
and i couldn &apos;t go back there , david .
david .
it must be overwhelming .
but it is the god &apos;s truth .
just get some rest .
the nurse gave you something to help you sleep .
so what &apos;s it like , being a southern kennedy ?
oh , no .
don &apos;t tell me you bought into that hogwash ?
oh , trust me .
my mama was definitely no jackie o .
the only thing i &apos;ve read about your big brother , lyman ,
has made him out to be congress &apos; golden boy .
well , everything i &apos;ve seen
makes you out to be the bad guy .
people will believe whatever they read ,
which is why i always go with my gut .
... which is oversaturated at the moment .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .

what ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
can &apos;t i just have a normal friend ?
mr. clarke , will you be spending the night ?
yeah . yeah , dr. albright said it &apos;d be fine .
it is . we just need you to fill out some forms .
you &apos;re coming with us .
what are you doing ?
stop or she &apos;s dead .
okay !
okay . i &apos;ll do anything .
don &apos;t hurt her .
i was never here .
what happened ? is anyone hurt ?
thank you for meeting me .
i know i didn &apos;t deserve your help
after the way i spoke to you .
you owe me an explanation .
you &apos;re right . i do .
the story about me being stabbed in prison
as a cover to sneak me out is true .
but it wasn &apos;t conrad .
it was a rival of his who was ... much worse .
this man asked me to do terrible things .
but i refused .
until he showed me a photo of a girl
that i thought was my daughter .
he threatened to kill her if i didn &apos;t cooperate .
so i did what i had to do ...
... until i heard about her death .
and then , the next day , i escaped ,
but not before i made him pay for what he did to me .
where did you go ?
off the grid .
till i heard about conrad and my name being cleared .
that was your doing , wasn &apos;t it ?
i am so proud of you , amanda .
but i can &apos;t be your father .
why ?
you saw what happened in there .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
you should let me help you .
no . i already lost you once .
i &apos;m not gonna let it happen again .
you have to let me take care of this .
it &apos;s my turn to protect you .
i love you , amanda ...
... infinity times infinity .
right here , sir .
daniel , you came .
daniel , please .
you know , margaux told me she loved me last night .
i wanted to ... say it back ,
but i don &apos;t even know
if i &apos;m capable of feeling anything real anymore .
i &apos;ve closed myself off to it .
and it would be real easy to blame emily for that ,
but this goes further back .
seeing what you &apos;re doing to david now ,
knowing what you were capable of all those years ago ...
you blame me ?
you think you really know what happened ?
well , here it is .
your father &apos;s business practices
forced me to make a despicable choice .
it was either my lover &apos;s life or my son ,
and i sacrificed david and chose you .
daniel , i will always choose you .
no . no . this is what you do .
this is exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
there is always an explanation for how and why you love
because you &apos;re terrified to be alone .
look at you now . you &apos;re alone .
so thanks . thanks , mom . thanks .
thanks for being a cautionary tale ...
one that i won &apos;t dare let happen to me .
yeah , you can put it there . thank you .
listen , i &apos;m sorry about everything .
can i just ... i just need to see you .
wow . resorting to actual research ?
oh , margie , you know it &apos;s never wise
to show desperation in the middle of a negotiation .
negotiation ?
does this mean you &apos;ve reconsidered my offer ?
it means i &apos;ve come to counter .
and while i do admit that my interest in the subject
has been piqued since we last spoke ,
my price for unsealing criminal records and the like
has just gone up considerably .
and what do you want ?
well , since that travesty
you called an interview with david clarke ,
public &apos;s practically drawing
horns and a pointy tail on my image .
and let me guess .
you would prefer angel wings and a halo .
well ... well , that &apos;s a start .
and then it burned down .
that &apos;s too bad .
sounds like the stowaway was my kind of place .
it was ...
it was my home since i was a kid , you know .
i haven &apos;t had roots like that in a long time .
bureau moves me around a lot .
where are you from originally ?
up north , where a girl could only dream
about growing up this close to the ocean .
must have been nice .
selfishly , i was hoping that , uh ,
this case would last the whole summer .
well , you work fast .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
whoa , man .
hey , sorry .
hey , hey . sorry , guys . next round &apos;s on me .
oh , look who it is .
it &apos;s detective porter to the rescue .
come on , man . let &apos;s ... let &apos;s get you home .
so it &apos;s you and the fed , huh ? you guys on a little date ,
or did the bureau already offer you a job ?
or is it both ?
that &apos;s enough .
screw you , man .
what is your problem ?
you &apos;re my problem .
you &apos;ve been here all of what , a month ?
man , i been busting my ass on the force for years .
you and i both know that that should be me . oh !
you think i like being constantly reminded
of the man who took my family away from me ?
i never wanted this case . you know that .
this isn &apos;t about me . it &apos;s about you .
for some reason , you think that the whole world
is out to screw you , and it is not .
there will be other cases .
if you don &apos;t let this one go ...
you &apos;re gonna lose your badge , man .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah . i &apos;m fine . sorry .
so , your dad won &apos;t tell you
who actually kept him prisoner all these years ?
no .
and i think it &apos;s for the best .
what ? !
this conrad wannabe is one of the only things
that is keeping you from finally reuniting with your father .
look , he doesn &apos;t want me to be a part of it .
he asked me to promise .
but , ems ...
i made up my mind .
i want a relationship with my father .
he said he &apos;s gonna take care of it , so until then ,
i &apos;ll just keep chipping away at the hold victoria has on him .
i &apos;ve got a little crazy missile with her name on it .
