Listen to me, man.
I've been where you are.
Please believe me when I tell you,
the party you're going to is nothing but trouble.
Jerome?
Does Jerome have 30 days sober?
I don't think so.
You got to learn to appreciate a quiet night in.
I know it's hard.
That's why you've got me.
And I'm already home, baby -- headed to bed.
You don't believe me?
Morning.
Morning.
Did you read the label?
I know how to make coffee.
Your last pot tasted like motor oil.
That was an anomaly.
How was I supposed to know it was espresso beans?
By reading the label.
Well, obviously, this time I read the label,
and I just happen to like espresso beans.
Mm-hmm. And if it's too strong for you...
that's too bad because I'm gonna drink it
just like it is.
That's right.
You are. Every drop.
Rizzoli.
No, you have the wrong number.
Yes, I'm sure.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Where is Maura? We're gonna be late.
I'm here.
What are you doing?
I've got some lower back pain,
so I'm attempting a new relaxation technique.
It looks like lying on the floor and sighing.
Well, it's more sophisticated than that.
Well, do you feel relaxed?
Not entirely.
How about now?
Rizzoli.
No, I can't help you.
Because this isn't an escort service!
Yes, I'm sure. I d--
I can't -- wha--
Rizzoli.
Oh, really? With the heavy breathing?
Come on.
And why are you getting an escort at this hour?
Shouldn't you be at work?
Well, shouldn't you be looking for work?
No, I will not help you "Work on your résumé."
Gross.
You know, you are a public servant,
And clearly this guy needs some service.
Oh, shut up and drink your sludge.
I don't know what happened.
A-a telemarketer must have gotten my number, you know,
And -- and...
I'm done.
Listen to me, you pervert.
I don't have the time...
to facilitate some weird fantasy
from some basement-dwelling mouth breather
with too much access to the internet, so you can go f--
Isles.
Rizzoli.
第六季 第十一集
Another wrong number.
That is the fifth call that I've gotten like that.
And I block every single one of them.
This is getting ridiculous.
Well, perhaps the department could issue you a new number.
I've put the request in.
They're just taking their sweet time about it.
It sounds awful.
One guy asked me to...
"Wax his banister."
That's not a thing.
I know.
Nobody calls it that.
Well, what did you say?
W--
I can't, um, say to you... right now.
What are we talking about?
Euphemisms for the male phallus.
Victim is Dan Walsh, 27.
According to his landlord, he lived here about two years.
Is he a parolee?
He worked for a nonprofit
that keeps troubled kids off the street.
I guess he lived where he worked.
No witnesses.
Struggles and arguments
are pretty much par for the course around here.
Security systems?
Padlocks and baseball bats.
Definitely no cameras.
Maybe it's just a robbery gone wrong.
Left his wallet and cellphone behind.
I think someone just wanted him dead.
Which he is.
We know how?
Subdural hemorrhaging around the trachea and larynx.
Acute cause of death appears to be asphyxia.
So he was strangled.
I'm inclined to say yes, though the ligature mark
is less distinct than I'd expect.
According to his texts, he died around 9:30 last night.
That's consistent with rigor and lividity.
He has a selfie with his murderer.
Yeah, too bad he didn't have one of those selfie sticks.
To use as a weapon.
And achieve a universally flattering angle.
Dan Walsh.
DMV records show he moved to Boston about two years ago.
Originally from Los Angeles.
He have any family here or anybody we could talk to?
Doesn't seem to.
He's just been living at that one address
and working at the center for troubled teens.
Maybe one of the kids turned against him.
A co-worker said he was a rock star.
And every kid we talked to
said he's the reason why they turned their lives around.
He didn't have an emergency contact in his DMV records,
And I can't find a last-known address in California.
According to social security, there's no work history, either.
Oh, so he's a criminal.
A lot of people at the center
said he was secretive about his past.
Okay, so he's got a troubled past, he goes straight,
starts working with kids
so they don't make the same mistake he does.
Maybe his past caught up to him.
I buy it.
I would, too,
Except he doesn't have a record.
Prints are clean.
Well, that just means he didn't get caught.
We running him through NCIC?
As we speak.
Well, maybe he's wanted for questioning somewhere,
or he got a parking ticket in Topeka.
Anything to help us figure out what his story is.
And why he's dead.
How's it coming?
Good. I mean, not for him.
He's dead.
From?
Ligature-strangulation homicide.
The abrasions appear to be scratches
from the victim's own fingernails.
Ah, he put up a fight.
Do we know what he was strangled with?
The faintness of the markings suggests a soft material,
like a necktie or a cloth.
And based on the contusions around the Adam's apple,
it probably had a knot tied in the middle.
Makes for a quicker kill.
The hyoid bone was completely crushed.
This killer knew what he was doing.
There's a reason the fingerprints we ran
didn't bring us anything on Dan Walsh --
That ain't Dan Walsh.
Says who?
Detective from Los Angeles Robbery Homicide Division just called.
He said, "Why are you running Dan Walsh
through NCIC?"
I said, "Well, he's a homicide victim."
Detective says, "Huh. That's funny,"
Because they have a Dan Walsh on the table in their morgue.
They have the same identity?
Yeah, they were found dead within three days of each other.
Well, that can't be a coincidence.
Well, do we know how the L.A. victim died?
He just said it was a likely homicide.
The body was found in a shallow grave,
uncovered by some construction workers.
No I.D., but the fingerprints and the dental records
were definitive.
Their guy is Dan Walsh.
Which means our guy...
just became John Doe.
L.A. Coroner's Office says Dan Walsh
looks to have been dead for about two years.
Which is the exact time
that our guy has been living in Boston
under Dan Walsh's identity.
So maybe our John Doe killed Dan Walsh
and then stole his I.D. to start a new life?
Whitey Bulger lived under an assumed identity for years.
Yeah, but we ran his prints,
and whoever this guy is, he doesn't have a record.
Still, he could be running from something.
Well, all we know for sure
is that in the past at some point,
our John Doe intersected with Dan Walsh.
Yep. Or someone with Dan Walsh's I.D.
All roads lead to Dan Walsh.
So if we're gonna figure out who our John Doe is...
Unh-unh. Don't say it.
You are going to L.A.
Yes!
No!
Come on!
I don't like to fly, and -- and I get jet-lagged,
and L.A. is so not my style.
It's okay. We'll suck it up just this once.
Not you, Frankie.
The department will only pay for one detective.
But the homicide unit in L.A. is eager to collaborate.
So is the Coroner's Office.
I've been on the phone with the L.A. coroner all morning.
Initial findings of their victim
suggest ligature-strangulation homicide.
The same as our guy.
The thing is, no autopsy's been performed,
and due to the backlog, there isn't one scheduled.
Makes sense -- big city.
So is Boston.
Yeah, but they don't have Maura -- the backlog killer.
Thank you.
The details of the L.A. murder
might inform our analysis of John Doe's murder.
Especially if they were killed by the same person.
Well, I offered to come to L.A. personally
and facilitate the autopsy, and they agreed.
Wait. So they both get to go?
You're welcome to go with them if you pay your own way.
Fine. I don't want to go.
I'm gonna stay here and drink espresso...naked.
I'm gonna take a bath in espresso.
I don't need that visual, bro.
Well, this should be fun.
Sox games are fun.
Cronuts -- very fun.
There's not really a word to accurately describe Los Angeles.
Well, maybe we can find one while we're there.
Goody.
欢迎使用自助服务
Hi. Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.
I'm -- I'm trying to upgrade my rental,
but this machine thingy won't let me do it.
Let me pull up your reservation.
Thank you.
First time using one of these, huh?
Yeah. It's kind of weird.
It's like you're here, but you're not here.
I wish I was there. I love L.A.
But I'm stuck in Boston.
Oh, you're kidding.
Roxbury.
That's where I work!
We're neighbors!
Okay, to upgrade your car,
insert the credit card you want to use.
Okay.
Hello!
What, really? That's like your third one.
I know. I can't help myself.
There's a juice bar on every corner.
That looks delicious. Strawberry?
Strawberry mango.
Oh, this time of year?
Right? Look at all that vitamin A!
How we doing?
Looks like the problem's your credit card.
It was declined.
It was?
Did you notify the bank that you're traveling?
Sometimes that sets off a fraud alert.
No, I guess I didn't.
Yeah, but I don't want to drive what BPD rented for us.
It looks like a toaster had sex with a clown car.
Okay. Okay.
Well, here.
Let's splurge.
It is L.A., after all.
Anything particular in mind?
Something stylish.
And fast.
Tasteful. Not too flashy.
Yeah, and really fast.
I got something.
Hey, Vince.
Liquor license renewal form -- it's all filled out.
You just have to sign it.
Mm. I'll do it right now.
So, it looks like the girls made it to L.A.
Safe and sound.
Which means you and I have a golden opportunity.
For what exactly?
A double date.
No snooping kids --
you, Kiki, me, and Ron.
Well, that's a great idea. Mm.
I can't wait to meet Ron.
And he can't wait to meet you guys.
How's tonight?
I'll bring wine.
All right.
8:00-ish?
Deal.
Good wine, Vince.
Of course.
Really?
Bud Abbott!
You can't just walk over him.
It's a sidewalk, not a grave.
Why do you get to drive?
You're not insured.
Really? You just happen to have one of those things handy?
I mean, Jackie O.
It's going to be windy.
Would you like one?
No, I would like to drive.
Not today.
Please start the car.
It's a turbo.
Yeah, it is.
If the discovery of Dan Walsh's body
prompted our victim's murder,
then at least one other person
knew he was living under an assumed identity.
But why would that person want to kill him?
Did the news of Dan Walsh's body being
dug up go national?
Nope. Just a few mentions on the local news
and in the L.A. Times.
Chances are that's where the killer heard about it.
Meaning that whoever did it is from L.A.
Or was there at the time Walsh's body was discovered.
That would mean they had to fly here to kill the imposter,
given our timeline.
Well, let's pull the manifests from flights for L.A. to Boston
around the time of John Doe's murder.
Okay.
And then check those against the list
of people making return trips after the murder.
Gonna be a lot of names.
Well, you got to start somewhere.
And we're still interviewing kids at the youth center,
But so far,
our John Doe seems like a stand-up guy.
Whatever got him killed...
It was from his past.
Oh. Detective Rizzoli?
Yeah.
Oscar Acedo.
Hey.
Welcome to our coast.
Thank you.
Not in Kansas anymore, huh?
You could say that.
You let me know if I can help you adjust.
I'm L.A. Born-and-raised.
Okay. How do I adjust to people
who just walk right out in front of cars?
Moving cars?
'Cause we almost killed two yoga moms
and some guy dressed as Edward scissorhands
on Hollywood Boulevard.
Car always has to stop, even if they're jaywalking.
It can get a little crazy.
What do we got here?
Dan Walsh -- last seen two years ago
at a homeless shelter in Venice.
He was homeless?
Yeah, but he was a regular at the shelter.
I know what you're thinking.
If a homeless shelter files a missing persons for a transient,
then surely someone noticed
when your John Doe disappeared.
That's exactly what I'm thinking.
Me too.
We're running a search
for anyone resembling your victim, as well.
Oh, this is Dr. Maura Isles.
Chief medical examiner of the commonwealth.
We're lucky to have her expertise.
Well, Dr. Hart has been exceedingly welcoming.
We just returned from the autopsy.
It was thrilling.
Was it?
As we suspected, the victim
suffered a fracture of the laryngeal cartilage.
Tell her about the disarticulation of the hyoid horns.
In a strangulation like this,
the hyoid bone can shift to the side --
which side depends on whether the assailant
was left- or right-handed.
This victim's pattern of disarticulation
was the same as our victim's.
So they were killed by the same person.
That's possible, but it's also possible that the victims
were killed by two different left-hand dominant people.
Of roughly the same height and physical build.
Because they were killed by the same person.
I wouldn't speculate.
There are more of you.
We got something here.
What, a hit on the search?
Yeah, but it's not missing persons.
Obituaries.
From two years ago.
Well, it's a lovely tribute,
but that guy wasn't dead when they wrote it.
That's our John Doe.
So, you got a hit.
Yes.
Our John Doe's name is Roger Parsons.
Dan Walsh was last seen in Los Angeles
June 15, 2013.
Roger Parsons supposedly committed suicide
around that same time.
Obviously no body was recovered.
Because he wasn't dead.
It was a stunt.
He faked his own death, started over.
Well, that how it looks.
Do we know his connection with Walsh?
So far, there isn't one.
They didn't seem to know each other.
So, how did Roger become Dan?
And what made him fake his suicide in the first place?
I don't know.
Well, I flew you to L.A. to find out.
Oh, it wasn't for the breakfast burritos?
'Cause so far, that's all I like about this place.
No offense.
Burritos for breakfast?
This is so unfair.
I keep hearing this phrase -- "No worries."
What's wrong with it?
Well, I can't pin down the meaning.
Is it a social pleasantry, like "You're welcome"?
Maybe it's more like a blanket position, you know?
Like "No nukes."
I'll tell you what I can't do.
I cannot live in a state
where the flip-flop is the state shoe.
And what's with the drumming everywhere?
All I hear is drumming.
Well, probably because of the drum circles.
Uh, Kelly Parsons?
I'm detective Jane Rizzoli.
This is Dr. Maura Isles.
She's gonna be helping us with your brother's case.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You know, I stood right here two years ago,
convinced he'd jumped.
All this time, he wasn't dead.
I'm sorry. This -- this must be such a shock.
We had a funeral for him and everything.
Who fakes their death?
That's crazy, right?
I mean, even in Roger's world.
What do you mean, "In roger's world"?
Fast life.
The Hollywood scene, you know?
Then his girlfriend O.D.'ed,
And suicide made sense...
Even if they never found a body.
Do you think maybe there was a part of this fast life
that made him fake his death?
Well, he was obviously in too deep at the hotel,
so maybe he thought it was the only way out.
What hotel?
Where he worked.
For a guy named Alphonse.
We don't have any record of him at a hotel.
It wasn't that kind of job.
Okay, primer. What do you want us to know?
Yeah, all I know is cardiologist, patriots fan,
daughter Joann.
And I'm not telling you anything.
I want your unbiased opinion.
What, from him?
Would you pour?
Oh, there he is!
Ron Hanson.
Vince Korsak.
‭How you doing?
Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, come in and have a drink!
Hello.
I've heard a lot about you.
Likewise.
You two know each other?
What?
Nope.
The fact that you don't know each other is my fault.
I mean, this dinner is long overdue.
Wine?
Wine.
Declined?
You're sure?
Yeah.
I'm happy to spot you.
Yeah, Maura, that's not the point.
This is my last card.
I don't think this is a glitch.
I think somebody's got my information.
The fire.
Maybe your mail was compromised
when the building was evacuated.
Yeah, maybe.
It would explain all the weird phone calls.
You know what?
Nina's still at the office
going through the flight manifests.
I'll see if she can check it out.
Good idea.
I mean, whoever is doing this has access to my entire life,
and I can't even buy myself a drink,
which is very overpriced.
And, if I may, a little heavy on the vermouth.
Yeah, I'm not really a bartender.
I'm an actor.
I just do this so I can audition during the day.
This will cover you.
Not in this place.
Ask him. That's not gonna cover me here.
No.
Well, make it work.
I'm supposed to be a high roller.
Don't blow my cover.
Ooh, Mr. Franklin.
Good luck. Wait
no, no, no.
I need you for this part.
Oh, no.
I'd rather call it a night.
And I don't want my martini.
You don't have to have one.
Pull up a science journal on your phone.
Okay. I can do that.
I've got a critical study on hanging cases
I've been dying to read.
Fascinating. Put these on.
At night?
Yes.
Put those on, don't look up,
and don't talk to anyone, no matter what happens.
Psst.
Want to be an actor?
She's very important.
I can do an English accent,
and I can do a southern dialect,
And -- and, um, I can juggle.
Yeah, oh, good for you.
Quickly, could you tell me where I would find Alphonse?
Oh, you can't miss him.
There?
Thank you.
Well, whatever you need, it's on me.
Alphonse.
Darling.
Hey.
Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Good, good. How are you?
I'm good.
Good.
It's good to see you.
Last time I was in here, I had Marty with me.
We barely got a chance to talk.
Yes. Yeah.
Remember?
Oh, of course I do.
I'm so sorry.
You know what he's like before he has a movie that comes out.
Yes.
Listen, I was wondering if you could help me.
Um, Marty's gonna be in here tomorrow night,
but this time, he's bringing her.
And she is?
Still in rehab, according to the papers.
But you and I both know if we don't get her
a bottle of Vodka and an eight ball
we're both gonna lose our jobs, so...
the last time, I had Roger help me with this,
but I-I can't find him anywhere, so...
could you help me?
Please. Please. Please, please.
Of course I can.
Whatever you need.
Oh! Thank you!
Oh, you're welcome.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I was so hoping you would say that.
This is ridiculous.
You tricked me.
Yeah, well, I didn't think you'd talk to me
about a missing person who technically never worked here.
You were right.
But we know he did.
And we know that you buy off-book things
for people who are willing to pay,
So what was Roger's role?
She just won a Grammy.
Focus, Alphonse.
I have a few runners who pick things up for guests --
Women, pills, whatever they want, okay?
Roger ran the drugs.
Who's your dealer?
He's not my dealer, first of all.
Okay, one phone call, and this entire place gets raided.
You want to lose your liquor license tonight?
Because that pop princess over there
looks like she's about 12.
Dealer's name is Lamar.
Is Lamar the kind of guy
you'd fake your death to get away from?
I don't know.
I have these runners so I can stay out of it.
You got to do better than that.
Roger really lost it after his girlfriend O.D.'ed,
So maybe he said the wrong thing to Lamar...
or tried to get out of the game,
But we both know that's not how it works.
How do I find Lamar?
He's probably on speed dial of half the phones in this room.
It was awful, Vince.
I never sat through such an awkward dinner.
Yeah, Ron and Kiki were avoiding each other all night.
Like exes.
No.
Look, I'm no detective,
but I know when two people have history.
It would explain a lot.
Oh, it explains everything.
That's why they didn't say anything.
They didn't want it to be weird that the person I'm with
and the person you're with used to be...
With each other.
Then again...
Yeah, could be anything. No way to know.
Well, that's why we have to ask them.
We do?
Don't we?
Lamar St. John, 28 -- drug dealer to the stars.
So he makes a good living.
And he's well-connected, political.
He's untouchable, and he knows it.
Is that why he so readily agreed to come talk to us?
Nothing sticks to this guy.
We'll see about that.
How you been, Lamar?
I can't complain, though I can't stay long.
I'm opening up a new hookah bar in Westwood.
The traffic will get you.
Don't I know it.
The 405's a killer, even in a Bentley.
Hello.
New recruit?
This is Detective Rizzoli, Boston Homicide.
She wanted to talk to you about Roger Parsons.
I barely knew him.
You probably sold his girlfriend the drugs that killed her.
Oh, yeah?
She tell you that from beyond the grave?
Roger was a mess after she died.
Maybe you thought he was a liability.
So, what?
You think I pushed him off that pier?
No.
But I do think you're the type of person
who doesn't leave loose ends.
Roger didn't die that day.
But he is dead now.
How'd you guess?
And you're a Boston cop...
which means the murder happened there.
Oh, come on, mama.
Do I look like I got time to chase down some fool in Boston?
And if Roger faked his own death just to get me off his back,
it worked.
I haven't thought about that fool in two years.
And as long as he stays dead, I ain't got no issue with him.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really do have to get ahead of traffic.
I hate L.A. drug dealers more than I hate Boston drug dealers.
He's got a point, though.
Yeah, if this isn't about some old grudge catching up to Roger,
then we're not gonna solve it without connecting him to Dan Walsh.
Which we haven't done yet.
We will.
Hey, Nina. What's up?
It's not good news.
Your credit cards are just the tip of the iceberg.
You've been hacked.
Well, did they clean me out?
No, which is the weird part.
Your accounts haven't been overdrawn.
They were simply canceled.
Same with your bank account.
Canceled?
Doesn't somebody have to do that personally?
Someone with a way to verify identity
and answer your security questions.
This hacker is in deep.
O-okay, so, what do I do?
I'm sending you some documents to sign
in order to open up an official investigation.
And I'm working with the banks to trace the I.P. address
of whoever accessed your accounts
since your apartment fire.
Don't worry, Janie.
This is a high priority over here.
We're gonna find out who's behind it and shut it down.
Okay, thanks, guys.
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's all good.
So, Parsons did fake his death to escape his troubled life.
Yes. Which worked.
If Walsh's body hadn't have turned up,
Parsons would probably still be alive.
Right. So Parsons was killed
Because somebody knew that he was living as walsh.
And didn't want us to find out about it.
We're back to trying to find the connection between these guys.
Which brings me to the flight manifests.
Right.
We're looking at a passenger named Dustin Shaw.
He flew from L.A. To Boston and back
within one day of Roger's death,
and the address he states on his I.D.
is a post office box in venice, california.
Maybe the p.O. Box means he was homeless like Walsh.
There's something else you need to know about dustin shaw.
He's dead.
Nine months ago.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
According to the coroner's report.
So we've got another homeless man who's dead
Whose identity has been stolen.
Somebody killing homeless people?
Selling their identities?
Cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition,
So technically, he died of natural causes.
Well, technically, Parsons died of suicide.
We have to find the guy living as Dustin Shaw. Yeah.
We need to know what he looks like
Before we can put a bolo out on him.
I'm working with TSA to get airport security footage.
Okay, thanks. In the meantime, we'll go to venice.
Hey. Have you seen these two?
Excuse me.
Okay, thanks.
Seen either one of these two gentlemen here?
No, I haven't seen them.
Okay, thanks.
Excuse me. You recognize these two?
Have you seen either one of these guys?
Okay, thanks.
Sure
Excuse me.
Do you recognize these two?
Have you seen either one of these gentlemen?
One of these two?
Okay, thanks.
$1 a piece.
Do you recognize these two?
Should I?
Well, they were regulars
at the boardwalk shelter down the block.
Well, if that's true, then they were probably also regulars
at the sand dollar.
Is that a bar?
Yeah, all the bums go there.
The bartender cashes social security checks.
He'll even let you take a shower there sometimes.
All right, thanks.
Here.
On the house.
A souvenir of your trip.
It's that obvious I'm not from here, huh?
Most people aren't from here.
Even me.
But I can't leave.
I mean, who wouldn't want to call this home, huh?
I don't know that this place could ever feel like home to me.
Spoken like a woman who has family she actually likes.
Try to let it grow on you.
We aren't all weirdos here.
Thank you.
I-I don't know about him,
But I do recognize this guy.
He a customer?
No.
There was another guy who came in last week or so
asking about him.
He said to call if he came by.
You get a name?
Uh, I think he left his card.
How many years you say you've worked here?
Uh, two or three years.
Not exactly the American dream.
These guys have nowhere else to go.
I try to help them out.
Is that what they call it -- helping them out?
This is it.
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
How do you want to do this?
You want to question him together?
No, no, no. It's your turf.
You take the first crack.
You sure?
Yeah.
I mean, I'll file for extradition
as soon as I get home, but if he did both murders,
He's going down on both coasts.
Hey, Nina, what do you got?
Homeland security footage just came in
of the man traveling as Dustin Shaw.
No facial recognition yet,
But I just wanted you to see who you're looking for.
Okay, thanks. Let me know when you get a name.
We're in the wrong place. The bartender is dustin shaw.
Code 3 at 690 north venice boulevard.
Hands up. Everybody.
Come on. Get up.
Dustin Shaw.
L.A.P.D. Come out with your hands up.
He's shredding the evidence.
Well, he's trying to.
It's still on.
He was just here.
Move, move.
Move, move!
Move, move, move!
L.A.P.D. Move!
You okay? Don't move.
Both hands behind your back.
Uh...
Nice work.
Thanks. Is this a problem?
no.
Happens all the time.
On your knees. Let's go.
Really?
Oh, yeah. Our department is totally viral.
Okay, where I come from, this is a problem.
Come on.
Okay, wh--
This is a problem!
Okay? Hey!
This is -- this is a big pr--
You're a problem, you're a --
What are you doing?
Go! Go!
This is a problem!
All these I.D.s are names of regulars in the bar.
Yeah, people who probably wouldn't notice
If somebody opened a credit card in their name.
The guys we talked to said that the bartender,
A.K.A. Dustin Shaw, let them use the bar as a mailing address
So they had a place to receive their checks --
Disability, social security.
Well, I'll bet he enjoyed cashing them, too.
For a fee.
He skimmed thousands off these guys,
not to mention the money he made selling their I.D.s.
Well, it seems like a good side gig.
You know, Walsh must have caught on.
Some of the guys we talked to
said they'd had suspicions about the check-cashing,
but they're transients, addicts.
They didn't want to confront him.
Yeah, and lose what little they had.
Okay, well, what made Walsh different?
His hair.
His hair.
Our analysis revealed
a vitamin deficiency in the older growth.
Consistent with advanced alcoholism or substance abuse.
But the newer growth closer to the scalp --
the deficiency was not present.
So he got sober.
And he must have realized what Shaw was doing
and threatened to expose him,
and in or around that same time,
Parsons is in dire need of a fresh start,
so Shaw kills Walsh, sells his I.D. to Parsons,
and then everything's back to business as usual.
Until they found Walsh's body.
Right.
And Shaw knew that the body would lead to Parsons,
so he flew to Boston and took him out.
You two are like a regular Cagney and Lacey.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Well...
What?
It's factually inaccurate.
Cagney and Lacey were both police officers.
Dr. Isles is a... medical examiner.
Thank you.
It's been very nice working with you, detective.
You too.
Do you ladies think that you'll be back again soon?
When Malibu freezes over.
Malibu received .3 inches of snow in 2007.
It's not happening.
Okay, so, there's no point in dancing around the subject.
Vince and I asked you to come here
because we wanted to clear the air.
There is something the two of you aren't telling us.
You're right. There is.
And in most cases, I'm a big advocate
of confronting things head-on.
Good.
But in this particular case --
It's okay. They deserve to know.
Uh, Ron and I dated.
In the past.
I knew it.
Was it serious?
It was just one date, and it went...
Badly.
Uh, during the date, Ron was suddenly struck
with an extremely violent case of, um...
Acute gastroenteritis.
Isn't that...
Diarrhea.
I had diarrhea.
He was, uh, trapped in the bathroom the whole night,
and I felt it would be rude to leave him there,
though, in retrospect, with all I heard
I desperately wish I had.
That makes two of us.
You poor bastard.
I'm getting some drinks.
Oh, Ron. You poor guy.
I'll join you.
Okay, that's funny.
I am so sorry, Angela.
I just didn't want to embarrass anyone,
and I didn't want you to think differently of Ron
because of this story.
No, no, it's okay.
I'm just really glad to know he's human.
So, the bartender was not Dustin Shaw.
Right.
He was just living as Dustin Shaw.
His real name was Michael something.
So no one is who they say they are.
Welcome to Los Angeles.
Oh, come on.
It hasn't grown on you just a little bit?
God, no.
I've never wanted to see a duck boat so badly in all my life.
Well, I find it very relaxing.
My low back pain is completely gone.
Coincidence.
No.
You find it so hard to imagine yourself living here?
Hello.
Really?
You want to be attacked by a monkey in a bikini?
At least he's not wearing flip-flops.
I think it's a capuchin.
Hey! Welcome home.
And she has returned from the land of sun and sand.
And wine.
Indeed.
Very serious about their wine, those Californians.
Thank you.
Mm, enjoy.
Be glad you didn't have to go all the way there to get it.
You are not allowed to take a paid vacation to California
and then complain about it.
Do you want your souvenir or not?
Is it wine?
I want it if it's wine.
Mister Juicy?
Mm-hmm. If you ever wanted
to feel like you were in L.A., look no further.
Now cleanse.
Cleanse what?
Just...cleanse.
Jane.
There's something you need to see.
I traced the origin of the hack to your accounts
to a specific IP address.
It took me and three encryption experts
from the bank to do it.
When I zeroed in on the address,
it triped some machanism that redirected me
to an unindexed website
that you can't access without a password.
Can we crack it?
The password is Jane Rizzoli.
The web address contained a compressed video file
which I downloaded.
It's my apartment.
From before the fire.
Wait a minute. What is this?
It wasn't an accident.
Why send a video?
'Cause whoever set the fire...
Wants me to know about it.
