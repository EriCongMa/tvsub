jay ...
what ? !
what &apos;s wrong ?
you are snoring !
me ? oh , i &apos;m sorry .
look at her !
come on ! we said no stella in the bed .
oh but she &apos;s just a little puppy .
she probably get scared and snuck in .
oh really ? how come when manny have nightmares
you don &apos;t let him snuck in bed ?
gloria , it &apos;s six o &apos;clock in the morning ,
can we talk about this later ?
answer the question , jay .
you know , i &apos;m gonna check the lease ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re not allowed to have a meth lab .
you are a delight .
so what are you doing ?
i think you &apos;re gonna like this . i &apos;m going on a juice fast .
mmm . love it .
hate it . let &apos;s face it ,
a well @-@ fed cam is hardly a model of emotional stability .
now deprive him of food , and stage by stage ,
it &apos;s a slow descent into madness .
stage one--the clean sweep .
poison .
poison .
poison .
do you think that this is the best week to be doing this ?
why not ?
well , we have that charity thing at my boss &apos; house .
oh , so what ,
i &apos;m supposed to put off my quest for wellness
until we &apos;re no longer socially in demand ?
that will never happen . i &apos;m too charismatic .
no . no . not the cookies .
of course the cookies .
why do you always want me to fail ?
stage two--attack mitchell .
because when his diet crashes and burns
into a giant pile of nutella ,
i &apos;m the one he &apos;s gonna blame .
well , no , not this time .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna do the fast with you .
i think it &apos;s a great idea , and we should do it together .
so we &apos;re on the same team , you know , us versus food .
i know what you &apos;re doing ...
and i really appreciate it .
no , it &apos;ll-- it &apos;ll be good for me .
i &apos;ve actually put on a few pounds .
yeah , well , you know , i didn &apos;t want to say anything .
as the stock market plummeted ,
brave young men took to the skies ,
ushering in the golden age of the daredevil .
how awesome are people ?
so awesome .
you wanna get that , buddy ? i &apos;ll pause it .
hey , luke . how &apos;s it going ? i--
hey , uncle mitchell .
i really can &apos;t talk . i &apos;m trying to watch a movie .
oh , okay , well , i just wanted to drop off this bag of junk food .
go on .
uh , cam and i are on a juice fast ,
so having this stuff in the house--
i connected the dots . see ya .
seeing that weird , wonderful little man
pursuing his dream of walking on a tightrope made me think
maybe i could pursue my dream ...
here you go , buddy .
of walking on a tightrope .
come on , dad ! you got this ! you can do this !
stay focused ! stay hungry !
you okay , buddy ?
what ? yeah , hell , yeah , no .
just proud of my dad !
there was a lot of chocolate in that bag .
phil , honey , you gotta take luke to school .
got it .
okay , i haven &apos;t fallen three out of the last four times .
this afternoon , we go airborne .
sitting all by yourself at the table .
now where have i seen that again ?
oh , right . every day in the school cafeteria .
i do that by choice .
the school &apos;s choice .
isn &apos;t that your nickname ?
haley , be nice to your sister .
alex , good save .
mom , sign this .
what is it ?
they finally bumped me up to the harder math class .
third period , mr. waters .
what ? no , mom , you cannot sign this .
this is my class .
you &apos;re a freshman . what are you doing in second @-@ year math ?
you &apos;re a senior . what are you still doing in second year math ?
not &quot; still . &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
alex , be nice to your sister .
haley , not a good save .
i knew it would suck having you at my school .
well , hang in there .
a couple more years , you &apos;ll have it all to yourself again .
come on , girls .
jay , look at this .
it &apos;s ruined .
stella did this . she chew on my shoe !
you have to discipline that stupid dog .
i discipline her all the time .
oh , really ? how ? by buying her little cupcakes ?
they &apos;re not real cupcakes .
they &apos;re doggy treats in the form of cupcakes .
yeah , you should have told that to manny before he ate one .
oh , come on . his coat never looked better .
you wouldn &apos;t find it so funny if she was destroying your shoes .
well , i don &apos;t leave my shoes laying around , so ...
so it &apos;s my fault that she chooses to chew my shoe ?
i didn &apos;t say that . you barely said it .
you have to stop coddling her .
i don &apos;t coddle her .
what ?
she tries to drink the water .
it &apos;s funny .
you don &apos;t look at me in class . you don &apos;t text me .
who would text during a class ?
what are you ?
hon , i realize that this situation is not ideal
for either one of you ,
but sometimes we just rise above things . yes ?
excuse me . did you notice the curb here is painted yellow ?
uh , no , i did not .
wow . it means loading and unloading .
okay , well , i was just dropping off my kids .
and yet i see no kids emerging from the vehicle .
well , we were chatting .
at the risk of surprising you a third time , officer ,
i &apos;ve been dropping off here for years , and i--
move it .
okay . you betcha .
what was her problem ?
oh , you know what you should have said to her--
nothing . i should have said nothing would be the point .
i have to see her every day .
i mean , why make it worse ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
awkward , unpleasant situation--
rise above .
have a nice day .
love you !
bye @-@ bye !
&quot; and yet i see no children emerging from the vehicle . &quot;
how &apos;d you like to see my fist emerging into your face ?
oh ! now i think of it !
day four of the juice fast ,
and i &apos;m hungry , but i &apos;m-- i &apos;m feeling pretty good .
cam , on the other hand , has gone all ...
&quot; girl , interrupted . &quot;
after one , throwing out all of our food ,
and two , blaming me ,
he entered stage three-- soap actress .
i just wish my sister would put herself out there more .
she has so much to offer .
why are men so superficial ?
that was followed by stage four--
a rush of epiphanies ...
i ... don &apos;t ... need ... food .
look at this . architecture is everywhere .
oh . spaniards make amazing athletes .
into stage five--despair ...
daddy , we hided , but you didn &apos;t seek .
cam ?
then came rage .
hey . whatcha got there ?
the good news is ,
cam &apos;s never made it this far into a diet before , so ...
downside--i have no idea what the next stage is gonna be .
but i &apos;m pretty sure
it &apos;s not charming party guest .
cam , i @-@ i was thinking ,
i &apos;ll take the bullet tomorrow night at my boss &apos; house .
you don &apos;t have to go to the party .
they &apos;re--they &apos;re boring .
silly cause , you know , lots of people .
parking ...
cam , say something .
why do you hate me ?
i don &apos;t hate you .
then why are you trying to push me out of your life ?
because you--you seem a little ...
unhinged .
okay , well , you know what i think ?
you should worry a little bit less about me
and a little bit more about yourself
and what you &apos;re gonna wear tomorrow night ,
because i saw what you have laid out ,
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna like the way you look in photos .
well , i hadn &apos;t landed on that .
her hand &apos;s in the air , like , every five seconds ,
and she actually reminded mr. waters to assign homework .
the class loved that . do you know how embarrassed i was ?
not as embarrassed as i was
when she said 8 was a prime number . 8 , mom .
okay , fine . you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna call the school today and have your schedules changed ,
but i want you to know a little part of me died today , okay ?
i thought the two of you could understand
how being in the same class would benefit you both .
alex , you--you could &apos;ve tutored haley .
haley , you could &apos;ve helped alex with her social skills .
come on . the two of you could &apos;ve been two super dunphys .
and instead , what are you ? two bickering half @-@ dunphys ,
and i &apos;m the fool that expected more .
no , i don &apos;t even want to hear it . just go upstairs . go .
what was that ?
that was a master class in parenting .
right now our daughters are upstairs
making a decision they think is their own ,
but really , it was an idea that was skillfully implanted by me .
inception , claire .
dangerous game , but i like it .
what are those ?
wire walkers .
you want to go to the dance , you gotta wear the shoes .
luke , grab your camera .
luke .
i wasn &apos;t sleeping .
honey , i @-@ i think those are ...
jazz shoes .
no . tightrope shoes .
got &apos; em at an estate sale . only worn once .
that--that is not a ringing endorsement for ...
oh ! phil , honey .
please be ca--careful . right .
watch the door .
hey , what &apos;d you get for number 3 ?
you &apos;re not going to learn if i just give you answers .
well , what if i gave you something in return ?
like what ?
you can talk to me in class .
i want lunch at the cool table .
then i want all the answers .
then i want a week at the table .
that &apos;ll cost you two pop quizzes .
a month .
the midterm .
deal .
looking great , dad .
with these steps , i break the surly bonds ...
chicken in a basket !
don &apos;t look at me .
mom . mom . mom .
what ? what ? what ? what ? what ?
mom . mom . did you call the school yet ?
uh , not yet , but i was just about to .
uh , bartles &amp; jaymes !
good . because we are thinking
we might want to stay in that class .
really ? oh , girls , i don &apos;t know about that .
oh , please let us try it .
super dunphy ?
i can &apos;t hold her ! i can &apos;t hold her !
well , maybe one more week .
thanks , mom .
i don &apos;t know . uh , a cup of soup , a cobb salad .
yeah , it had bacon .
cam , i don &apos;t have all day to describe all my meals to you .
stop eating all my things , you stupid animal .
no , cam , not you .
i &apos;ll call you back .
bad doggy !
you want to chew on something ?
okay . okay . okay .
look at this .
look at this delicious man shoe . eat it .
come on . eat it . eat it .
mmm ! yummy .
eat the shoe .
eat his shoe . come on . eat his shoe .
yeah , like this . look .
delicious .
mom ?
drop it .
i--
please . i &apos;m sorry you had to see this .
hello ?
hi , mrs. dunphy . this is rose in the principal &apos;s office .
can you hold for principal weller ?
yes .
hi , claire .
hi , john . what &apos;d she do this time ?
actually , i &apos;ve got both of them in here .
both of them ? really ?
alex was letting haley copy her homework .
mr. waters caught them .
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe it .
i &apos;m about to have a little talk with them ,
so they &apos;ll be out a few minutes late .
um , i &apos;m so sorry , john , and honestly ,
i @-@ i really am a better mother than this . i promise .
so you &apos;ve said .
seriously ?
seriously ? oh . you ...
excuse me .
hey , um , what the hell is this ?
this zone is for loading and unloading ,
not for talking on the phone .
yeah , i know , but i was talking on the phone to the school
that my kids were about to come out of , so ...
are you aware this zone has a time limit ?
n @-@ no , i &apos;m not .
you know what ? i do want to do some unloading .
i know your type .
life has been bad to you . it has made you feel small .
and then one day somebody gives you a fake cop outfit ,
a toy badge and a little spongebob tie .
suddenly it &apos;s payback time , right ?
well , i got news for you ,
&quot; law &amp; order : special parking unit , &quot;
not my fault .
i &apos;m really sorry , dad .
oh , it &apos;s all right .
everybody throws up at school .
if i had a nickel for every time i puked at school ,
you know how much money i &apos;d have ?
35 cents .
exactly . now go get cleaned up , and i &apos;ll call the doctor .
wait , dad , i don &apos;t need a doctor .
what &apos;s up ?
the other day ,
uncle mitchell brought over a bag of junk food
so he and cam could do a jew fast .
juice fast ?
i &apos;m pretty sure he said &quot; jew . &quot;
but anyway , i took the bag , and i hid it , and i ate it all .
oh , buddy .
i couldn &apos;t help myself . i &apos;m weak . don &apos;t look at me .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay . hey , you learned a lesson .
a painful lesson .
i guess we both have .
what do you mean ?
i always saw myself as a guy
who could soar through the sky , dancing on a wire .
i can &apos;t even get across one 6 inches off the ground .
well , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
maybe you keep falling
because part of you knows that you can fall .
maybe if the wire was much , much higher , you wouldn &apos;t fall .
oh , luke , luke , luke .
you are a genius .
come on . we got work to do .
yes ! can i have a doughnut first ?
yes , you can !
ah , there they are , my super dunphys .
we &apos;re sorry , but we just--
you don &apos;t get to talk .
you had a chance to be better people today .
you , to be more well @-@ rounded ,
and you , to be a better student .
you could have elevated the dunphy name ,
but instead , you chose to tarnish it ,
so , congratulations , ladies ,
you brought this family to a new low .
mom , are you--
yeah . yeah , i am ,
and i would actually like to get these loosened up , if i might .
are we gonna have any more trouble ?
no , ma &apos;am .
oh , claire , do you need me to drive the girls ?
all good , janet . all good .
goat cheese risotto ball ?
no , thank you .
are you sure ? they &apos;re so good .
walk away .
it &apos;s tough enough to deal with cam when i &apos;m at full strength .
but i have been fasting just as long as he has ,
and i do not have the energy
to deal with a big , needy brisketcase--
brass--basketcase .
cam ! don &apos;t be mad at me ,
but i think that you really need to eat something .
what ?
you &apos;re supposed to be my support .
oh , away from me , temptress .
and i never thought i would call you that in a negative way .
i &apos;ve seen her do a lot of crazy stuff ,
but this is a whole new level .
is this a people cookie ?
you &apos;re good .
a definitive &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; would be appreciated .
those cupcakes did a number on me .
are you happy ?
you have reduced me to a person who eats a shoe .
gloria , sit .
you think this is funny ?
to talk to me like i am a dog ?
i &apos;m not talking to you like you &apos;re a dog .
i &apos;m just asking you to sit so we can get to the bottom of this .
okay , fine .
good girl .
come on . you set me up .
gloria , why are you acting so crazy ?
it &apos;s just a little dog .
it &apos;s not the little dog that is making me crazy .
it &apos;s you that is making me crazy .
me ?
yeah , you used to put me first .
you used to want me in that shower .
should i be here for this ?
no , manny . it &apos;s okay . i go . but i want you to know this .
where i come from , men cherish woman .
it goes wife , mistress , dog .
dog always at the bottom .
as you can imagine , i get asked to help ,
uh , with a lot of these environmental causes .
usually , i buy a ticket ,
uh , bid on shaquille o &apos;neal &apos;s big shoe ...
and , uh , come home .
but then , something happened .
i love paddle surfing .
and each time i &apos;d go out , i &apos;d see this one sea lion .
he &apos;d pop his head up . he &apos;d check me out .
i got so used to seeing him , i even named him--snorkels .
oh , god , i do not like where this is going .
so one day , i , uh , i go out and i see snorkels .
but he &apos;s doing this weird twisting thing in the water .
oh , god . oh , god . oh , god .
so i paddle over , and i see he &apos;s got a plastic grocery bag ,
wrapped around his neck and one of his fins .
and i freaked , tried to get it off with my paddle .
it didn &apos;t work , so i @-@ i jumped in ,
but he disappeared under the water . and , uh ...
don &apos;t say it . don &apos;t you dare say it .
and i never saw him again .
this is the saddest thing i &apos;ve ever--
mitchell , are you okay ?
of course i &apos;m not okay .
none of this is okay .
okay , well , you need to pull yourself together .
&apos;cause we &apos;re at your boss &apos; house .
he drowned , cam !
is he all right ?
yeah , yeah , i just think he needs a little air .
you know who else needed air ?
snorkels !
excuse me .
snorkels ? ! where are you , snorkels ? !
mitchell , get back here !
oh , snorkels !
mitchell , what is wrong with you ? !
what do you think is wrong with me ? i &apos;m starving !
well , if you &apos;re starving , then just eat something !
i can &apos;t eat something because then you &apos;ll get mad at me ,
and we &apos;re at my boss &apos; house !
i &apos;m not gonna get mad at you !
i appreciate what you &apos;re doing for me !
i &apos;m doing it for you .
oh , you don &apos;t have to do anything for me .
i love you just the way you are .
i love you just the way you are .
i got you !
okay . okay .
i got you , babe !
thank you .
i got you !
cam .
i got you !
i can walk . i can walk .
i think mitchell may just be a work friend .
i let down my mom and dad today , and ... worse than that ,
i let down my teacher .
it &apos;s all my fault .
everything i touch turns to detention .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
me , too .
oh , i don &apos;t really have
a whole lot of moral high ground to stand on .
i wasn &apos;t exactly my best self today either .
all in all , not a great day for the dunphys .
come on , dad ! believe in yourself !
you &apos;re making the impossible unimpossible .
phil . oh , my god .
don &apos;t even bother . he &apos;s in the zone .
he can &apos;t hear you .
go , dad !
you got this !
all week long , i &apos;d been telling my girls how to act
instead of showing them .
but not phil .
phil could have said ,
&quot; alex , relax . don &apos;t take everything so seriously . &quot;
or &quot; haley , challenge yourself . don &apos;t give up so easily . &quot;
but instead of talking the talk , phil walked the walk .
and isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re supposed to do
for the people we love ?
it &apos;s definitely a challenge ...
but phil made it look easy ,
7 feet off the ground .
you &apos;re awesome !
oh , my goodness !
turns out , i &apos;ve had my super dunphy all along .
oh , i know .
what was on my mind as i was walking across that wire ?
i kept thinking , if i can do this ,
then i &apos;ve got two ways of getting across my yard .
did you have fun ?
yes . she &apos;s the cutest dog in the whole world .
yeah , i heard you the first time .
let &apos;s go find your daddies .
we &apos;re in here !
oh , my god . these cupcakes a so good .
i &apos;m so sorry . we helped ourselves .
we were so hungry . they are delicious .
i love that they &apos;re not too sweet , you know ?
they taste almost like pate .
you know , i mean ...
but why are you eating ?
we &apos;ve been on a juice cleanse .
