agent rebecca stone , homeland security .
i &apos;ve been undercover
building a case against the graysons --
you &apos;ll wear this wire .
we &apos;ll watch your every move
until you get a confession from conrad .
i think pascal is talking to homeland security .
the only person he has to offer up is dad , right ?
pascal has been talking to the feds .
pascal ...
watch out !
i tried to warn him , but it was too late .
no , no !
who wrote this ?
i have a guess .
it can &apos;t be david clarke .
digital stamp from a local post office
and tracks to ...
a cabin in the middle of the berkshires .
so , this really is just some sicko trying to mess with me .
let &apos;s go before he comes home .
seized ...
confined ...
captive .
six years of my youth were spent that way .
no !
cooperate and you &apos;ll be fine .
in juvenile detention , many lost hope .
for me , being locked away was an impetus for revenge
帕斯卡 · 勒马尔查尔去世
and for the vow that once i got out ,
i would punish those who took my freedom .
did you get it ?
everything we need .
remember when i used to drag you here as a little boy
to go bird @-@ watching ?
you hated it .
i actually loved those times , mom .
well , enjoy their songs while you can , daniel .
they &apos;ll soon be taking off for warmer weather .
everyone leaves .
pascal didn &apos;t choose to go .
i still can &apos;t get the horror of last night out of my head .
conrad will pay for what he &apos;s done ,
as will emily thorne .
why do you think she was involved ?
just before he went with your father on the roof ,
pascal shared a look with emily ,
and it was as if she was ordering him there .
yeah , the homeland security agent
that pascal was working with was a woman .
a ghost whose number has been disconnected .
yeah , i &apos;ll look into it .
in the meantime , you need to get home ,
get some rest .
sleep can wait , daniel .
i have vermin to stalk .
thanks for meeting with me , detective .
my family and i are in shock and desperate for details .
i was hoping you could share your findings .
here &apos;s what i got -- uh , the two eyewitnesses ,
conrad grayson and the helicopter pilot ,
were questioned last night .
their accounts match .
mr. lemarchal stepped backwards ,
stumbled , and fell .
so you &apos;re ruling it an accident .
unless i learn something that suggests otherwise .
you know , we found an odd thing at the scene .
it was pretty curious , actually .
did you know your dad was wearing a wire ?
no .
i checked with other law @-@ enforcement agencies
to see if he was working with any of them .
he wasn &apos;t .
my father was known to tape business conversations
with those he found untrustworthy .
he did not trust conrad grayson .
then you think what i think --
there &apos;s more to this than we know .
emily . hey . this is my third message .
i need to show you something .
might be nothing , but just --
just in case , call me when you get this .
jack , right ?
javier . nolan &apos;s federal pen pal .
had me help you out on the phone a while back .
well , from what i hear ,
your friendship status is debatable .
anyway , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m looking for charlotte .
she hasn &apos;t answered any calls or texts since last night ,
so i traced her phone signal ,
and the last ping off the cell tower
originated from here , around 10 : 00 .
that was when her phone died and she left .
did she say anything --
where she was going , plans for today ?
i &apos;m gonna check in with some people .
i &apos;ll call you if i find out anything , okay ?
yeah .
thanks .
yeah . thank you .
未知号码
i have your daughter .
would you like to get her back ?
who is this ?
flight 197 destroyed many lives ,
so i &apos;m destroying yours .
to ensure charlotte &apos;s safe return ,
you and her mother
will confess your involvement in that terrorist act
and the subsequent framing of an innocent man .
do not alert the police or anyone else ,
or there will be consequences .
this is worse than i thought .
nice job on the voice @-@ altering program .
love the compliment ,
but what i need is reassurance
that what we are doing is not completely messed up .
with pascal dead , charlotte &apos;s all i have left .
she &apos;s the only person
that victoria and conrad would do anything for .
don &apos;t answer !
it &apos;s jack . he &apos;s called twice .
what if he &apos;s in trouble ?
no contact with anybody outside this group until this is over .
i couldn &apos;t get her to eat anything .
and are the cuffs really necessary ?
you don &apos;t kidnap somebody halfway , nolan .
i would never hurt charlotte , nolan .
if you don &apos;t trust me , there &apos;s the door .
look , i want you here ,
but if you stay , this plan doesn &apos;t end
until victoria and conrad are behind bars tonight .
so ?
so ...
let &apos;s bag some graysons .
第三季第二十一集
as predicted , conrad placed a call .
duke marino -- one of his thugs @-@ for @-@ hire .
i am hijacking the line ,
sending it to a dummy voicemail .
杜克 · 马里诺 虚拟线路
you have reached the mailbox of 555 @-@ 0183 .
leave a message .
mr. marino , this is conrad grayson .
meet me at wharf 16 in an hour .
right , then . off to the morgue .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
my father would want me to be strong .
i wrote his obituary this morning .
the time we shared here
allowed me to honor him as a daughter ,
not just his employee .
our last exchange was such a good one .
he told me he --
he loved me and was proud of my accomplishments .
hey , you &apos;re gonna get through this , okay ?
what are you watching ?
uh , well , the detective on the case
asked for all security footage from lemarchal headquarters .
i made a copy for myself .
why -- why would you do that ?
you think my dad killed pascal ?
yes .
i think he did , too .
it &apos;s no secret my dad was gunning for him on the business side ,
but as soon as pascal and my mother rekindled their relationship ,
tensions escalated .
to the point where my father was wearing a wire
the night he died .
he must have wanted to capture something incriminating on conrad .
and conrad must have found out .
and how is this for a coincidence ?
any camera with a clear view of the helipad
was out of order .
but look what i just discovered .
here is the stairwell from the roof
seconds after the accident .
i don &apos;t recognize her .
do you ?
not at all .
please -- don &apos;t come any closer .
call a televised press conference
for 6 : 00 p.m. at grayson manor .
do this , and charlotte goes free .
disobey me again ...
and more of what &apos;s in the box will arrive .
what are you doing ? !
please -- don &apos;t come any closer !
talk about a software suck @-@ it .
i fixed the bugs in javier &apos;s myclone app .
this may as well be charlotte grayson in the flesh .
no !
that &apos;s enough .
easy , judge judy .
you were the one that sent conrad an ear .
i mean , seriously , do you and aiden flip a coin
for who runs the creepiest errand ?
what &apos;s the first thing you think you &apos;ll do
as amanda clarke ?
i mean , you &apos;ve been running this race since you were a kid .
you haven &apos;t even fantasized about what happens
when you cross the finish line ?
you know what always stuck with me ?
that time that you implied i was a robot .
ems , we were in a fight . i didn &apos;t ...
emily thorne is a machine .
that &apos;s why i created her .
i had to find a way not to feel .
the truth is ...
i have no idea who amanda clarke is anymore .
did you hurt yourself , little mouse ?
i &apos;m the nanny . is he okay ?
oh , it &apos;s just a little scratch .
we all have to take our bumps and bruises ,
don &apos;t we , little carl ?
i was looking for jack .
oh , he &apos;s at work . can i give him a message ?
you &apos;re very kind .
but i was hoping to catch him in person .
stop !
246 passenger fatalities
in the bombing of the jumbo jet .
for too long , you &apos;ve heard the rumors
of conrad grayson &apos;s immoral acts
and then buried your head in the sand .
today , i &apos;m showing you the truth .
what ?
the bombing of flight 197 decimated my family .
did you ever wonder about the people who died that day ,
slaughtered by conrad grayson ?
he &apos;s a businessman ! he didn &apos;t put a bomb on a plane !
he laundered money for the terrorists who did .
he &apos;s just as guilty .
for the downing of flight 197,
all 246 americans on board that flight were killed .
kelly and patrick simmons .
uzarski family .
erin mayo .
brett and elizabeth richards .
i don &apos;t want to torture you .
i want to teach you .
charlotte , please -- open your eyes .
richard lucas .
derek wilson .
when exposure threatened your family &apos;s life of privilege ,
conrad turned to your mother to cover his tracks .
she chose david clarke ,
your father , to take the fall .
大卫 · 克拉克审判案
moments ago , a jury found terrorist conspirator david clarke
guilty on all counts .
but how many people would be needed
to pull off such a conspiracy ?
no !
how far would they go to frame an innocent man ?
federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge @-@ fund executive david clarke .
grayson put you up to this , didn &apos;t he ? !
grayson &apos;s testimony detailed the scheme clarke used
to channel money to the terrorists
高级行政层度假
responsible for the downing of flight 197 .
i have a family ,
and you &apos;re sending me to prison for a crime i didn &apos;t do !
and you know it !
no more !
who else would they eliminate to protect their plot ?
please stop !
check out that sunset .
no !
turn it off !
your parents &apos; crimes can &apos;t go unchecked any longer .
do you have the strength to call them out ?
what the hell are you doing ?
victoria .
murderer !
how dare you show your face here !
if you &apos;d answered my calls ,
you &apos;d know charlotte &apos;s been abducted !
they took her and sent me this !
now will you listen ?
a man contacted me this morning .
the bombing of 197 has destroyed his life .
he blames us and demands
that we tell the world what we &apos;ve done .
oh , my god . this is -- this can &apos;t be happening .
i &apos;m calling the authorities .
no , i already tested the boundaries .
this ... was the consequence .
we &apos;ll do as he instructed --
call a press conference and come clean .
charlotte ...
shouldn &apos;t perish for our sins .
our sins ?
i will do whatever this abductor wants ,
but be clear --
what &apos;s happening is a result of your deplorable ,
greedy actions 20 years ago .
if charlotte dies , this will be your fault .
if you need to lay blame , then keep in mind
that it was your romantic entanglement with david
that brought her into this world in the first place .
i showed her love when i didn &apos;t have to .
and though she was born of betrayal ,
i will not let her die that way .
you abducted charlotte to get the graysons to confess ?
how did you even find us ?
charlotte was missing .
i thought that i needed your help .
but then when you guys didn &apos;t answer my calls ,
i knew something was up ,
so i had her boyfriend track nolan &apos;s phone .
javier knows where we are ?
so what ? !
no one in their right mind
would think you guys are up to something this sick .
you need to leave .
why ?
so you don &apos;t have to confront your conscience ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna take care of that ... thing from home .
jack , i am so close to the end .
by tonight , victoria and conrad will be finished .
our father &apos;s name will be cleared .
what about charlotte ?
she can finally live in truth .
you will never have a relationship with your sister after this .
do you understand that ?
i need emily .
just emily .
what ?
she &apos;s having a panic attack .
well , it &apos;ll pass . i had them all the time when i was a kid .
just slow things down .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re the one who said that we can &apos;t do things halfway .
all i can see out there is colleen .
what happened to your sister was totally different .
she was kidnapped and used as leverage
to force my father to do something against his will .
she was terrorized , tortured , and killed .
that is not gonna happen to charlotte . you know that .
she doesn &apos;t .
we can &apos;t allow her to suffer .
fine . i &apos;ll go to the pharmacy .
i &apos;ll get something to calm her down .
take porter with you .
you kick me out ,
and i will blow the whistle on this whole thing .
i &apos;m not leaving charlotte .
where were you two heroes when i was 9 years old ,
being dragged out of my house by men with guns ,
thrown into the foster @-@ care system ?
charlotte has always been protected ,
and she will be fine now .
take charlotte &apos;s hair and carl &apos;s blood to the lab ,
and tell them it requires immediate attention .
and if they &apos;re busy ?
i &apos;ll pay whatever it takes . hurry , please .
a life depends on it .
emily thorne ?
yes ?
i &apos;m detective hosko , nypd .
i think you may have some information that could help us .
we &apos;re looking into the death of pascal lemarchal ,
actually , i didn &apos;t know mr. lemarchal very well at all .
how well do you know conrad grayson ?
he &apos;s my ex @-@ father @-@ in @-@ law .
i heard he was on the roof when mr. lemarchal died .
do you suspect foul play ?
is conrad in custody ?
we &apos;ll hash that out at the station .
actually , it &apos;s really not a good time for me right now .
i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t have much of a choice .
well , then ... i &apos;ll meet you in the city .
you know what ? there was a pileup on the l.i.e.
traffic &apos;s backed up for miles .
ride with me .
i &apos;ll light it up , get us there in no time .
security cameras captured this .
per the time stamp , this person witnessed mr. lemarchal
getting acquainted with that helicopter blade .
someone says it &apos;s you .
well , it isn &apos;t .
you were there , though .
well , in the building , yes .
the photographer hired to document that party
doesn &apos;t have a single shot of you .
why would that be ?
what ... you think i &apos;m involved in this ?
mind answering the question ?
he was probably instructed not to take my picture .
the graysons despise me .
really ? i heard you and mr. grayson were tight .
you two ever discuss the ax he had to grind with pascal ?
ems . hey .
detective hosko ...
i haven &apos;t talked to conrad in weeks .
ems ?
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m ... not more help .
that &apos;s nice of you .
i &apos;ll admit the longer i look at this case ,
the more questions i have .
for example , why was mr. lemarchal
wearing a wire when he died ?
and whose partial print did we find on it ?
that person &apos;s got to know something .
i would imagine so .
we &apos;re asking those associated with pascal
to , uh , volunteer elimination prints .
look , i know my rights . if you want them ,
you &apos;re gonna have to charge me with something .
you want a copy of her prints ,
just pull her juvie file .
my ex @-@ wife is a former delinquent , after all .
hang tight , ms. thorne .
what did you say to him ?
just that i knew my former bride &apos;s body when i saw it .
that &apos;s you in that stairwell .
no doubt .
poor daniel .
so bitter about our divorce .
always trying to stir up trouble for me .
you got it , babe .
the police have emily .
has she been arrested ?
no , but they &apos;re questioning her about pascal .
she sly @-@ dialed out on her phone so i could listen in .
they &apos;ve got the wire we used ,
and there &apos;s a partial print on it .
can &apos;t be one of ours .
i wiped the device down before i put it on him .
let &apos;s err on the side of caution , why don &apos;t we ?
especially since they &apos;re running the print
against emily &apos;s juvie record .
she switched those records with amanda when they swapped identities .
if emily &apos;s print happens to be on that wire ,
they &apos;re gonna come back belonging to a dead woman .
i am cyber @-@ stalling the cops &apos; search
while i hack the national database .
there &apos;s , um ... just one problem i can &apos;t fix .
daniel &apos;s at the station .
he got this whole ball rolling .
i &apos;ll get down there .
emily &apos;s been sidelined .
i &apos;m going to manhattan . you watch charlotte .
i &apos;m not helping you .
why are you here , jack ?
cause i care about the innocent person locked up in there .
you &apos;re not just here for charlotte .
you &apos;re worried about emily .
for her soul ... maybe .
you know , you .... you should know that , um ...
despite mine and emily &apos;s numerous attempts
at making it work , it ... it ...
it hasn &apos;t .
i have to let her go .
but you ... you obviously can &apos;t .
that &apos;s why you haven &apos;t rung the authorities already .
you still care about her .
but the problem is , you don &apos;t want her .
you want amanda clarke ,
that girl you cherished so long ago .
now , you will see that girl again ,
but only if this plan succeeds .
late @-@ breaking news ... conrad and victoria grayson
will make a major announcement in just a few hours .
we &apos;ll be live with the details .
money talks .
i &apos;ve composed our statements .
say what you want . i won &apos;t be there .
he clearly stipulated we both speak tonight .
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
about what ... saving your daughter &apos;s life ?
if charlotte was ever in danger at all .
i think you concocted this entire scenario
to trick me into incriminating myself .
would you put your contempt aside
and pay attention ?
i have crafted something
that protects both us and charlotte .
the confessions made during this dog @-@ and @-@ pony show
will be considered under duress
and inadmissible in a court of law .
the kidnapper &apos;s a fool not to have realized that .
and you are a fool to think
i &apos;d ever trust another word out of your vile mouth .
oh , come on .
hello ? !
you sent me those letters pretending to be david clarke ,
didn &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t want to get you in trouble .
i just want to talk .
you can trust me .
please ... talk to me .
put on the blindfold ...
now .
did i upset you ?
i didn &apos;t mean to .
please , just tell me what &apos;s going on !
i &apos;m letting you go .
i &apos;m at the station . how is it on your end ?
i am altering emily and amanda &apos;s fingerprints
so they lead to ... two dead @-@ end trails .
brilliant .
look , i can &apos;t hold off this detective &apos;s
database search much longer .
can you keep him occupied
for -- i don &apos;t know -- another five minutes ?
gladly .
i can &apos;t wait for those prints to come back as yours .
it &apos;ll support a little theory i have going
that you were part of a conspiracy to kill pascal .
the cops are gonna love it .
you sound just like your mother --
completely insane .
did you know impersonating a federal agent carries a penalty ?
come on ! let &apos;s go ! come on ! get off him !
you saw it !
that man attacked me completely unprovoked !
are you crying , daniel ?
no .
i &apos;m pressing charges .
easy . easy .
calm down , all right ?
all right .
thanks .
daniel ?
i spoke to detective hosko , who told me you were here .
how dare you take suspicions about emily to him
without telling me .
you used this investigation
to further a vendetta against your ex @-@ wife .
no , not a vendetta -- a hunch .
i think emily was working with my dad .
now , she may have posed as a department of homeland security agent
to get that wire on pascal and pascal up to that roof .
and why would conrad have emily do this ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why i wanted hosko to take a run at her .
fake agents , recording devices --
this goes far beyond business rivalries
or jealousy over victoria .
i didn &apos;t want you exposed to this .
i need answers , not protection .
even if it threatens the last memory of your father ?
your prints ...
... were not a match .
i &apos;m not surprised .
how about a ride home ?
i &apos;ll call a car .
emily , that ex @-@ husband of yours has it out for you .
thanks for the warning .
i wasn &apos;t giving you one .
i got decent instincts about people .
after watching you today ,
i &apos;m certain there &apos;s someone dangerous
hiding in that pretty , little socialite shell .
it &apos;s daniel grayson who should be worried .
i &apos;ll see you around .
even as a little girl ,
i preferred to call my father &quot; pascal . &quot;
he was so distant to me , it seemed right .
but now i wonder if i was keeping my distance from him .
perhaps i already sensed he was evil to his core .
how does one go on with life
knowing they &apos;ve descended from so much horror ?
by abandoning your soul .
is that what you &apos;ve done ?
oh , don &apos;t do what i &apos;ve done .
well , maybe i should .
if it makes dealing with these truths easier .
please don &apos;t .
why ?
because someday i may need you to save me .
the press conference is minutes away .
no word on what the former governor
and his ex @-@ wife plan to share ,
but when the graysons speak , the news is often explosive .
oh , my god .
charlotte ?
oh , my god !
how did you get here ?
we need to get you to a hospital .
charlotte --
your ear .
the naive deserve two things --
swindling and scorn .
that &apos;s what you always say , isn &apos;t it ?
how much do you hate me , then ?
because i &apos;ve been pretty damn naive until now .
you &apos;re to blame for flight 197 .
you laundered money for americon
and then arranged a cover @-@ up by framing david clarke .
you even silenced amanda .
you were behind all of it .
can you look me in the eye and tell me i &apos;m wrong ?
fine .
if you don &apos;t have the guts
to admit what you did to my real father ,
i &apos;ll tell the police .
you disgust me .
and you , my dear , are an ungrateful bastard .
my love for you was so profound
that i was gonna confess to everything
to save your life .
you know what ? no longer .
no . and you &apos;re not going anywhere .
you have no power over me !
no , i have the power to take you out anytime i want !
i had the reach to snuff out your nuisance of a sister .
i was in league with a confederacy of global terrorists
who tried to bring me down , but i &apos;m still here .
and your father , the selfish and dim @-@ witted david clarke --
he was my patsy to freedom .
oh , i have the power .
and my secrets are gonna rot inside of you
beyond your last breath ,
because you are gonna keep
our stupid and thankless mouth shut !
i &apos;m the last man standing for a reason .
and if you even think about crossing me ,
i will erase you as i have so many others .
are we on the air ?
now ...
we are broadcasting .
i have a press conference to cancel .
cut charlotte &apos;s camera .
turn on the tv in grayson manor .
if you even think of crossing me ,
i will erase you as i have so many others .
now ...
i have a press conference to cancel .
no word on how our signal was co @-@ opted ,
but it seems the transmission you just saw was live
from inside the grayson house --
shocking footage shows
conrad grayson confessing to a host of illegal activities ,
including terrorism , conspiracy , perjury , and murder .
our legal analyst is standing by to share with us
the ramifications of these bombshells .
ems .
you got him .
the authorities will be arriving any minute .
i won &apos;t waste my energy throwing you out .
though i am surprised
that you haven &apos;t gassed up a gulfstream and gone on the lam .
oh , running would be undignified .
particularly after suffering the humiliation
of being sold out by your very own daughter .
oh , that mis @-@ born wretch is yours alone .
though i gather she was an unwitting participant .
charlotte was as surprised as i to discover we were being broadcast .
given you bowed out of the press conference at the 11th hour ,
i &apos;m guessing you knew i was walking into a trap .
question is ...
did you set it ?
well , there will be many conversations where i &apos;m going ,
and do not think that i won &apos;t pull each skeleton from your closet
for the feds to pick over everything --
i mean , from killing helen crowley
all the way through to being my number @-@ one co @-@ conspirator .
prove it .
well , as usual ...
... i &apos;ll have others do that for me .
goodbye , conrad .
do rot in hell .
sorry i didn &apos;t bail you out sooner .
well , you were busy .
how are you feeling ?
you know , i never expected to
have a relationship with charlotte after this .
well , if you &apos;re not gonna revel in your victory ,
i wish you would at least acknowledge it .
conrad was defeated .
revenge is yours .
oh , the war is not over .
there &apos;s still victoria .
let her be tomorrow &apos;s problem .
tonight you should focus on something else .
you and i , we &apos;ve ...
we &apos;ve called it quits so many times .
but we haven &apos;t been able to make that stick , really , have we ?
and that &apos;s because we fit .
we belong together .
i know .
i need emily .
just emily .
he told me you two were ...
... you were done .
oh it &apos;s complicated .
no surpirse there .
you know what , it &apos;s , it &apos;s none of my business .
it &apos;s good to know that everything else ...
everything else turned out .
thanks for stepping in for aiden .
when he asked me to set charlotte free , i
i didn &apos;t understand how i could possibly be
the key to taking down conrad .
armed with the facts i knew that she would confront him
and get a confession that would hold up in court .
you were that sure ?
charlotte &apos;s a smart girl .
she &apos;s got a lot of fight in her .
we are blood , after all .
so you didn &apos;t really ...
need that press conference ?
no , i just needed those satellite trucks outside the house .
did you get to watch any of it ?
emily , that &apos;s not -- that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;ve been trying to tell you something since yesterday .
charlotte received letters
from somebody pretending to be david carke .
she and i tracked him to his house .
there was no one there , but it was like a shrine to your father .
i wrote him off as an obsessed nut , until ...
didn &apos;t your father have something like this when we were kids ?
i only remember it because
there was a time that we were on the beach
and -- and you dropped it ,
and you made me sift through 60 tons of sand until it turned up .
emily ?
an intention fueled by passion can be impossible to stop .
this was my father &apos;s .
over time , it gains momentum ,
until it turns into an impetus for change .
how is charlotte ?
not good .
hating dad .
she &apos;s mad at you , too .
believes you &apos;re as guilty as he is .
then she must never know that i refused the ransom demands .
what are you saying ?
that the kidnapper wanted me to confess alongside conrad .
but i acquired information today that made me certain
that charlotte would never be harmed .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
you took a gamble on your own daughter &apos;s life ?
have you lost it ?
oh , i &apos;m very much in my right mind about many things .
including emily thorne .
this is how a notion transforms into motivation ...
... and how a child &apos;s vow becomes reality .
you did this .
yes .
in memory of david and amanda clarke .
what about victoria ?
oh , i &apos;m not finished yet .
well , then , godspeed .
