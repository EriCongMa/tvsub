howard &apos;s capsule should be reentering
the atmosphere any minute .
it &apos;ll be good to have him back .
the fantastic four reunited !
yeah , you had a good run , fake wolowitz .
we &apos;ll remember you with nostalgic fondness .
the way we do the dial @-@ up modem , the vhs tape , or ...
or leonard &apos;s gym membership .
we &apos;re not kicking him out .
stuart and i have become good friends .
okay , one vote for , one vote against .
leonard , you &apos;re the tiebreaker .
i don &apos;t have a problem with stuart .
besides , he gives us a 20 % discount at his comic book store .
well , i don &apos;t sell my friendship that cheaply .
i can go 30 .
welcome aboard , old chum .
okay , the nasa website says
howard &apos;s final descent has begun .
he left a boy ,
he returns a boy @-@ sized hero .
loops , calm down !
baruch ata adonoy ,
eloheinu melech ha @-@ olam ,

曼德尔
waiting for my husband .

tonight , you belong to me .
gesundheit . you okay ?
i am now that you &apos;re back .
come on , let &apos;s go home
so i can tear off those little pants .
great . just keep in mind
astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space ,
so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting .
you know , i am very disappointed
that i won &apos;t be able to celebrate
howard &apos;s accomplishment tonight .
me , too . but we &apos;ll see him tomorrow .
yes , it &apos;s just that in all the years i &apos;ve known him ,
he &apos;s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration .
i was excited to see the look on his face
when it finally happened .
you &apos;re unbelievable .
i know .
all right , pictionary--
what are the teams ?
how about boys versus girls ?
oh ! that hardly seems fair .
but i guess any team that i &apos;m not on
has a decided disadvantage .
once again , unbelievable .
yeah , once again , i know .
all right , round one .
here .
got it .
okay .
ready , set , go .
uh , box ?
uh , window ?
batman .
batman and robin .
uh , wonder twins plus the monkey .
wonder twins plus the monkey and batman .
a gift ? present !
present ! yeah !
oh ... leonard .
now , how can you not get that ?
in what universe is that a present ?
it &apos;s not a present ,
it &apos;s the present . look .
there &apos;s you and me .
it &apos;s penny and amy .
we &apos;re playing pictionary .
in the present .
oh , my god , we &apos;re gonna kill them .
it &apos;s a quark @-@ gluon plasma .
no .
it &apos;s asymptotically free partons
inside a quark @-@ gluon plasma .
nothing with quarks .
it &apos;s an observational rebuttal
of the lambda @-@ cdm model of the universe !
no !
it &apos;s a chocolate chip cookie !
yes !
how could you miss that ?
hey , if you want someone to guess &quot; chocolate chip cookie , &quot;
you draw a glass of milk next to it .
penny got it .
yeah , only after
i eliminated all the obvious answers .
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , uh , uh , uh , sausage .
uh , uh , uh , uh , bratwurst ?
oh , oh , a hot dog .
penny , aren &apos;t you gonna draw something ?
relax , we got time , this is so fun .
there .
a solar system .
uh , uh , uh ,
uh , um , unidentified flying liverwurst ? i don &apos;t ...
now ?
soon .
come on , leonard ,
i am spoon @-@ feeding this to you .
i don &apos;t know , uh ...
casper the alcoholic ghost ?
all right , that &apos;s enough .
uh , hand .
uh , nail ... polish ?
yep !
wait , no , no !
the word is &quot; polish . &quot;
see , look . polish sausage .
and the @-@ the model of the solar system developed
by nicolaus copernicus , a polish astronomer .
and then , finally ,
if that wasn &apos;t enough-- which it should &apos;ve been--
this is madame curie killing herself
by discovering radium , who ,
although she was a naturalized french citizen ,
was polish by birth !
excuse me , the word is &quot; polish . &quot;
see ? small &quot; p . &quot;
so it is .
i guess we both share blame on this one .
bernie , you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
did you get a sea lion while i was gone ?
it &apos;s just allergies .
okay .
took some benadryl . i &apos;ll be fine .
so ...
did you miss me ?
are you kidding ? every minute of every ...
excuse me .
sweetie , we don &apos;t have to do this now .
yes , we do .
you left right after we got married .
this is like our honeymoon .
now ,
hold on to your hat .
you okay ?
a little dizzy .
must be the benadryl .
switch places with me .
okay .
now ...
... kiss me !
bernadette ?
bernie ? bernie ?
that was amazing .
you made me feel things i never ...
well , that was quick and a little gross .
now , i know how she feels .
hey , sheldon , you &apos;re always
full of fun little facts .
where did the expression
&quot; got your ass handed to you &quot; come from ?
don &apos;t know .
i wonder if it &apos;s from , like , ancient rome
where they &apos;d actually chop somebody &apos;s ass off
and then go , &quot; here . &quot;
you know , to appease loseroneous , the god of losers .
i am not a loser .
pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill .
mmm , in all fairness ,
pictionary has verbal skills , visual skills .
it &apos;s a pretty well @-@ rounded game .
lot of big talk from a man
who can &apos;t draw a chocolate chip cookie .
all right , fine , pick another game .
amy and i will beat you at anything .
all right .
let &apos;s play ...
physics fiesta .
oh , come on , what is that ?
it &apos;s a game that i just invented ,
in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial spanish .
donde esta el boson de higgs ?
en el acelerador de particulares .
bueno , mi amigo .
no , no , we &apos;re not playing some dumb made @-@ up game .
all games are made up .
they &apos;re not found in nature .
you don &apos;t just dig in the ground , come across
a rich vein of rock &apos;em sock &apos;em robots .
just pick another game .
why don &apos;t we do something athletic
like go over to the university pool and play water polo ?
no good-- sheldon doesn &apos;t float .
that is true .
i have a higher than normal body density .
if i run too deep a bath , i drown .
all right , let &apos;s keep it simple .
how about darts ?
oh , that &apos;s not fair either .
why not ?
darts is a bar game .
you &apos;ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age .
yeah , that &apos;s when it started .
well , regardless , she has a distinct advantage
in all tavern- based competitions .
pool , beer pong , wet t @-@ shirt contests--
they &apos;re all out .
由男士来评判哪位身材最佳
okay .
just for the record ,
i have never entered a wet t @-@ shirt contest .
i &apos;ve won a few , but that &apos;s just because i spill when i &apos;m drunk ,
so ...
we could go to the cadaver lab at ucla
and play real @-@ life operation .
no .
i don &apos;t think so .
are you sure ? i mean , the nose doesn &apos;t light up ,
犯错时病人鼻子会发红光 并全身震动
but if the corpse is fresh enough ,
sometimes you can get the leg to jerk .
hey , ma , twinkle , twinkle ,
your little star is home !
ma , the chain &apos;s on the door !
howard ?
i thought i wasn &apos;t going to see you till tomorrow !
yeah , well , bernie &apos;s not feeling well ,
so i thought i &apos;d stop by ,
tell you about the greatest adventure of my life ,
see if you can make me feel bad about it .
uh , uh , okay , hold on , i &apos;m not decent !
all right .
woman hasn &apos;t tied her robe in 20 years .
suddenly she &apos;s not decent ?
you want me to hide in the closet or go out the back ? !
shh , you need to whisper .
ma , who is in there ?
uh , nobody ! the tv is on !
i only got one sock .
where &apos;s my other sock ?
who is that ?
i told you , it &apos;s the tv .
jay leno lost a sock ; it &apos;s hilarious .
if you &apos;re busy , i can come back .
just give me a second !
go , go , go , go .
dr. schneider ?
oh , hello , howard .

找出主角沃尔多

and a red striped shirt .
i know what he looks like .
oh , there he is , i got him .
yes , we win again !
how could you not find him ?
because he &apos;s hard to find .
if he was easy to find ,
the books would be called there &apos;s waldo .
57 , 58 , 59,

long division , long division .
go , go , go .

amy , penny , both of you , stop it .
one to beam aboard ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re back .
oh , look at you .
you , you look like you grew .
yeah .
the lack of gravity did decompress my spine ,
so i &apos;m like an inch and a half taller .
i &apos;m going to the dmv tomorrow to get my license changed
before i shrink back .
oh , uh , come in , come in .
oh , i , uh , i didn &apos;t think i was going to get
to see you until tomorrow .

and my mom &apos;s kind of under my dentist .
wait , your , your mother is sleeping with your dentist ?
former dentist .
i need a new one now that i know where his hands have been .
so you &apos;re wandering all around by yourself ?
that &apos;s not the kind of hero &apos;s welcome
an astronaut should come home to .
it &apos;s okay , you know , we space cowboys
don &apos;t do what we do for glory and fame .
we leave that to your rock stars and your athletes
and your howie mandels .
oh , hey , man , welcome back .
oh , stuart , thanks .
what are you doing here ?
i , i kind of live here now .
just until he gets back on his feet ,
which are looking pretty good
in the boots i bought him for his birthday .
ah , he &apos;s spoiling me and i love it .
wow , so you guys are like buds now ?
oh , yeah , we hang out all the time .
plus , he doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ,
i don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
it &apos;s like we both had these holes in our lives ,
but now we fill each other &apos;s holes .
that sounds a little funny to an american ear .
which part ?
just all of it .
okay , so w @-@ what do you guys got going on tonight ?
raj is taking me to the sound of music sing @-@ along .
sound of music sing @-@ along ?
