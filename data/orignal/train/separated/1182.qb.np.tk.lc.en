is that for a club ?
not a club so much as a party .
i used to see your friend there .
maya ?
there &apos;s no more &quot; a , &quot; so why are you lying to me now ?
more silence . i &apos;m done , hanna .
you were friends of ali &apos;s .
me too . i &apos;m cece .
come in and meet ... my mother .
hello .
the board has decided to delay any decision to transfer mona .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you to explain anything
because you won &apos;t . i &apos;ll find out for myself .
tell your mom we need you to come in for a blood sample .
my blood is not on your evidence .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ted was a pastor ?
you really like him !
there can be real @-@ world compensations in your ending this .
do you mind if we try and break into maya &apos;s site ?
we have to .
i heard that caleb was back from california .
i could ask him for
some tips on how to get around a tough password .
go ahead .
at least one of us might be able to be in the same room as him .
we &apos;re in .
okay , i understand you &apos;re really upset right now ,
but can you please just look at this ?
it &apos;s a photo of maya .
yeah , i saw it .
i found it on her website last night , spence .
look . there is a stamp on her wrist
that matches the one emily remembers from that night .
holden really did see her there .
yep .
why are you not all go @-@ go @-@ gadget about this ?
this is big ! this is a real link between maya and that night .
look !
aria , i can &apos;t do this anymore , okay ?
i cannot keep running around looking for clues ,
i can &apos;t spend hours hacking into websites .
five days ago i literally forgot to apply to college .
do you get that ?
thanks .
thanks .
first i drive toby out of town , and now this .
hey , it was just the early admissions deadline .
you can still get in .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
upenn has been my dream school since i was eight , aria ,
and yesterday i found my dream crumpled up in the bottom of a bag
underneath my a.p. french and my physics homework .
which , by the way , i got a &quot; b &quot; on . &quot; b. &quot;
so no , everything is not gonna be okay !
i &apos;m dropping my velma act .
from now on , i &apos;m daphne .
because i have got a boyfriend to get back ,
and i have a college to get into .
i think you &apos;re confusing
which scooby @-@ doo character would have gotten into an ivy league .
and both velma and daphne solve crime .
morning , ladies . this belong to one of you ?
yeah , that &apos;s mine . thanks .
sure . upenn . who &apos;s applying ?
not me , &apos; cause i &apos;m going to community college .
she just missed the early admissions deadline .
hey , you don &apos;t need early admissions . you &apos;re a hastings .
if i can get in , you can get in .
you went to upenn ?
okay , dial down the shock .
no . no , it &apos;s just that if you went ,
then maybe you know somebody that i can talk to about my application ,
like a dean or a professor-- a janitor , even .
well , there is this party tonight ,
some people i haven &apos;t seen since high school ,
this guy steven is supposed to be there .
last i heard , he got a job
working for admissions after he graduated .
at upenn ?
yeah .
that is great . that is awesome !
can we please go talk to him ?
i could just bring my application--
i really wasn &apos;t planning on going . it &apos;s not really my scene .
oh . you &apos;re not gonna stop staring at me
like a lost puppy until i say yes , are you ?
fine . we &apos;ll go .
meet me at seven outside the boutique .
thank you so much .
okay . bye , lovely .
thank you !
bye .
well , look who just got their wish , cinderella .
you &apos;re gonna come too , right ?
hmm . negative .
i have gotta go talk to ezra after school .
sorry to bother you this early , mrs. marin .
&quot; mrs. marin . &quot; that doesn &apos;t sound good .
is hanna home ?
she &apos;s getting ready for school . what &apos;s going on ?
the judge signed the court order .
the department now has the legal authority
to compel hanna to provide a blood sample .
barry--
the sample will be tested
to see if it &apos;s a match with blood found on an anklet
belonging to alison dilaurentis .
lower your voice .
hanna has five days to comply , mrs. marin .
you know how to reach us .
mom , did you see my hairbrush ?
check the bottom drawer .
good morning , hastings &amp; reibman .
i need to speak to veronica hastings right away .
hey .
have you seen spencer ?
no .
sorry .
can you give her this when you do ?
it &apos;s the new log @-@ in for maya &apos;s website .
how &apos;s your mom doing ?
better .
how are you ?
i &apos;m fine .
good .
thanks for passing that along .
okay .
&quot; the apple rose grille at closing time .
go alone or caleb pays . - a. &quot;
what &apos;s at the grille ?
i don &apos;t know-- a &apos;s takeout ?
when did you get this ?
this morning .
i talked to caleb for the two seconds and then bam ! the text .
do you think it was because of mona ?
&quot; a &quot; probably knows i &apos;m the one who made her stay at radley .
has wren said anything about how she &apos;s doing ?
oh-- i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t talked to him since then .
you can &apos;t go . it &apos;s not safe .
spencer , if it were toby being threatened--
then i would hope that you would tell me the same thing .
look , i &apos;ve already lost one person this week ,
and when toby come back to rosewood ,
if he comes back , i &apos;m just pray that it is in one piece , okay ?
so please promise me that you will not go .
okay . i promise .
i haven &apos;t seen her smile like that since maya .
so i take it we &apos;re still not gonna tell her about
getting into maya &apos;s website .
she deserves a moment of happiness
before we drag her down the maya wormhole .
aria thinks it &apos;s a sign that
we didn &apos;t get hold of her that night ,
like the universe just wants her to be happy .
the universe is a finicky little bastard .
hi , paige .
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
uh , it &apos;s ... good .
yeah . it &apos;s great .
great .
um , okay . see you later .
you can &apos;t pretend this isn &apos;t happening !
no , but i can kick you out of my apartment .
it &apos;s great that you have principles ,
but you &apos;re only hurting yourself .
i &apos;m serious . get out .
dude , don &apos;t be an idiot . take the offer !
i &apos;m not gonna--
you aria ?
not now , wes .
dude , introduce me .
dude , keep walking .
and that was ?
that &apos;s wesley . my brother .
what offer was he talking about ?
nothing .
ezra , i could hear you two yelling from the stairwell .
clearly you &apos;re upset
i meant it .
it &apos;s nothing you need to worry about .
how much money is your mom gonna pay you to break up with me ?
why would you ask that ?
because she offered it to me first .
the other day at the museum
my mother offered you money to break up with me ?
that &apos;s what i came here to tell you .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just ...
processing .
well , can you please process out loud ?
why was your brother here ?
he came to help buy back the car i sold .
why ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i can keep up , ezra .
technically , the jag wasn &apos;t mine to sell .
my grandfather left it to me ,
but because i disowned my inheritance ,
it defaulted to my brother .
about a month ago i needed money ,
so i called wes and he said i could sell the car
and keep the cash .
okay , so ... ?
so ...
my mother found out ,
and she &apos;s now claiming it &apos;s a sentimental family heirloom .
oh , yeah , &apos; cause she is just so sentimental .
i have to buy the car back ,
and now the guy is asking for double .
which means i have to borrow ... from her .
i have to meet somebody about the car .
right now ?
yeah .
okay--
han ? hey , wait up .
hey . where &apos;s paige ?
headed home . we &apos;re gonna meet up later .
look , i know you &apos;re not telling me something .
i haven &apos;t heard an update about maya &apos;s website in a few days .
if it even is maya &apos;s .
i mean , we always knew that mona might be playing a trick ,
and if that &apos;s what you guys aren &apos;t telling me--
this isn &apos;t a trick .
then what is it ? do you know ?
caleb found a way around the password .
it &apos;s this site where maya kept stuff .
photos , blog entries , videos--
videos of what ? of maya ?
and one she took of you .
how long have you--
a few days .
and you kept it from me ?
she was my girlfriend . how could you keep this from me ?
because we saw how happy you were with paige ,
and we couldn &apos;t bring ourselves to ruin that .
come on , em , at least one of us deserves to be happy .
look , i know you &apos;re trying to protect me ,
but it &apos;s not up to you .
i don &apos;t appreciate being lied to .
you &apos;re right , and ... i &apos;m sorry .
here &apos;s the log @-@ in info for maya &apos;s website .
i can look at it with you , if you want .
no . i ... want to do it on my own .
ashley .
so , what brings you to my neck of the woods ?
just a few errands .
maybe we could grab coffee sometime .
i should get going .
we should . coffee would be great .
okay .
okay .
well , it was nice seeing you .
you too .
bye .
he basically kicked me out .
he did not kick you out , okay ?
he had someplace to go .
i &apos;m kind of lying here despondently right now , spence .
well , can you just sit despondently ? i need the bed .
no . lying is more despondent .
please ?
okay , fine .
show me options .
okay .
gray ... or blue ?
definitely neither .
these are my most collegiate @-@ looking blazers .
you did not just say that .
spencer , you &apos;re going to meet this upenn guy
at a party on a friday night , okay ?
so i really don &apos;t think that the attire is business formal .
did i mention how happy i am that you &apos;re coming with me ?
you mean you don &apos;t want to go alone
to some random party with a 22 @-@ year @-@ old stranger ?
she is not a stranger .
she is ali &apos;s older , gorgeous ,
very well @-@ connected friend that ...
somehow we never knew anything about .
yeah . ali would have dangled her
in front of us like a pair of diamond earrings .
why didn &apos;t she ?
i don &apos;t know .
is that your mother &apos;s ?
no !
maybe .
help !
please .
perfect . you can wear this .
you and ezra are gonna be fine .
i promise .
if you say so .
his family is--
look , i get it , okay ?
my nanna once offered me $ 200
to shave my father &apos;s sideburns in his sleep
because apparently they were &quot; an affront to his upbringing . &quot;
and he still has a scar really close to his ear .
you actually did it ?
i was ten !
that was like a million dollars back then !
are you kidding ?
oh , my god .
i &apos;d do it again .
so they &apos;re coming back to a party at rosewood ?
you never know what you &apos;re gonna get .
people either love you
or they don &apos;t remember your name .
look at jason--
he won &apos;t return my phone calls , and we dated for how long ?
jason &apos;s just going through a really rough time right now .
apparently .
wait . i &apos;ve been here before .
we both have . this is noel kahn &apos;s cabin .
yeah , eric does have a little brother , doesn &apos;t he ?
tell me , does douchebaggery run in the family ?
is noel gonna be here ?
i &apos;m betting he doesn &apos;t think we are .
something wrong ?
no . nothing . just ... weird history with noel .
what kind of weird history ?
they used to date .
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it--
it ended really badly .
oh , so it does run in the family .
listen , i understand the hex of the ex , believe me .
but noel &apos;s gonna be one of two hundred people at this party ,
if he even shows .
and we drove all this way ,
so i say we go in , find steven and give him your application ,
and if it &apos;s totally awkward we can bail , okay ?
cece drake .
and i brought friends .
stamp me .
thanks .
hello , everyone .
i cannot believe this is where the stamp was from .
yeah . everybody here is eric &apos;s age .
what would maya be doing with this crowd ?
yeah .
who was that guy with the stamp at the
diner the night that ali &apos;s grave was dug up ?
oh , my god .
maybe i should have brought two .
maybe you should have just left it in the car .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , but ... hello ?
i know .
ladies .
did you find steven ?
hon , you gotta meet the
guy before we shove your stuff in his face .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll get it where it needs to go .
game room . follow me .
this one &apos;s called &quot; that night . &quot;
dire moments , last good @-@ byes ,
your kisses dance like fireflies ,
i &apos;m gone tonight to a dark unseen .
a wish to take your light with me .
you were my first , but it won &apos;t be our last .
time travels till it &apos;s in the past .
you &apos;d think our love was some thickening plot ...
... they don &apos;t know that it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
looks like eric kahn &apos;s still playing truth or dare .
okay , it &apos;s official , you were right about the blazers .
cece drake ...
back from the dead .
how the hell are you ?
worse , now that i &apos;m seeing you , eric . but thanks for asking .
that &apos;s no way to treat the host .
but you &apos;ve brought a virgin sacrifice ,
so all is forgiven .
these are my ducklings , so play nice .
you &apos;re mean when you &apos;re cute .
only rule of the game room is you gotta play to stay .
other than that , dad &apos;s finest is right here .
help yourself .
doesn &apos;t look like steven &apos;s here yet .
don &apos;t worry , he will be .
relax , take a load off .
can i make you a drink ?
uh , no , thank you .
no one &apos;s gonna narc on you .
i &apos;ve seen cops do way worse in this room .
yeah . still no .
oh . girl in bra , boy in boxers .
did we skip truth and head straight to dare , or ... ?
stephanie was warm , alex was being alex .
well , in that case , i challenge you to a round of truth .
all right , cece . we &apos;re playing one @-@ on @-@ one truth rounds .
you get caught in a lie , it &apos;s sayonara , sweetheart .
this ain &apos;t my first rodeo , eric .
it &apos;s your last night on earth .
who in this room do you sleep with ?
suraci .
no one deserves to die a virgin .
只身赴约 否则凯勒将付出代价 - a
where are you going ? i was just about to make dinner .
the grille . aria and i have plans .
i bought stuff for chicken parmesan .
you did ?
i wanted to make us dinner .
okay , you only cook when you have to tell me something .
no i don &apos;t .
the police came by this morning with a court order .
but i don &apos;t want you to worry .
spencer &apos;s mom is on it ,
and she &apos;s assured me that you &apos;re gonna be fine .
but i just wanted to tell you .
okay .
go ahead . say hi to aria for me .
yeah . thanks , mom .
hi , ted ? it &apos;s ashley .
i know it &apos;s late , but ...
have you eaten yet ?
have you ever been arrested ?
funny you ask that since you dared me
to steal a car last time we played .
and then called the cops .
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
you did ?
yep .
ever make a sex tape ?
i &apos;m really starting to think it was a bad idea that we came here .
there is no way that i &apos;m playing truth
or dare with a bunch of drunk , horny college boys .
okay , shall we go back upstairs ?
yes-- o @-@ kay .
well , i guess that &apos;s to be expected .
yeah , but she &apos;s not .
i think we just found a reason to stay and play .
noel kahn .
who invited you ?
cece drake . you know her ?
not as well as my brother does .
so , you guys back together now ?
so many questions .
i wouldn &apos;t mind a few answers .
then how about a game of truth , noel ?
we &apos;re up next .
me and montgomery .
caleb , what are you doing ? you have to leave .
hanna , get in the car .
no . listen to me .
you have to go now , caleb . please .
hanna , i sent the text .
what ?
i &apos;m &quot; a. &quot;
get in .
hanna , look at me .
look , i know that you &apos;re scared ,
but &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t going to find us out here .
i &apos;m not scared .
okay , good .
i &apos;m freaking out .
you think you know what &apos;s going on , but you don &apos;t !
you showing up to the grille proves that i do .
oh , right .
so you figured out there &apos;s another &quot; a &quot; out there .
caleb , you don &apos;t even know what that means .
it means that you can stop lying to me .
we can be together .
hanna !
look , it &apos;s not that easy , caleb .
this person dug up a grave and stole a body .
this person might have killed maya
because she knew something she shouldn &apos;t have .
this person ...
what , hanna ?
&quot; a &quot; ran your mom off the road .
&quot; a &quot; flew to montecito to scare the crap out of me , and it worked .
that &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t tell you what was going on .
i wanted to , but i couldn &apos;t .
you think i would have just let you walk out the door
if i had the choice ?
go .
where did you meet your current boyfriend ?
at a bar . did you ever invite maya st. germain
to any of these parties ?
geez , you &apos;re morbid .
this is a party , aria .
ask me how many sexual partners i &apos;ve had .
just answer the question .
she came to a few . she had an open invite .
you ever have sex with your teacher ?
no . i never had sex with my teacher .
bull .
it &apos;s my turn .
how do you know maya ?
hot new girl and she likes the ladies
and she moves into the dilaurentis house .
everyone knew maya .
you ever frame anyone for , say ,
stealing answer sheets to the mid @-@ terms ?
maybe you had access to a certain teacher--
that wasn &apos;t me .
where were you the night that alison &apos;s grave was dug up ?
seriously ? you &apos;re really asking me that ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know what night that was .
friday right before labor day .
i don &apos;t know . i guess i was here .
i can vouch for that . he came ,
then ... showed , and they left .
you know i can see you now .
thanks , eric .
anytime , bro .
why don &apos;t you tell us all who your boyfriend is ...
and what he did for a living
during the first few months of your relationship ?
it &apos;s okay , aria .
we already know the answer .
time .
you are so next .
aria .
come on , talk to me . are you okay ?
i &apos;m not going back in there . i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t .
you do not have to .
i cannot believe i let noel
get to me in a freaking game of truth or dare .
what is this , sixth grade ?
not the way they play it .
listen , you did not say anything that could get ezra into trouble .
didn &apos;t i ?
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking that i know you want to leave ,
but i have to stay and find out
what else they know about that night .
what they know , or what they did ?
there you guys are .
is everything okay , aria ?
things got a little vicious in there .
ohh . you are so much prettier than jenna .
honestly , i don &apos;t get what the fuss is about .
thanks .
oh , jenna just said she &apos;s about to leave ,
so if you want to get that round in , you better go quick .
i &apos;ll be fine , okay ? really .
i &apos;ve got a boyfriend on speed @-@ dial
who can come and get me , so go .
go talk to her .
hello ?
ezra ?
uh , no , sorry . it &apos;s wes .
the brother .
hi , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s aria .
oh . the girlfriend .
yeah , that &apos;s me .
um , sorry , where is-- where is ezra ?
oh , right . uh , he &apos;s sort of being detained at the moment .
detained ?
yeah . the dude who bought the jag called ,
and ezra left to meet him .
you want me to tell him you called ?
tell him i was wondering if he could come and pick me up .
i &apos;m like 30 minutes outside of rosewood .
uh , sure , yeah .
what &apos;s the address ?
sure you &apos;re not a saint ?
you just rescued a raccoon with a broken leg .
that was not about me being a saint ,
that was about me being an idiot .
that raccoon had rabies .
more wine ?
i &apos;m gonna need to take that . i &apos;m sorry .
hello .
no , i am not fine .
i have had enough of you targeting my daughter , detective wilden .
if you so much as touch one hair on her head ...
i am telling you , noel ,
i am not gonna be bullied by spencer hastings again .
come on .
there &apos;s gotta be a few things you &apos;re dying to ask her .
i heard you were leaving .
you heard wrong .
i think emily has got a very old soul .
i feel it when i kiss her .
i can hear clocks all over the world running backwards .
if reincarnation exists ,
then emily was once cleopatra .
actually , no , i think she proves reincarnation exists .
you can definitely trace her back to the pyramids--
i &apos;m sorry . your mom let me in .
why is your mother defending a murderer ?
because she thinks that garrett &apos;s innocent .
maybe maya &apos;s murderer is still at large .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s because he started dating your sister ?
i think you &apos;re gonna have to wait your turn .
what you told us about emily ,
you never mentioned that noel was with you that night .
what else did you lie about ?
you know what mutually assured destruction is , right ?
you promised me something the day i told you about emily .
are you going to keep that promise ?
where did you find emily ?
it &apos;s funny . i &apos;m starting to wonder
where she was when you found her .
just answer the question .
we were trying to help your friend , okay ?
we saw her at some diner , drunk off her ass--
oh . so you found her in a diner , not in the middle of the road .
well , the &quot; drunk off her ass &quot; part is true .
you get her that way ?
no . did you ?
no .
so why did you lie ?
i lied because i was trying to protect someone .
isn &apos;t that why you lied about your parents &apos; lake house ?
don &apos;t worry , that was rhetorical .
this isn &apos;t : where is the video ?
what video do you mean ? there is more then one .
you know which one . where is it ?
it &apos;s safe .
where ? !
i want to know where ali &apos;s body is .
and if you can tell me that ,
you can have all the damn videos you want .
oops . time &apos;s up .
hey . hop in .
what are you doing here ?
well , ezra &apos;s really busy . so--
first you take his phone , then you take his car ...
what &apos;s next ?
actually , don &apos;t answer that .
you mind if we grab a bite on the way ?
what about maya &apos;s website ?
caleb--
if we figure out who killed maya ,
then we can figure out who &quot; a &quot; is .
i &apos;m not going down this road with you .
hanna , this could be somebody that you were really close to .
another mona . are you prepared for that ?
caleb ! this isn &apos;t easy for me , either ! all right ?
i have missed you so much ,
it &apos;s making me do stupid things , crazy things .
hanna , you &apos;re talking to the guy
who just kidnapped his own girlfriend .
and you know what ? for the record ...
i am going to help you stop &quot; a. &quot;
and i &apos;m not asking for your permission .
well , figured that out , finally .
hey . i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
good luck .
okay , here i am . what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
aria left , i don &apos;t know anybody at this party ,
you &apos;re my ride , and i couldn &apos;t find you anywhere .
i was a little preoccupied .
okay . why did you really bring me here ?
there &apos;s no upenn guy who works at admissions anywhere in this cabin .
was this just some excuse so you could hook up with eric ?
can i please just have my application back ?
no , you can &apos;t .
steven has it .
what ?
you left the game room after your round with jenna .
steven showed up for all of two minutes , slipped out .
i gave him your application ,
i told him how smart you are . we had a lovely chat .
it &apos;s probably in the &quot; on time &quot; pile
as we speak right now .
you had a lovely chat with steven about how smart i am .
yes .
okay , can we please just get out of here ?
what ?
we both got what we came for , right ?
so can we please just go ?
yeah . let &apos;s go .
i can &apos;t thank you enough , veronica . really .
okay , you too . bye .
so i guess it &apos;s too late to open the red .
um , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ... idle hands .
you &apos;re apologizing for cleaning up my kitchen .
please , don &apos;t .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s sorry . i &apos;ve ruined the evening .
i guess you may have gathered that wasn &apos;t my divorce lawyer .
i &apos;ve got one of those .
they usually don &apos;t call at nine at night
asking about blood tests .
this deranged cop wants to get hanna in trouble
for something she couldn &apos;t possibly have done .
but he &apos;s already decided she &apos;s a criminal ,
so who cares about probable cause ?
sounds like hanna &apos;s gonna be okay , though .
yeah .
thank god .
when you left the church social that night ,
was it because you thought i might judge you for ,
i don &apos;t know , being ... human ?
i &apos;m not a saint .
you know , police officers aren &apos;t the only ones
who make assumptions about people .
just because a man has been ordained ...
it &apos;s really was wonderful seeing you .
i think we got off on the wrong foot .
i &apos;m really a nice person .
you didn &apos;t give ezra the message , did you ?
if you were gonna wait for him to get to you ,
you &apos;d have been waiting all night .
i was just trying to help .
yeah , like you were trying to help him out with the car ?
and now you &apos;re trying to help your mom get him to buy it back ?
i know my family must seem really weird and dysfunctional--
no , i get dysfunctional . i have dysfunctional .
you people are hostile .
you &apos;re throwing money around--
i mean , these are people &apos;s real lives . you know that , right ?
so he told you about maggie .
i didn &apos;t even find out until recently .
i was pretty young when it happened .
ezra gets her pregnant , wants to do the right thing ,
and then my mom shows up with her magic purse strings .
whoosh ! there goes that problem .
what do you mean , &quot; there goes that problem &quot; ?
mom made sure , you know , she took care of it .
ezra didn &apos;t tell you about that , did he ?
no , he did not .
is there any way you can just drive
this thing a little bit faster , please ?
i &apos;m sorry .
this isn &apos;t the way i wanna tonight to go .
i shouldn &apos;t have put this all on you .
i just found out about the website ,
and this was the first time hearing her voice .
my grandfather passed away when i was fifteen .
he had this outrageous sense of humor .
i mean , he would do anything for a laugh .
last spring my mom was cleaning out the basement ,
and she found this old home video .
my dad had bought her a camcorder for christmas ,
and everyone was passing it around and being silly ,
and by the time it got to my grandpa allan ...
he just mooned the camera .
we &apos;re talking 70 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ man @-@ butt , full frame ,
and there was a tattoo .
oh , my god , stop .
it was a tulip .
that &apos;s amazing .
and then he just burst out laughing .
the sound ...
it was like he was in the room .
it was spooky , actually . but ...
also really good .
i don &apos;t want it to keep hurting .
good , you &apos;re back .
i left my phone inside .
yeah , i know , i ... called you for a ride and was picked up .
he told me about maggie .
come inside .
i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t ?
i need to know what happened .
well , i can &apos;t believe that wes would tell you that in the first--
he thought that i knew , ezra .
he thought we were the kind of people
who told each other things , and so did i.
so i need to hear the truth from you , right now .
wait-- no . ar @-@ aria .
aria , wait .
you got somebody pregnant in high school ?
it was the summer after graduation .
maggie . what happened ?
my mom happened .
she and i always saw things differently--
for as long as i can remember .
but i was scared .
maggie was scared .
we thought she could help .
i told her about maggie , and she said that she &apos;d ...
she &apos;d handle it .
eighteen years old and pregnant ,
and here &apos;s this woman telling you how it &apos;s gonna be .
your mom offered her money ?
she was determined to keep me on track ,
and that didn &apos;t include me becoming a father at eighteen .
that &apos;s one word for it .
i was going to go to vassar ,
but then that suddenly became too close to home ,
so i transferred to hollis and i became a fitz .
and maggie ?
there were terms involved with the money .
they included never talking to me again .
please come inside .
please .
okay .
i just called to say i miss you ...
i &apos;m worried about you , and ...
i just really miss you .
just a moment , dear .
it should be right here .
i think you &apos;ll be very happy with the unit .
as long as you pay on time ,
you won &apos;t be hearing from the landlord much , either .
hang on . let &apos;s see .
it was here .
oh , here we are .
unit &quot; a , &quot; right ?
