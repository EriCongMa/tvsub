第三季 第十八集
mike &apos;s therapy hit a snag . &lt; / i &gt;
i keep telling you , i don &apos;t remember !
something happened at that movie ?
who &apos;d you see it with ?
probably susan ...
why not ask her ?
mike , it wasn &apos;t a movie . that was us .
what ?
the first night we spent together .
i saw you watching us .
we were just talking .
gabby saw another side of victor . &lt; / i &gt;
i didn &apos;t marry an angry woman .
i divorced one .
i set her up in a nice house . i gave her an allowance .
and then i came and went as i pleased .
i &apos;ve known you two weeks ,
this is the first glimpse of a guy i could actually like .
&lt; i &gt; tom &apos;s back put him out of commission . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;ll be a while before he &apos;s back on his feet .
how much of a while ?
three months .
and edie bared more than her soul for carlos . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m asking for a chance .
edie britt had always thought of herself as passionate . &lt; / i &gt;
aggressively , &lt; / i &gt;
relentlessly , &lt; / i &gt;
violently passionate . &lt; / i &gt;
carlos solis had always thought of himself as passionate . &lt; / i &gt;
romantically , &lt; / i &gt;
spontaneously , &lt; / i &gt;
constantly passionate . &lt; / i &gt;
so it was natural for edie and carlos to assume that &lt; / i &gt;
if they ever had sex , it would be amazing . &lt; / i &gt;
and in fact , it was ... &lt; / i &gt;
amazingly bad . &lt; / i &gt;
morning .
morning .
so ... last night ...
yeah , i know . wow
super wow .
is that clock right ?
oh , man , i gotta get to work .
yeah . i gotta get home .
so , uh ... so we should do this again .
oh , definitely . this week doesn &apos;t seem to be that great .
maybe ...
next week i &apos;m swamped .
oh . well , we &apos;ll figure something out .
it was at that moment edie and carlos &lt; / i &gt;
had the exact same thought ... &lt; / i &gt;
thank you .
no . thank you .
they would definitely be having sex again ... &lt; / i &gt;
just not ... &lt; / i &gt;
... with each other . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s so easy to spot the lonely ones . &lt; / i &gt;
it wasn &apos;t the first time ...
they &apos;re the people who tell stories to their plants ... &lt; / i &gt;
i kinda like him .
... and whisper secrets to their pets . &lt; / i &gt;
come on ! get him of basketball !
and have arguments with their tv . &lt; / i &gt;
he &apos;s running like his feet are made out of lead !
and the loneliest of all , &lt; / i &gt;
are the ones who talk to people . &lt; / i &gt;
you know what i think over ?
people who are no longer there . &lt; / i &gt;
phone &apos;s gonna ring any second .
and it &apos;s gonna be lynette begging me to come over early .
did i tell you that tom had surgery
on his back last week ?
yep , that idiot &apos;s flat on his ass
while lynette brings home the bacon . again .
i shouldn &apos;t judge .
plenty of people didn &apos;t get what i saw in you .
i won &apos;t name names ... my sister gayle .
but i always told her that
beneath all the name @-@ calling and the dish @-@ throwing ,
we really loved each other .
bet you 50 bucks it &apos;s lynette .
hello ?
you lose , gilbert . what &apos;s up ?
i have to get to the restaurant early .
is there any way you can come over and
get the kids off to school ?
why am i seeing pajamas ? get dressed .
yeah , they are ready to go . so what do you say ?
oh , great . thanks . i owe you big time .
ok , bye .
all right . i &apos;m heading out of here . wish me luck .
more interviews this morning ?
yeah , but don &apos;t worry ,
i &apos;m gonna find the assistant manager of your dreams .
you sure ? because the last ten resume you showed me ...
yeah , i know , i know .
bottom of the barrel , convicts and losers .
you &apos;re clear about that last night .
it make sure they really know how to wrangle the employees .
like kim , she never buses her tables .
i &apos;m the one who told you that .
oh , you &apos;re right .
hey , honey , i had an idea about the specials for today ...
i was thinking goat cheese and mushrooms .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , tom !
i &apos;m gonna be late for the interviews . i should go .
honey , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry . i know i am driving you crazy .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m feeling guilty laying here ,
totally worthless ,
while you run the restaurant and the house .
it &apos;s ok . i am gonna find a way to make this all work .
and you just get better .
oh , mrs. mccluskey , perfect timing .
make sure you have your cell phone with you .
then while you &apos;re interviewing ,
i &apos;ll call , you can conference me in .
that is a great idea .
hi . tom &apos;s gonna ask you to look for this .
you will not find it .
love you .
here &apos;s your beer .
oh , good job , chipmunk . no foam this time .
i tipped the glass just like you told me to .
i think someone &apos;s ready to salt his first margarita glass .
mommy , do you have trouble going to sleep ?
no .
why do you ask ?
i heard carlos say you were bad in bed .
what ?
why &apos;d he say that ? do you have nightmares ?
ok , sweetie , i need you to focus .
what exactly did carlos say , and who did he say it to ?
i went to get my soccer ball from his yard .
he was on the phone talking to someone .
so what does &quot; bad in bed &quot; mean ?
oh , it means you &apos;re not good at making ...
... your bed .
mommy doesn &apos;t like people saying she can &apos;t make a bed .
because , trust me ,
nobody makes a bed as good as your mommy .
if you want , i can tell people you &apos;re good in bed .
no , no , no . that &apos;s fine , sweetie .
if you want to help mommy , just um ...
... top off her breakfast .
susan , i &apos;m by the orange stand , where are you ?
cheese stand ?
no , i don &apos;t mind you going back for free samples ,
but if you like it why not just buy some ?
yes , of course , you &apos;re right .
it always tastes better when it &apos;s free .
i get it , please hurry .
oh . hello .
hey .
boy , you &apos;re everywhere these days .
excuse me ?
yesterday , susan and i ran into you at the post office .
last week , the movies .
one might think you &apos;re following us .
trust me , &quot; one &quot; has better things to do
than follow you around .
and yet here you are ... again .
ian , fairview is a small town .
you want distance ? move to the city .
you &apos;ve been awfully quiet since we left the market .
is everything ok ?
um , well , since you asked ,
i &apos;m having some problems at work .
really ?
yes , we &apos;re in the midst of some corporate restructuring .
i &apos;m going to have to spend more time in london .
ok .
and , i was thinking ,
maybe you and i should just ... relocate .
to london ? permanently ?
i know it &apos;s sudden ...
yeah , it &apos;s sudden !
my whole life is here , my friends ...
julie is still in school .
susan !
oh , my god ! are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
ok . i can feel the car sinking .
we &apos;re gonna have to get to shore .
ian ?
how deep do you think this water is ?
deep enough . come on , let &apos;s move !
susan ...
i can &apos;t swim .
what ? you ... you said you played water polo .
i said polo ! with horses !
how can you not know how to swim ?
didn &apos;t you go to summer camp ?
i stayed in the canoe ! let it go !
ok , don &apos;t panic .
just grab onto my neck and i &apos;ll swim for both of us .
i &apos;m twice your size ! we might drown !
let &apos;s just stay here and think of something else .
if you stay here , you &apos;ll definitely drown !
do you see how my plan is better ?
look , there &apos;s somebody on the shore !
it &apos;s mike ! he &apos;s here !
of course he is .
mike !
ok , ok , ok ! i can walk from here !
sorry . you were just gripping me so tight .
oh , my god . mike , you saved our lives .
and our cheese !
ian , can you believe it ?
mike saved our cheese !
yes . he &apos;s quite the hero .
yeah . good thing i was following you .
arnie , thanks for coming in .
we will definitely keep you in mind .
ok .
come on ! what was wrong with that guy ?
he kept asking what we do with the food people don &apos;t eat .
all right , so he &apos;s a fat loser .
who &apos;d you expect to get for $ 8.50 an hour ?
that &apos;s what we pay you , and you seem happy enough .
well , that &apos;s because i &apos;m doing the beer delivery guy .
ok . my fault for asking .
rick coletti ?
that &apos;s me .
oh , great , come on over .
your application ?
one second .
that &apos;s been bothering me . sorry .
no , it &apos;s great , you can spell .
you are now officially the front @-@ runner .
yeah , my grandma came over from naples .
been making calzones since before you were born .
how old do you think i am ?
thirty ? thirty @-@ one ?
not afraid to shamelessly ass @-@ kiss . you &apos;re doing very well .
great . wanna skip to the part where you hire me ?
well , i should probably take a look at your application first .
ok .
don &apos;t be afraid if you don &apos;t have experience .
i realize for what we &apos;re paying ,
we &apos;re not exactly gonna get a ...
you were the sous @-@ chef at cucina ?
yeah .
that &apos;s a five @-@ star @-@ restaurant .
actually , four .
which is four more than we have .
yeah , but this place has character and charm ,
and a beautiful owner .
yeah , but seriously , why would a
four @-@ star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint ?
mrs. mccluskey !
i &apos;m right here . keep your shirt on .
i need another pill .
and please tell the kids to turn down the tv .
i yell , they turn it down . i walk away , they turn it up .
vicious circle .
surely you can control five little kids .
can i beat &apos; em ?
no .
then my hands are tied .
hi , i &apos;m home . and i &apos;ve got good news .
i found a new manager .
that &apos;s terrific .
yeah .
his name is rick coletti
and he was a sous @-@ chef at cucina .
cucina ? why does he want to work at our place ?
yeah , i had that exact same thought .
and to be honest , he has a history .
history ?
you know how stressful it is at a four @-@ star @-@ restaurant .
he , like many chefs , started using cocaine to ...
oh , no , no . no way .
he &apos;s been clean for almost a year .
we &apos;re not the betty ford clinic .
no , i know . but i &apos;ve got a good feeling about this guy .
all he wants is a fresh start .
i am not gonna hire a junkie who &apos;s gonna turn around
and then hock our jukebox just to feed his habit .
no , find somebody else .
i can &apos;t find somebody else .
i &apos;ve interviewed 50 guys ,
and this &quot; junkie &quot; happens to be the best .
seriously , i don &apos;t know how much longer i can ...
lynette , please , can we just talk about this later ?
i &apos;m in a lot of pain .
i &apos;m sorry .
please just do what i am asking .
fine . i &apos;ii , uh , keep looking .
jerk .
i had a good time tonight . who knew you could dance ?
it &apos;s one of my hidden talents .
invite me in . i &apos;ll show you another .
not tonight , thanks .
you &apos;d tango with a man , and not have sex with him ?
that &apos;s actually against the law in argentina .
come on , we both know it &apos;s gonna happen eventually .
and every time you say that ,
&quot; eventually &quot; gets a little further away .
stop begging or i &apos;m not going to your rally tomorrow .
ok , fine . i can be patient .
far as i &apos;m concerned , the chase is half the fun .
half the fun ? oh , honey , if i ever do say yes ...
... you &apos;re gonna adjust that percentage way down .
you can &apos;t possibly be eating more cheese .
what , you &apos;ve never heard of a midnight snack ?
unless you can think of something else that
i can nibble on .
slide over , you cheddar @-@ breathed tease .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a thank you gift for mike .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,
but didn &apos;t we already thank him at the shore ,
and again when he dropped us off ?
i don &apos;t think you can thank somebody too many times
for saving your life .
i wish you &apos;d stop saying that .
saying what ?
that he saved my life .
i certainly could have survived without his help .
but if anybody did any life @-@ saving , it was me .
you ?
yes .
if i hadn &apos;t warned you about the dear ,
you &apos;ll go straight through the windshield
and you would have ended up with an antler in your brain .
ok .
that &apos;s a good point .
thank you .
but we were in a bit of a jam there ,
and i don &apos;t think you should be embarrassed
for needing a little help .
i &apos;m not embarrassed . i don &apos;t feel emasculated either .
emasculated ? who said emasculated ?
and why are you not kissing me now ?
i &apos;m ready when you are .
ok .
i guess we &apos;re cutting right to the ...
don &apos;t worry . it happens to everybody .
maybe it would help to talk about it .
no . i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
all right . we won &apos;t talk about it .
want some cheese ?
hey , how are you ?
i &apos;m good . you might not think so , but i am good .
where in the hell do you get off
telling people that i am bad in bed ?
i never said that !
travers heard you on the phone .
ok , i &apos;m sorry .
i was talking to my cousin in tucson .
we always trade bad date stories .
and you think that i went out of my way
to spare your feelings .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you think you were bored ?
i &apos;ve had more thrills leaning up against my dryer .
then what was all that moaning ?
i was in pain ! you were smashing my breasts .
oh , come on .
you hunkered down on top of me
like you were hiding from border patrol .
i was tired ! you just laid there while i did all the work .
when we were done , i felt like i should deflate you .
yeah , well , sex is like tennis .
when you play an inferior opponent , your game suffers .
are you challenging me to a rematch ?
maybe .
so you want to do it again ?
if it &apos;ll shut you up .
yeah , i &apos;ll fall on that grenade .
oh , there &apos;s gonna be an explosion . come on .
i &apos;m prescribing a mild painkiller for your back .
and i will see you in a week to remove those stitches .
great .
so how &apos;d you folks get so banged up ? car accident ?
bad sex .
really bad .
ok .
thanks .
god , what a disaster .
oh , i don &apos;t know . maybe it &apos;s for the best .
how so ?
well , we got it out of our system .
now we can go back to being friends .
i mean , we like hanging out ,
and travers adores you .
yeah , and i wouldn &apos;t want to ruin that .
still , it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
oh , i know . i &apos;m hot , you &apos;re hot .
on paper , we should be having great sex .
well , we could always try again .
yeah , me neither .
yes , this town is hungry for change .
&lt; i &gt; when gabrielle agreed to attend &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; victor lang &apos;s campaign rally , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she was fully prepared to be bored . &lt; / i &gt;
i give you the next mayor of fairview , victor lang !
&lt; i &gt; but when victor took the stage , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; gabrielle found herself strangely enthralled . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; perhaps it was the cheers that greeted his arrival . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; perhaps it was the confidence he exuded . &lt; / i &gt;
or perhaps it was the effect he had &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; on the citizens of fairview . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; whatever the reason , gabby decided , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; not only did victor lang have her vote ... &lt; / i &gt;
thank you .
&lt; i &gt; ... it was time to make a campaign contribution . &lt; / i &gt;
sorry . excuse me , excuse me . sorry .
i &apos;m afraid mr. lang has to take an important meeting
in his limo .
now .
to the radio station , clyde .
so what &apos;s this all about ?
your speech . i liked it .
seriously ? here ? now ?
well , you laid out all your positions .
don &apos;t you want to get acquainted with mine ?
clyde , could you put up the partition ?
yes , sir . anything else ?
music . loud music .
mrs. mccluskey ! it has been ten minutes .
where &apos;s my pie ?
i &apos;m unloading the dishwasher .
you &apos;ll get your damn pie when i &apos;m done .
mrs. mccluskey !
i want my pie now .
oh , yeah . yeah , you heard me .
your being here isn &apos;t charity .
we pay you good money to help us .
so when i ask you to do something , i want it done .
well , here &apos;s a surprise for you : i quit .
what ? what ? why ? why ? what happened ?
five kids are tough enough ,
but your husband makes six .
and that &apos;s where i draw the line .
ok . i know that tom has been a little cranky lately .
no , i &apos;m cranky . he &apos;s insufferable .
i hate to admit this , lynette ,
but every time that man screams out in pain ,
i do a little jig inside .
look , i &apos;ll talk to tom ...
no , my mind &apos;s made up .
wait , wait ! please !
don &apos;t do this . i am at the end of my rope .
i wish i could help you , lynette .
i can see that you &apos;re going down ,
but i &apos;m just too old to get dragged down with you .
ok , everybody , go on up to bed .
parker , you got the baby .
yeah , that &apos;s exactly right . you know what to do .
before you speak , just know that
ever since mccluskey left , i &apos;ve been lying here
feeling like the biggest jerk ever .
tomorrow morning i am gonna call her and apologize .
i will fix this .
well , you might also want to apologize
to the customer who found a lego in her pizza .
oh , god , did the kids do that ?
i hope .
oh , god , it was so awful tonight .
oh , honey . you know what you need ?
what ?
a seeing to .
once the kids are asleep ,
slip on that sexy blue thing and then
sneak back down here .
you want to have sex ?
but you &apos;re immobile .
ok , maybe full @-@ on sex is a little ambitious ,
but there &apos;s other stuff that we could do .
but you can &apos;t bend at the waist ,
and that pretty much leaves the heavy lifting to me .
trust me , if you get us to the finish line ,
i will cross it .
is that why you apologized , just so i &apos;d service you ?
honey , i have been trapped in this bed all day long .
i &apos;m bored , i &apos;m miserable .
can &apos;t you do this one little thing for me ?
i have been doing everything i can
to keep our heads above water .
i can &apos;t do you too .
&lt; i &gt; for gabrielle , the best part of having sex &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; with a new man was seeing how quickly &lt; / i &gt;
his affection would turn to obsession . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no messages . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but when victor failed to call the next morning ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no messages . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... or the next afternoon ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no messages . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... it was gabrielle who began obsessing . &lt; / i &gt;
not a peep , in 24 hours !
he &apos;s busy . isn &apos;t he debating the mayor tonight ?
i don &apos;t care ! he can find two lousy minutes for me !
i &apos;m here . deal me in .
sorry , no poker today . lynette had to work .
want a margarita ?
well , i &apos;d like three , but i &apos;ll start with one .
ms. solis ? sorry to interrupt . you have any water ?
yeah , in the fridge .
who is that ?
and why don &apos;t you put your water on a lower shelf ?
thank you .
that &apos;s toby . he &apos;s fixing my closet .
has your cocky boyfriend gotten a load of the help ?
move away from that topic .
we had sex yesterday , in his limo ...
oh , i love limo sex . town car or stretch ?
stretch , of course . i &apos;m not a complete slut .
the point is , he hasn &apos;t called since .
so how was the sex ?
fantastic . as good as with carlos .
that good , huh ?
god . i &apos;m such an idiot . i gave it up way too fast .
now i &apos;ve lost all the power .
oh , come on .
no , i &apos;m serious . our mothers had the right idea .
they let men think they were the ones who needed sex
and women just went along as a favor .
men begged for every crumb ,
and we never lost the upper hand .
yeah , no guy respects an easy conquest .
i make all my men wait .
it &apos;s true .
she has a little room with magazines and an aquarium .
i have so missed our friendship .
i think if you really like this guy ,
you should just be honest .
tell him that you feel a little hurt ...
oh yeah , whining is really gonna bring him to his knees .
you want to get this guy back in line ?
you hit him hard , hit him fast . is he the jealous type ?
aren &apos;t they all ?
so what should i do to make him jealous ?
i got the shelves up .
anything else ?
my opponent thinks we should combat prostitution
by mounting surveillance cameras
to embarrass the customers .
i call that a blatant violation of our citizens &apos; privacy .
mr mayor , if you &apos;re worried about privacy , wear a hat ,
keep your head down and you &apos;ll be fine .
ok , thank you very much , gentlemen .
so let &apos;s move on to our next subject .
you both have said our citizens pay too much in taxes .
how would you attract new businesses
to boost the city &apos;s tax base ?
mr. lang ?
mr. lang ?
i &apos;m sorry , would you , uh , repeat the question , please ?
how would you bring new business to fairview ?
i would , uh ...
... offer tax exemptions to first year start @-@ ups .
and that will increase our tax base ?
no , of course not . not at first , but when conjoined with ...
my opponent seems a bit overtaxed himself .
gentlemen , there &apos;s been much talk lately
regarding our local schools .
what would you do to improve public education ?
mr. lang ?
here you go . sorry for the wait .
miss ? please ?
i will be right there .
oh , my god , mrs. scavo , i am so sorry .
don &apos;t cry . just clean .
miss , if you could just ...
i swear , i will be there in one second .
here you go . here .
let me guess ... this a bad time ?
oh , my god , rick . i never got back to you .
i am so sorry .
that &apos;s ok . i didn &apos;t mind waiting ,
so long as it &apos;s good news for me now .
look , i think you &apos;re great ,
and we would be lucky to have you .
it &apos;s just my husband isn &apos;t really comfortable ...
with an ex @-@ drug addict in his kitchen .
you can drug test me every week . anything you want .
just ... i really need this job .
miss !
could you excuse me a second ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s up ?
i hate my calzone .
oh ? what &apos;s wrong with it ?
it &apos;s just not good , and i want a new one .
all right . all right .
i will put your order in , but the kitchen &apos;s a little backed up .
not my problem .
you gave me a sucky calzone .
i don &apos;t care if you have to go back there
and make it yourself !
i can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s just ...
what is this ?
i &apos;ll make you a new calzone , sir .
fresh basil , garlic . you like sun dried tomatoes ?
yeah , sounds good .
hey , is she all right ?
it &apos;s her grandma &apos;s calzone recipe .
she takes criticism very personally .
prep some dough for a calzone for me ,
and get someone to chop some basil .
yeah , ok . who are you ?
i &apos;m rick .
you work here now ?
looks like i do .
oh , is that new ?
i just bought it .
but if you don &apos;t like it , feel free to rip it off me .
i have this book proposal to discuss at an 8 am meeting ,
so i can &apos;t really ...
oh , that &apos;s ok . if you gotta work , you gotta work .
so i was thinking about london .
yeah . julie &apos;s gonna be applying to colleges soon ,
and a year abroad could give her a real boost .
so ... let &apos;s do it .
are you serious ?
yes . i want to spend time in your world .
i want to play cricket , i want to eat crumpets
and i want to use the word &quot; ghastly . &quot;
god , susan ,
you have no idea how excited this makes me feel .
well , my thigh &apos;s getting an inkling .
call a realtor first thing tomorrow and
put our houses on the market .
not mine , ok ? we can use it when we visit .
that &apos;s what hotels are for , darling .
i don &apos;t want to sell my house .
everybody i love is on this street .
what happened ?
i &apos;m feeling tired .
you weren &apos;t tired a second ago .
i &apos;m not in the mood , all right ?
why not ?
you know , i &apos;m not used to being grilled about my sex drive .
well , i &apos;m not used to
guys bailing on me in the middle of foreplay .
and by guys , of course , you mean mike .
what ?
oh , i &apos;m sure good old mike was ready and able , 24 / 7 .
you &apos;re not actually ...
oh , ok . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;ve had it !
susan !
really ! i can &apos;t have this conversation one more time !
i &apos;ve done nothing
but prove my love to you for the last year ,
and you cannot shut up about mike !
i don &apos;t trust the man !
you don &apos;t have to trust mike !
you have to trust me and you don &apos;t !
that &apos;s what going to england &apos;s about , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re just trying to get me away from mike .
you know what , screw it ! i &apos;m not going !
and if you ever bring up his name again , we &apos;re over !
got it ? over !
hi . this is from me and ian .
an electric juicer ?
well , you know , you try to think of a more appropriate
&quot; thank you for saving my life &quot; gift .
this works fine for me .
good .
i should go .
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m good .
you sure about that ?
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;s just ...
ian and i had a little thing .
ian , about what i said ...
you were right .
you &apos;ve never given me a reason to doubt you .
i &apos;m an insecure idiot .
i don &apos;t deserve you , susan .
but if you &apos;ll please keep pretending that i do ,
i swear , i will not utter a single jealous word
for the rest of our lives together .
gabby , it &apos;s victor . what were you thinking ?
that little stunt of yours almost cost me the debate ...
it &apos;s me again . ok , i get it .
i forgot to call , and you were mad .
but still ...
hi , i hope you got the flowers .
again , i &apos;m so sorry for not calling .
gabby , come on .
what &apos;s it gonna take for you to forgive me ?
i &apos;ll do anything you want .
i brought you some flowers .
in case the other three bouquets get lonely .
thank you . you can go now .
i don &apos;t want to take any more time out of your busy schedule .
for god sake , gaby .
how many times do i have to say i &apos;m sorry ?
what i did was thoughtless and inconsiderate .
yes , it was .
but what you did was that vicious .
trying to get your attention .
by humiliating me in public ?
hey , you hurt me .
if i have to strike back to protect myself ...
that &apos;s what you think this is , combat ?
i have been taken for granted before ,
i &apos;m not going to let it happen again .
if i &apos;m going to give myself to you , you better worship me !
and i will do that . morning and evening services .
good .
but you have to stop treating this like
it &apos;s a boxing match only one of us can win .
maybe you haven &apos;t noticed , but i &apos;m in love with you .
it would be nice if you &apos;d take the gloves off and trust me .
you &apos;re in love with me ?
yeah .
my campaign , that &apos;s about winning .
this , you and me , it &apos;s about happiness .
and we could both use a little .
but maybe you need time to think about it .
look , no gloves .
travers conked out the moment his head hit the pillow .
poor little guy was beat .
well , he should be . we covered every inch of that zoo .
oh , check this out . you and travers at the monkey house .
oh , i look squinty . delete , delete !
there &apos;s the one the pretzel guy took .
oh , look at the three of us . you have to e @-@ mail me that one .
isn &apos;t that great ?
you know , he thought that travers had my eyes .
seriously ?
he totally thought we were a family .
oh , well , if we were ,
we &apos;d be one hell of a good @-@ iooking one .
yeah . nothing better than family .
and this time i really mean it .
yeah ... me , too .
well , are you gonna say anything ?
to be honest , i &apos;ve heard better apologies .
but i know how hard this must have been for you ,
and that makes me happy .
so i accept .
thanks . that &apos;s big of you .
and it &apos;s big of you to admit you &apos;re a chucklehead .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
did you hear that , gilbert ? he apologized .
i mean , i know he did it just for her sake , but still .
maybe they have a good marriage after all .
but they &apos;ll never have what we had .
will they , gilbert ?
not by a long shot .
&lt; i &gt; passion &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it &apos;s a force so potent &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we still remember it long after it &apos;s faded away . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a drive so alluring , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it can push us into the arms of unexpected lovers . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a sensation so overwhelming , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it can knock down walls we &apos;ve built to protect our hearts . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a feeling so intense , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it resurfaces even though we tried so hard &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to keep it buried . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , of all emotions , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; passion is the one that gives us a reason to live ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... and an excuse to commit all sorts of crimes . &lt; / i &gt;
