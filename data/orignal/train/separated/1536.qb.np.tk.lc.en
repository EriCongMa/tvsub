i &apos;m starving .
any chance that &apos;s for me ?
oh , no . it is for mom .
i &apos;m planning on making some bad choices tonight ,
and i &apos;m gonna need her on my side .
i never realized the forethought
that went into being a disappointment .
hey , uncle mitch . what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ? it &apos;s uncle mitchell &apos;s birthday fun day .
we know !
yeah ! yeah !
we are so excited you are finally cashing this in .
me too .
we forgot to get uncle mitchell a present for his last birthday .
so , we came up with this great idea --
a coupon for a fun day with the three of us .
it was perfect because it was so sweet
and we &apos;d never have to do it .
i hope you &apos;re ready for your first big surprise !
i am .
it &apos;s a super @-@ fun omelet !
aww ! uh , yeah !
and if you were wondering what is so super @-@ fun about that ,
is that it comes with a -- a side of , uh ...
luke &apos;s omelet dance !
don &apos;t be shy . you &apos;ve been practicing all week . come on .
okay . uh ...
* it &apos;s your birthday *
* i &apos;m an omelet *
* it &apos;s your birthday *
* i &apos;m an omelet *
it &apos;s your birthday
this is a living nightmare .
why would he just show up ?
shouldn &apos;t he have given us some notice ?
i kind of remember him calling about it ,
but i would &apos;ve put it in my phone --
oh , there it is .
of course .
oh , my god . i &apos;m supposed to be cat @-@ sitting .
we have to figure out something good .
he &apos;s the first to call us on our birthdays ,
and he always gets us amazing presents .
are you even listening to me ?
how long can a cat go without eating ?
haley , he is the best uncle there is .
this cannot be our present .
* it &apos;s your birthday *
* i &apos;m an omelet , it &apos;s your birthday *
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening , but i love it .
it &apos;s your birthday .
it &apos;s my birthday .
i &apos;m an omelet .
you &apos;re an omelet .
if you &apos;re going to keep giggling , i &apos;ll do my own nails .
i &apos;m sorry -- it &apos;s just funny , the juxtaposition .
i get it -- i &apos;m asian .
it &apos;s racist , daddy .
sorry .
lily , look who it is -- our lovely canadian guests .
please come in .
how is everything upstairs ?
it &apos;s like a palace up there .
i keep expecting to run into gordon pinsent .
i &apos;m sorry .
is he not a big movie star down here ?
no . but thank you for ryan reynolds .
one little thing -- we &apos;re going to see the handprints
at the chinese theater , and i &apos;m worried
it &apos;s going to look disrespectful if rob wears shorts .
honey , it &apos;s 55 degrees out . i &apos;m not wearing long pants .
you &apos;re fine . it &apos;s hollywood .
there &apos;ll be people there with no pants .
hi , lily .
lily , say hi to monte .
hi .
i &apos;m ... sorry . she &apos;s never this shy .
no , we &apos;sorry . seems like something scared her .
it was adorable .
lily was clearly smitten with that little canadian monte .
just heard that . delightful .
it was a rite of passage that i had been looking forward to --
my daughter &apos;s first crush .
and i wanted to be there for her
in a way that no one was there for me .
of course , my first crush was on a statue
of a confederate general in front of a courthouse .
that &apos;s the same year they put up
the &quot; do not climb the statue &quot; signs .
sorry i &apos;m late .
is this shirt okay ? i got another one in the car .
it &apos;s just lunch . calm down .
your boyfriend &apos;s gonna love it .
last summer , phil and i went to cabo for five days ,
and we met tom and lisa delaney , and we had so much fun ,
we make sure to see them every time they &apos;re in town .
tom &apos;s a hugely successful investment banker .
he does tons of charity work ,
he runs a marathon in 3 : 24,
and he flies his own helicopter .
yeah , and lisa ...
yeah , she is one lucky lady .
before they get here ,
can you promise me you won &apos;t pick up the check ?
why ?
oh , honey , i like them ,
but we &apos;ve seen them three times since cabo .
every time , they order the most expensive stuff .
they are the richest people we know --
thank you .
and yet i have not seen him reach for the check once .
tom has trouble reaching for stuff .
he hurt his shoulder pitching in college .
division 1 .
you feel a need to pick up the check
because you &apos;re intimidated by him
and you want to prove something .
that &apos;s crazy . i just don &apos;t like it when the bill sits there .
it &apos;s awkward .
you can &apos;t just roll over on something
&apos;cause it makes you feel uncomfortable .
whatever you want .
hello , beautiful .
hi , handsome .
hey , you two .
hi ! oh , my gosh . it is so great to see you guys .
let &apos;s get some champagne .
let &apos;s do it .
okay , that &apos;s it .
if you hate it so much , just tell me .
fine . your cologne is horrible .
you smell like a stripper died in a cabin .
i &apos;m not talking about my cologne .
that &apos;s why i hang back and wait for him to get specific .
my mustache .
i &apos;ve been growing it for weeks ,
and the two of you have been conspicuously silent .
it &apos;s very dashing .
what mustache ?
right , jay . like i &apos;m supposed to believe you didn &apos;t see it .
you got me .
check you later , serpico .
serpico !
you don &apos;t even know who that is .
jay .
where are you going with your golf clubs ?
take a shot in the dark .
but we have a playdate .
really ? we just had one last night .
not that i &apos;m saying no --
just quicker turnaround than usual .
a playdate for joe .
and both parents are coming , so you have to be here .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i mean , it &apos;s bad enough that these kids today
have to make a date to play with each other .
they can &apos;t go in the street and kick a can
or drool over a friend &apos;s centerfold of kim novak .
say something i understand .
why do we all have to sit around and watch our kids play ?
because that &apos;s what people do now .
and joe is very excited about it .
his first real friend .
gloria ...
what &apos;s the problem ?
i like the mom , and everybody says
that you and the dad have a lot in common .
it &apos;s going to be fun .
come in , everybody .
gloria , this is my husband , marty .
look at you .
pretty as a pinup .
and where &apos;s the lucky husband i &apos;ve been hearing about ?
marty , that &apos;s jay .
oh , good . you are old .
i was scared they were exaggerating .
um , so ... i don &apos;t want to spoil any surprises ,
but , uh , if you had to guess ,
what -- what would you say we &apos;re doing today ?
yeah , let &apos;s just see if you pick what we have planned .
let &apos;s see .
oh , my god .
is it that farm in oxnard
where cam and lily and i went strawberry @-@ picking ?
we had the most wonderful --
sorry , but you are just so great at this game .
but it &apos;s not strawberry season , so it can &apos;t be that .
which is exactly why we didn &apos;t pick that .
okay , so ... guess again .
wait -- do i smell the ocean ?
are you taking me to that fabulous carlton &apos;s on the beach ?
they have the most --
well , we &apos;re not making any promises ,
but that would be a pretty good guess .
if they weren &apos;t closed for renovations .
damn it ! think , uncle mitchell .
it &apos;s getting a little warm in here .
do you mind if we crack a window ?
unless i &apos;ve already done that with my head .
we -- we need to stop for gas , okay ?
just keep your blindfold on , uncle mitchell .
okay .
fine . this is fine .
fill &apos; er up !
yes , ma &apos;am .
seriously ?
we can &apos;t just keep driving around .
we need to go somewhere .
focus , people . what does uncle mitchell like ?
i don &apos;t know . gay things , right ?
what &apos;s the gayest thing you can think of ?
he &apos;s married to it .
hey , look .
everybody loves stars . we could take him on a tour .
driving around looking at houses
isn &apos;t much of a birthday fun day ?
we need more time .
let &apos;s knock him out .
charlize theron , harrison ford , halle berry ...
none of these seem very uncle mitchell .
what does uncle mitchell like ?
gay things .
then here &apos;s the mother lode .
barbra streisand ! perfect !
okay , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
how do we know these maps are real ?
you think i built this whole business on fake maps ?
what business ? you got a sign and a lawn chair .
can we wrap this up ? i might still have a cat to feed .
phil must have taken 100 pictures of me on the beach
just to get one shot of the topless women behind me .
there were topless women behind you ?
here you go . i &apos;ll just take this when you &apos;re ready .
oh , okay . thank you .
so , what do you two have planned for the rest of today ?
nothing ... really .
but if you need to wind it up , it &apos;s --
nah . we &apos;re good .
yeah , good . good .
do you guys , uh , you have any fun trips planned or ...
well , i was planning on visiting the restroom ,
and if all goes well , then maybe spain in april .
adios , amigo .
i vaya con dios !
you want to keep that hand , amigo ?
and france was just beautiful .
i hadn &apos;t been there since d @-@ day .
took me the same amount of time
to get across that beach , though .
you were in the service ?
yeah , but different war .
oh , korea . me too .
no , next war . keep going .
anybody want some cheese ?
not me . gums up the old ticker .
jay knows about that .
no idea . love the stuff .
just be careful with the almonds .
you may break the denture .
uh , it &apos;s not a denture . it &apos;s an implant .
how many times have we been over this ?
you forget stuff , too , huh ?
i never forget anything .
when we park at the mall , we have to take a picture .
jay , gloria tells me you have kids from your first marriage .
so does marty .
yeah . my oldest is , uh , 66 .
was . she passed last year .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
well , that &apos;s young . what was it ?
natural causes .
i blame most of it on stress .
so much more pressure than there was years ago .
back in our day --
different day . not the same day .
actually more your dead daughter &apos;s day .
may she rest in peace .
mom , we need to talk .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be watching the kids .
wesley is a bad influence on joe .
he &apos;s rude and disrespectful ,
and i think you should nip this friendship in the bud .
he made fun of your mustache , didn &apos;t he ?
what kind of 4 @-@ year @-@ old knows the word &quot; wispy &quot; ?
manny , look at me .
this close , and i still couldn &apos;t see it .
it &apos;s just for a little while longer , okay ?
fine .
but if they mess with me , i &apos;m gonna mess with them .
how many times a night do you have to get up to pee ?
i &apos;m up to four or five .
not me , old @-@ timer . twice tops .
once last month , i even slept through the night .
now , i &apos;m gonna refresh this
&apos;cause i got nothing to worry about .
i &apos;m literally in a pissing contest
with the son of a bitch .
why are we eating off the good china ?
because we &apos;re having company for lunch .
who &apos;s coming ?
okay , i invited monte and his family from upstairs .
what ? ! why ? !
because a daddy can tell when his little girl has a crush .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
hey , lily , where are you going ?
look , i want you to be able to talk to me
about this kind of stuff .
it &apos;s completely natural and healthy
to have feelings for someone .
and you know what ? i think he likes you , too .
you just have to draw him out , you know ?
flirt a little .
how ?
uh , well , you just sit down in front of him ,
look him straight in the eye , put a big smile on your face ,
and ask him some questions ,
like , &quot; so , do you have any hobbies ?
is canada really as beautiful as they say it is ?
are you a fan of the bacon ? &quot;
why are you blinking like that ?
well , because i &apos;m sending him signals .
okay , what else ?
definitely compliment him on his outfit ,
laugh at his jokes .
what if they aren &apos;t funny ?
oh , honey , the cute ones rarely are .
god doesn &apos;t give with both hands .
okay , do not have a heart attack ,
but when you take off your blindfold ,
you will be standing in front of none other
than the legendary superstar ...
who ?
the one and only ...
who ?
ms. barbra streisand--
oh , my !
&apos;s house .
oh , are you serious ? she actually lives here ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
dude , look . her gate is open .
we should get a picture of you in her driveway .
how awesome of a birthday fun day gift would that be ?
okay . you know what ? pepper would die .
he loved &quot; yentl &quot; so much , he had a second bar mitzvah .
okay , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s do it .
okay , right in front of the house .
yeah . this is fantastic .
* pepper , can you hear me ? *
* pepper , can you see me ? *
* pepper , i am standing in the driveway *
excuse me . can i help you ?
i &apos;m so sorry . we were just --
oh , my god . you &apos;re ray liotta .
he really is a big fan .
he even knows the name of her gardener .
&quot; goodfellas &quot; ?
&quot; something wild &quot; ?
&quot; field of dreams &quot; ?
never seen it .
okay , we &apos;re really not that old .
look , ray liotta is a very fine actor ,
and we have taken up enough of his time .
stop saying my full name
like you have to keep telling them who i am .
so , wait -- you live with barbra streisand ?
y @-@ y @-@ you got the map .
she lived here for about 2 months 15 years ago .
you think the bastards would update these things
to reflect the current movie @-@ star owners .
thank you . come on , kids .
we &apos;re very sorry to have bothered you .
no , no , no . i don &apos;t want you to leave empty @-@ handed .
come on in for a selfie .
all right . um ... here . o @-@ okay .
when you see my movies later ,
you &apos;re gonna realize that this is a special moment .
come on . and &quot; cheeeeese &quot; !
see ? that &apos;s an old actor &apos;s trick for a perfect smile .
except you and i are smiling . you guys aren &apos;t smiling .
w @-@ what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s not you , mr. liotta .
we just really feel like we let our uncle down .
we were supposed to plan a special day for his birthday ,
and we totally flaked .
we &apos;re so sorry .
we tried to figure out where to take you ,
and we know how much you love barbra streisand .
you always give us the most awesome gifts .
we suck .
don &apos;t say that .
i kind of figured you didn &apos;t have anything
by the second verse of the omelet dance .
hey , i &apos;ve had no training .
but then i saw how hard you were trying to make me happy ,
and i just love hanging out with you guys .
plus , i did get to meet ray lio-- ray .
you &apos;re also gonna meet barbra .
what ? no .
i &apos;ve been meaning to go by her house anyway .
i &apos;ve got a bunch of her mail .
oh , you don &apos;t have to do that .
no , no , no , no .
you remind me of --
of someone that i loved when i was a kid .
i had a funny uncle , too .
this is so nice of you .
well , i must admit ,
i @-@ i have a little bit of an ulterior motive .
i think lily has a giant crush on your little guy .
i kind of wanted to set them up .
i know -- i &apos;m a hopeless romantic .
oh ! that &apos;s so cute !
i remember my first crush . it was at summer camp .
i lived in toronto , and he was from edmonton ,
so it was very star @-@ crossed .
just like our little romeo and juliet .
he was the first boy i ever loved .
billy macklin .
god . i haven &apos;t thought of him in years .
do you have any hobbies ?
well , i like rock climbing .
i collect pokemon --
i hear canada &apos;s nice .
do you like bacon ?
okay , you know what , i &apos;m just gonna --
after that summer , things got pretty rough .
dad died , mom started drinking .
it was a lot to handle .
i love your shirt . is it new ?
oh , i think this shirt &apos;s older than you are .
okay , lily , can i see you in the bedroom , please ?
older than i am -- oh , rob , you &apos;re killing me !
okay , we &apos;ll be right back .
and enough .
what are you doing out there ?
what you told me .
i think it &apos;s going pretty good .
i thought your crush was on monte .
you can &apos;t flirt with a grown man .
but you said --
no . it &apos;s not appropriate .
oh , no ! i &apos;m never talking to a boy ever again !
lily , you have nothing to be ashamed of .
if -- if anything , this is -- this is my fault .
i thought you meant monte , and i confused you .
can i ... tell you a little secret ?
no !
well , when i made a move on my first crush ,
it went way worse .
it was new year &apos;s eve , and i went to give him a kiss ,
and my tongue froze to his cheek .
why did it freeze ?
it was cold , and he was made out of bronze ,
and i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
what are you doing ?
marty said guys our age can &apos;t do 10 sit @-@ ups .
i don &apos;t remember saying it , but it sounds like me .
jay , may i speak with you for a moment ?
all right .
ah , crap !
uh , here . l @-@ let me help you .
i &apos;m going down !
vicky !
what is wrong with you today ?
i &apos;m sick of marty lumping me
into the same age category as him .
&quot; guys like us , &quot; &quot; back in our day . &quot;
i &apos;m a baby boomer , for god &apos;s sake .
i know all the words to &quot; light my fire . &quot;
jay , you have to stop thinking only about you .
yeah , i know , i know . i should think about joe .
no -- me !
do you know that vicky and i
are the oldest moms in the class -- by a lot ?
so ?
this might surprise you ,
but aging is also a big deal for women .
i need vicky to be my friend .
i feel out of place around all those young moms .
and if you don &apos;t like her husband ,
maybe she &apos;ll stop liking me .
gloria , i &apos;m trying , but it &apos;s --
at least you &apos;re not the oldest dad .
can &apos;t you enjoy that ?
when was the last time
that you were the young stud in the room ?
when i put mom in that nursing home .
that was quite a rush .
so , are you going to be nice ?
yes . he &apos;s not a bad guy .
and really , how much longer
am i gonna have to put up with him ?
ay , no , jay . don &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re going to live a long life .
not me ! grandpa out there !
he can hear you .
hear what ?
you were talking about my mustache again ?
no , manny . we love your mustache .
oh , hilarious .
tell me you like it now that i &apos;ve shaved it off !
black mother and white father , but i &apos;ve never met him .
that &apos;s a story that should be out there more --
white fathers who abandon their families .
what else ? what else ?
so , this is walter .
just as i took over for jeremy when his shift ended ,
he &apos;ll be taking over for me .
unless you &apos;re ready ?
i think we &apos;re still talking . but thanks .
walter ? could i ask you a quick question right over there ?
i &apos;ll be right back , too .
i just need a minute alone with my husband . thank you .
there is no way you are paying that bill .
it has been out there forever ,
and he hasn &apos;t even pretended to reach for his wallet .
this is torture , claire .
i &apos;ll pay anything to end it .
stay strong .
i &apos;m weak . you married a weak man !
give it to me . give it --
phil --
no ! walter ! walter !
walter ! d &apos;ohh !
okay . here &apos;s the thing .
we like hanging out -- - no , claire ! no !
i know what this is about .
tom , you should have paid the check . it &apos;s rude .
he &apos;s not rude . he &apos;s wonderful . i had to pay .
why ?
phil , don &apos;t you say another word !
ow ! see ? i told you .
what the hell is going on here ?
nothing .
phil ?
fine -- if you have to know
every last detail about my life ...
i lost a bet to tom in cabo . now i owe him five meals .
there -- we &apos;re done . - that &apos;s it .
why didn &apos;t you just say that ?
th-- there &apos;s no reason .
what ... was ... the bet ?
phil , i mean it -- don &apos;t say another word .
they &apos;re gonna figure it out , tom .
how could they figure out , phil ?
they &apos;re gonna figure it out .
we were drunk on margaritas , and we wanted to find out
whose wife would eat the most crickets .
what ? !
what ? !
doesn &apos;t seem like they were circling that , phil .
you were just g @-@ grabbing crickets
and sneaking them into our food ?
not live ones . they were roasted .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re disgusting people .
you &apos;re missing the silver lining here , honey .
i lost the bet .
so i didn &apos;t eat crickets ?
you ate three .
ohh ! lisa had six .
six ? !
you could &apos;ve won with four !
baby , baby , i couldn &apos;t take that chance .
i &apos;d like to give you two a little something to think about .
most of the food you eat is prepared by us .
or by our private chef .
but i @-@ i like where you &apos;re going .
next time you take a bite of a big , juicy burger
or dig into a bowl of spaghetti ,
there &apos;s gonna be an extra special ingredient in there ,
and it won &apos;t be love .
how many did you get this time ?
two crickets .
okay , this makes more sense .
barbra would never leave her gate wide open .
they &apos;re broken , okay ?
don &apos;t make me regret bringing you here .
hello ?
is barbra home ? it &apos;s ray liotta .
you know , from &quot; goodfellas . &quot;
&quot; something wild . &quot;
&quot; field of dreams . &quot;
oh , i know who he is . what &apos;s up , ray ?
barbra , i have some of your mail
from when you used to live over at cedarhurst .
and i have a friend here that would like --
just leave the mail by the gate . i &apos;ll send someone down .
o @-@ okay , but --
oh . there &apos;s more ?
uh , ms. streisand , hi . my -- my name is mitchell pritchett ,
and i have been a fan of yours since i can &apos;t even remember ,
and -- oh , your artistry and integrity
has inspired me my whole life , and i just --
i can &apos;t even believe i &apos;m talking to you right now .
please . i &apos;m just a regular person , like you .
i have people put on my pants one leg at a time .
that &apos;s so funny .
barbra , today is his birthday !
well , technically , it was three weeks ago .
all right , you &apos;re blowing it .
sorry .
you sound very sweet , mitchell .
i @-@ i was thinking maybe as a special treat , you could --
i &apos;m not singing into my gate , ray .
well , it was very nice to talk to you .
i did have a quick question about --
goodbye .
it &apos;s fine .
when i tell the story ,
it ends with her singing &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
oh , shoot . it &apos;s past 3 : 00 .
what &apos;s wrong ? you late for dinner ?
jay .
honey , it &apos;s okay . if we leave now , we --
no , no , i missed it .
what did you miss ?
it &apos;s fred and ginger week on tcm .
they &apos;re showing &quot; swing time . &quot; and i forgot to record it .
let me tell you about a little innovation called netflix .
you &apos;ll never miss another movie again .
really ?
hand to god .
you pick a film on your computer .
three days later , there &apos;s a disk in your mailbox .
you got to stay up with technology , marty .
wow . thanks .
can you believe he doesn &apos;t know about streaming ?
if i ever get that out of touch , kill me .
