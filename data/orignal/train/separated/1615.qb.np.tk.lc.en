arbiter is responsible for the death of jack .
justina marks works for arbiter .
you were having sex with your foster brother .
we &apos;re gonna fight this .
we can &apos;t because it &apos;s true .
is nick stratos in school today ?
i saw nick , and he seemed really weird .
you said you weren &apos;t going to surprise me .
nick &apos;s got a gun . we &apos;ve got to lock down this school now .
let &apos;s get everyone in the office .
get those blinds . i need this table
in front of this door right now .
let me in please . it ... it &apos;s mariana .
get down ! get down !
we swept the entire school .
no sign of the stratos kid anywhere .
so , where the hell is he ?
how do you know nick had a gun ?
we don &apos;t know that .
his father owns one , and it &apos;s missing , so ...
but that doesn &apos;t mean that nick took it .
he burned down the warehouse .
yeah , but do we know that for sure ?
why are you defending him ?
let ... everybody , let &apos;s just please be
nice to each other , shall we ?
so , did you talk to nick ?
i mean , he said he was looking for you .
yeah .
so , what did he say ?
was he upset about something , or ...
he saw me and mat in the garage last night .
doing what ?
mat told me that he wanted to get back together with me ,
but i told him no because i didn &apos;t want to hurt nick .
so , why &apos;d he freak out ?
because he saw us kiss goodbye .
who kisses goodbye , mariana ?
i ... i told nick that i wasn &apos;t getting back together with mat ,
but he didn &apos;t believe me .
yeah , i don &apos;t believe you either .
jesus , enough .
no , did you see the way they ran into each other &apos;s arms ?
whose side are you on ?
we &apos;re all on your side , honey .
why did that teacher have a gun ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s an idiot , that &apos;s why .
what happened to him ?
he was ... he was arrested .
why were you in a 7th grade classroom ?
uh , well we ... we were just in the hallway talking
when everything went down .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;d come here ... nick , do you ?
no , no . absolutely not .
we &apos;ve got the entire san diego p.d. out there looking for him .
they &apos;re gonna find him very soon , okay ?
so , in the meantime , we &apos;ll just stay put .
all right ? sit tight .
keep all the doors locked just so we feel safe ,
and i really don &apos;t want any of you guys
on your phones or computers , please .
why not ?
because there &apos;s gonna be a lot of gossip
and misinformation out there ,
and i don &apos;t want any of you to be a part of it .
and you know what ? just so you &apos;re not tempted ,
why don &apos;t you give me your phones
and go upstairs and get your computers , please .
no , what are we gonna do without our phones ?
read a book .
yeah , we read books on our phones .
jesus , let &apos;s go .
can we play computer games ?
if you can somehow manage
to play them without computers , knock yourself out .
mine &apos;s broken anyway . i dropped it in the toilet .
post @-@ flush .
you &apos;re supposed to put it in a bag of rice .
got it . thank you .
you guys , before you all head up to your rooms ,
we &apos;re probably all still in some shock ,
so if feelings come up later ,
which i &apos;m sure they probably will ,
i want us to talk about it , okay ?
no ... no shutting down .
and to that end , no closed doors .
all right ? i want all door open , please .
even the bathroom doors ?
no , mariana , you can close those for privacy .
now go ahead upstairs . bring down your computers .
so , do you want to ...
no . no , not right now , please .
talk later .
well , can i get my keyboard from the garage ?
yes , b , but i locked it ,
so please make sure that you re @-@ lock it behind you .
you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
you really think it &apos;s necessary
to take their phones and computers ?
what if nick tries to get in touch
with mariana or jesus ?
you don &apos;t think they would tell us ?
i &apos;m not gonna risk it .
plus , with everything that &apos;s going around on fost and found .
how did justina even find out about ...
she didn &apos;t . she posted it ,
and just assumed correctly , unfortunately .
oh , what are we gonna do ?
there &apos;s not much we can do
with everyone in the house right now , so ...
i do want to let you know that i ...
i asked for a car to be stationed outside tonight , okay ?
so , you do think that he &apos;s gonna show up here ...
probably not .
but he is unstable ,
and i want us to be prepared for anything .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
look , stef ... stef said i could come up .
i hope ... i hope it &apos;s okay .
yeah .
i heard about the lockdown .
how you doing ?
fine .
you been on fost and found lately ?
yeah .
so , you know what people have been sayin &apos; ?
what have people been saying ?
y &apos;all do know there &apos;s a drought going on , right ?
we shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
we &apos;re not even supposed to be on our computers .
our computers . they didn &apos;t say anything about a.j. &apos; s .
无效的用户名或密码
sorry .
i can &apos;t get in .
i figured .
this is not fair .
we created fost and found .
justina has no right to lock us out .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not okay .
people are saying that you slept with your brother .
it &apos;s disgusting .
and justina &apos;s monitors aren &apos;t letting anyone on to defend you .
i should head back .
she &apos;s trying to destroy your reputation .
it &apos;s over , okay ? we lost fost and found .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
fine .
if you don &apos;t care .
do you mind ?
look , it &apos;s none of my business
or anyone else &apos;s ,
but whatever went down ...
i saw how brandon was with cortney at his birthday .
and i know nothing &apos;s goin &apos; on anymore .
i should &apos;ve believed you .
i &apos;m sorry .
um , i just can &apos;t really think straight right now .
i know .
but , when you can ...
i can &apos;t believe you guys
are making us watch a g @-@ rated film
starring a worm .
it &apos;s hard to find a movie without guns .
yes , or sex .
i love this movie .
yeah , you would .
okay , just because i didn &apos;t cut class to have sex in a car ...
mariana . you &apos;re grounded , by the way .
and that &apos;s different from this , how ?
so , am i , like , the only one in this house not having sex ?
you &apos;re 14 .
can we please watch the movie ?
yeah , who ate all the popcorn ?
you did !
you did !
i will make more .
no , no , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t leave me alone with them please !
no , no , no , you &apos;re on your own . i &apos;ll be right back .
brandon !
what ?
so , it true that you , you know , cut class to have sex ?
maybe .
and why do you assume that i &apos;m not a virgin ?
wyatt .
shut up !
okay , if you guys aren &apos;t gonna watch this ,
we can all just go up to bed .
it &apos;s up to you .
jack ?
i &apos;m still in the system .
nobody wants me .
aren &apos;t you dead ?
have moms said anything to you ?
no , you ?
i wish they &apos;d just get this over with .
and then what ?
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
yes , we did .
we didn &apos;t tell them , we didn &apos;t give them a chance .
chance to what ?
not adopt me .
callie , they wouldn &apos;t have ...
we don &apos;t know that .
they still can . they can reverse my adoption .
i looked into it . they can do it .
you have to stop thinking that nobody wants you .
this is different .
no , it &apos;s not .
callie , they &apos;re not gonna un @-@ adopt you .
they &apos;re not .
what &apos;s going on ?
we were just talking .
callie , go back to your room now .
are we gonna talk about this ?
we &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
no , no , cortney &apos;s moving tomorrow . i &apos;m helping her .
i don &apos;t care . you are not helping her .
she needs me . she doesn &apos;t have anyone else .
no one &apos;s leaving this house until nick is found .
you can &apos;t keep us locked up in here .
you do not want to push me on this , brandon .
hey , what &apos;s ... hey , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry , nothing . nothing , honey , okay ?
go back to bed .
okay ?
did you ever dream about your dad , after he died ?
yeah .
i remember this one where , um ...
i was over at his house sitting in his living room ,
we were watching a padres game .
and he asked me if i remembered the first time i saw snow ,
which was at a padres / cubs game in chicago
he took me to when i was six .
and i had said to him ,
&quot; why is there so much dust in the sky , daddy ? &quot;
yeah .
i had a dream about jack .
he said that he was still in the system
and that nobody wanted him .
do you ever think that dreams
are a way they try to talk to us ?
no , no , i don &apos;t know what i think .
you know , that day that we buried frank ,
i went outside into the car and sat ... sat in it to be alone ,
and talk to him and tell him i loved him ,
and that i forgave him .
and it started snow outside for real .
san diego , california .
you think it was like a sign ?
i , uh ...
i like to think it was frank
telling me that he loved me and forgave me , too , you know ?
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;ve had so much loss in your young life .
i really am .
i love you , you know that .
and i love you , too .
okay , get some sleep , baby .
everything okay ?
yeah , i think the rats are up in the attic again .
oh , great .
i &apos;ll have to check the traps tomorrow .
come to bed .
is that really necessary ?
i certainly hope not .
i , um ...
i found callie in brandon &apos;s room .
doing what ?
talking , or so they say .
you think something else was going on ?
no .
how are we ever going to be sure ?
you know , from now on , every time they &apos;re alone ,
are we gonna wonder and worry ?
you think we &apos;re partly to blame
for leaving them alone in idyllwild ?
no , mariana was with them ,
had no reason not to trust them .
sure as hell won &apos;t ever do that again .
is that fair ?
yeah , i think so .
honey , we &apos;re still a family .
i mean , honestly , what ... what are we gonna do ?
what can we do ?
well , we can &apos;t pretend like it didn &apos;t happen , yeah ?
honey , it &apos;s not happening now .
are you sure about that ?
i am , yes . i am .
well ... things are never gonna be the same .
so it &apos;s different .
we &apos;ll figure it out like we do everything else .
but none of the other kids need to know .
in fact , i think it &apos;s important that they don &apos;t ever .
well , i agree with you on that .
are you awake ?
yeah .
is it true ?
when ?
up in idyllwild .
you and brandon ...
yeah .
anything ?
i &apos;ve had a few calls from people
who think that they &apos;ve spotted nick in escondido .
oh , that &apos;s good .
you think we maybe can relax a little now ?
well , i think if he hasn &apos;t shown up by now ,
he &apos;s not going to .
especially in broad daylight .
but until they find him ,
i want to keep a car stationed out front .
what are you doing ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna check the rat traps .
you haven &apos;t heard them
scratching around up there again , have you ?
no . hey , why does brandon get to leave the house ?
he doesn &apos;t .
well , the mini &apos;s gone . does someone else have it ?
the hell ?
hey , momma ?
yeah .
do you think we could find out where jack &apos;s buried ?
i &apos;m sure we could .
do you want to visit his grave ?
i think so .
i remember mom saying something about him having an aunt .
i can try to find her phone number .
thanks .
so , apparently brandon got up this morning
to go help cortney move ,
after i distinctly forbade him from doing so .
wait , forbade ?
what are you doing ?
i am texting him to get his ass back home .
you took our phones .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; .
can i go to volleyball practice ?
it &apos;s at mission beach , so it &apos;s nowhere near school .
yeah , just one of us is gonna have to drive you .
i can do it .
awesome .
so we &apos;re safe now ?
we all just have to stay alert , please .
no one goes out alone
and make sure that the doors are locked always .
okay , but ...
you know , when can we have our phones and computers back ?
soon , love . soon .
sorry , um , just grabbing my toothbrush .
i can go downstairs .
it &apos;s okay .
so , you haven &apos;t said two words to me since i told you .
i mean , i don &apos;t really know what to say .
kind of makes me sick to think you and brandon
in the cabin , when i was asleep .
but i have no room to talk .
i had sex on a beach with wyatt at a school party .
at least you didn &apos;t cheat on anyone ,
except maybe the family in a way .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt anyone .
and it &apos;s totally over .
what did moms say ?
haven &apos;t yet .
well , at least we don &apos;t have to keep anymore secrets .
some secrets should be kept .
justina can &apos;t get away with what she &apos;s done .
we have to fight back .
how ?
there &apos;s got to be something .
i , um ... i took a picture of a check
arbiter made out to justina .
well , that proves that she works for them .
i mean , and it makes her liable for jack &apos;s death .
i mean , at least ethically .
this could really hurt her .
but how do we get it out there ?
it &apos;s not like we can just post it on fost &amp; found .
well , we can &apos;t , but ... justina can .
hello ?
hi , is this linda dawson ?
yes .
hi , my name is lena adams foster ,
um , and my son , jude ,
was friends with your nephew , jack .
hello ?
i &apos;m here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
um ... anyway ,
my son would like to visit jack &apos;s grave
if ... if you would be kind enough
to tell us know where he &apos;s buried .
look , they called me to say they cremated the body
and i could pick up the ashes ,
but it would cost me $ 400
and , well , i hardly knew the kid .
i ain &apos;t seen him since he was a baby
and i wasn &apos;t close to my sister .
i just don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t got that kind of money right now .
i don &apos;t know what they done with him .
i &apos;m sorry .
honey ?
honey , are you up there ?
yeah !
oh !
sorry , sorry .
did you find anything ?
no .
the rat traps are empty .
there aren &apos;t any droppings . i mean ,
i guess it could have been the wind .
hey , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
do you know what the coroner does
with remains that aren &apos;t claimed ?
well , after a certain time , they bury &apos; em .
where ?
uh , i don &apos;t know , a mass grave somewhere .
why ?
well , i was talking to jude about , you know ,
trying to find some place where ...
and here i thought moving wasn &apos;t fun .
well , now that we don &apos;t have to worry about
eddie walking in on us .
yeah , now all we have to do is worry about mason .
i ... i didn &apos;t mean that in a bad way .
i know .
he &apos;s a great kid .
so what &apos;s , uh , going on with you ?
what do you mean ?
well , when we were having sex ,
you seemed a little bit distracted .
oh , so you didn &apos;t , uh ...
did you not ...
no , i did .
you just , um , didn &apos;t really seem as with me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i ... i just think that , um ...
is it nick ?
you must be worried with him still out there .
oh , no , i mean , they probably found him by now .
that must &apos;ve been scary , the whole lockdown .
yeah .
there you are .
oh , my god .
so where is everyone ?
um , lena and jude went to drop jesus at practice
and stef &apos;s out somewhere .
hello , my name &apos;s andrew . how can i help you ?
hi , my name &apos;s justina marks .
i &apos;m the chief admin officer on fost &amp; found ,
and i was hacked and i lost all my info , including my passwords ,
so i can &apos;t get into my domain .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
uh , i can send a link to reset your password ,
i just need to ask you a few security questions .
great .
mother &apos;s maiden name ?
wimberley .
place of birth ?
evanston , illinois .
no .
no ? um ...
are you sure ? i mean , that &apos;s where i was born .
oh , not you , your mother &apos;s place of birth .
oh , right , sorry .
uh , yeah , it &apos;s piggott , arkansas .
great . last question , favorite pet &apos;s name ?
um ... uh , sorry , i have so many pets .
oh yeah , what do you have ?
um , i have a cat and a dog , um ...
i have a bird , um , a fish .
um , and a snake .
you have a snake ?
yep .
buttons .
sorry , not the snake .
髯毛小猎狗
the schnoodle .
aww . what &apos;s your snake &apos;s name ?
snakey .
so cute .
okay , i &apos;ll send the link to your email , jmarks @ jmi.vox.
actually , um , no ,
just &apos; cause i was hacked ,
could you send it to my assistant &apos;s email ?
it &apos;s jp123 @ mymail.vox.
okay , will do .
great , thank you so much .
uh @-@ huh .
snakey the snake ?
i don &apos;t know what you name a snake , okay ?
you are pretty adorable when you &apos;re under pressure .
okay , try to control yourselves until i do this ,
then i &apos;ll leave you alone .
what exactly are you doing , and am i gonna get arrested
for letting you hack somebody on my computer ?
we &apos;re not hacking anyone .
we &apos;re simply re @-@ routing all of the traffic from fost &amp; found
to a website called justice for jack .
i made up the name .
of course , it &apos;s not as good as snakey the snake .
and what &apos;s on justice for jack ?
a copy of the check that arbiter wrote to justina .
you know , the for @-@ profit organization
that had jack placed with pearson
and got him killed .
and how &apos;d you get this check ?
i would rather not say .
what if they trace this back to you guys ?
they won &apos;t . i &apos;m using an anonymizer .
and we &apos;re gonna send the link
to every lawmaker in san diego county and sacramento
to kill justina &apos;s bill .
all right .
all i have to do is press &quot; return . &quot;
do it .
so now what ?
now we wait and see .
well , i &apos;m exhausted .
i &apos;m gonna try to take a nap .
hey , thank you .
no problem .
how &apos;d you find me ?
the address from your desk .
i can &apos;t believe you went through my things .
i can &apos;t believe that you blatantly disobeyed me .
disobeyed ? i &apos;m not a kid anymore .
18 does not make you an adult , brandon .
i can vote .
any idiot can vote .
and as long as you are eating my food under my roof ,
you will obey my rules .
she wasn &apos;t adopted yet .
okay , i &apos;m gonna not talking about this here .
no , mom , i &apos;m sorry . we made a mistake .
but we are not real brother and sister .
oh , well , what about jesus and mariana ?
are they not your real brother and sister ?
no , no , that &apos;s different . we grew up together .
callie &apos;s only been living with us for like a year .
okay , i &apos;m not gonna listen to this , b.
right , &apos; cause you never listen .
okay .
just like when i try to tell you that i was in love with callie ,
you took out a restraining order .
yes , which you apparently violated several times .
did you not ...
this is why we don &apos;t tell you anything ,
because we knew you would never understand .
what &apos;s to understand , brandon ?
that you had sex with your foster sister ?
doesn &apos;t matter that she wasn &apos;t adopted yet .
it was wrong .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t come to us , because it was wrong .
you knew it and you were scared .
yeah , we were scared .
yeah .
we were scared to hurt the family .
oh , come on .
we gave up everything we felt for each other to protect you .
you deceived us . you deceived us , brandon .
there is no excuse for that .
and i hold you mostly responsible
because callie was vulnerable
and you , of all people , should have known better .
now , go get the rest of your stuff and get home , please .
you know , okay .
i take full responsibility .
for everything .
but i &apos;m not coming home .
okay . well , that &apos;s great .
then what are you gonna do , b ?
are you gonna go live with your dad again ?
that went really well the first time .
no , mom , i &apos;m gonna live here with cortney .
you might not think i &apos;m an adult yet ,
but legally , i can live wherever i want .
okay .
well , good luck with that .
don &apos;t scream , don &apos;t scream .
don &apos;t scream . okay ? just don &apos;t be scared .
don &apos;t be scared . i just wanna talk to you .
i &apos;ve been waiting to talk to you ,
so , uh , just , um ...
a.j. , is mike here ?
uh , no .
uh , i just ... i borrowed his car .
and i should be going
because he actually has to get to work tonight .
so i &apos;ll talk to you later ?
i hope you weren &apos;t on fost and found .
why ?
because we took your computers away for a reason .
what &apos;s in there ?
jack &apos;s ashes .
i need you to understand why .
okay ?
why ... why i can &apos;t , um ... why i can &apos;t because ...
there &apos;s too many voices in my head .
i can &apos;t , uh , think straight
because they won &apos;t stop talking .
and i hate it , and i hate everything .
i hate myself , and i ... i hate you .
you know ? i hate you .
what are you going to do with them ?
i ... i don &apos;t know .
do you think we could bury them under frankie &apos;s tree ?
jude ...
oh , no , that &apos;s okay .
um , i think that would be a lovely idea , honey .
hey , where have you been ?
uh , do you think you guys could give us a minute alone , please ?
sure .
okay .
what &apos;s the matter ?
apparently , brandon has decided
that he &apos;s moving in with cortney .
did you go over there ?
stef ?
i need to do something
to make the hurt go away .
you know , i can still hear the snap of his belt .
snap .
i would beg him not to hit me ,
and you know what he would say ?
he would say , &quot; this is gonna hurt me
a lot more than it &apos;s gonna hurt you . &quot;
i mean , what ?
he humiliated me ...
like you did .
please , don &apos;t hurt me .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
no , nick , don &apos;t .
were you scared during the lockdown ?
yeah . were you ?
i texted connor .
i mean , that &apos;s okay .
i miss him .
i know .
i miss jack , too .
why do bad things keep happening ?
nick , don &apos;t .
please , don &apos;t hurt yourself .
why ? why , huh ?
i &apos;m all alone , i have no one .
you have me .
no , i don &apos;t .
yes , you do .
you have me .
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
yes , you can . you can .
you just have to put the gun down .
what did you expect ?
you practically dragged him out of his girlfriend &apos;s bed .
he was embarrassed .
he should have been .
i hope it &apos;s brandon .
he has a key .
hey , look , look , look , i &apos;m still wearing your necklace .
why i be wearing it if i didn &apos;t want to be with you ?
what about mat , huh ? you don &apos;t love him ?
no , i ... i don &apos;t .
i love you .
hey .
hi , stef .
is mariana home ?
uh , yeah , she is .
i just want to check in after yesterday ,
see if she &apos;s okay .
um , sure .
she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s upstairs in her room .
go ahead .
thanks .
at least he &apos;s not in the system anymore .
i &apos;m sorry about what i said ,
that you lie about a lot of things .
i know it &apos;s not true .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not too late . okay ? i promise ,
we can still be together .
please , don &apos;t hurt yourself .
mat , don &apos;t go in there .
go get stef . go get stef .
well , i burned down the warehouse ,
so , they &apos;re gonna send me to jail anyway .
your dad wouldn &apos;t let that happen .
he doesn &apos;t care about me !
he doesn &apos;t ... he doesn &apos;t care about me .
okay ? i ... i can &apos;t ...
i need it to stop .
it will stop if we &apos;re together .
but we can &apos;t be together if you hurt yourself .
so please ... don &apos;t leave me alone .
don &apos;t break my heart .
i need you .
please , just ... just ... just come sit with me .
nick &apos;s in there .
go in there .
mariana .
okay , it &apos;s okay now , nick , it &apos;s all over .
mariana , come with me .
no , no , no , let her come with me
and you &apos;re gonna be fine .
just let her come with me . it &apos;s gonna be all over .
you okay ?
i &apos;m okay .
go find momma . go .
okay .
you go find momma .
gonna be okay now , nick .
it &apos;s all over , okay ? it &apos;s all over .
nick !
hey . are you okay ?
i thought he was gonna shoot me .
and then he put the gun to his head .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what ... what if he shot himself ,
like , right here in my room ?
i mean , how did you ...
what did you say to him ?
i ... i don &apos;t know . i ...
i just kept talking .
and then he cried in my arms .
he &apos;s so sad .
come here .
you &apos;re okay .
it &apos;s okay .
i want to get an alarm .
i want to get bars on the windows .
whatever it takes to make us safe .
honey , we are fine . okay ? we &apos;re fine .
what are we gonna to do about callie ?
now you have a home .
