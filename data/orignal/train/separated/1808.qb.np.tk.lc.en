it &apos;s impossible to describe the panic
that comes over you when you &apos;re a surgeon
and your pager goes off in the middle of the night .
your heart starts to race .
please don &apos;t be mine .
don &apos;t be mine .
your mind freezes .
don &apos;t be mine .
your fingers go numb .
not mine .
wake up .
oh ! i &apos;m up .
they &apos;re paging you .
you &apos;re invested .
i &apos;m sleeping !
they &apos;re someone &apos;s mom ,
someone &apos;s dad , someone &apos;s kid ,
and now it &apos;s on you ,
because that someone &apos;s life is now in your hands .
robbins , karev &apos;s with your patient in trauma two .
torres , come with me .
we have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old female .
she fell off the roof of her house .
now i think that we should--
she &apos;s gonna be okay , right ?
please , i just need to know .
is she gonna be okay ?
and this is her mother .
mrs. boyd ,
i need to bring dr. torres up to speed right now , okay ?
she &apos;s never been in any accident before .
she &apos;s never even broken any bones .
oh , you paged me here at 4 : 00 a.m.
for a couple of broken bones ?
more like 50 .
as surgeons ,
we &apos;re always invested in our patients .
laura young , 30 weeks pregnant .
car accident. head c.t.
showed a subdural .
shepherd &apos;s coming in . baby &apos;s in distress .
o.b. &apos; s on its way .
oh , it hurts . it really hurts .
okay , wait . hold on . stop . move the wand up .
what ?
okay , baby &apos;s brain is hemorrhaging .
she needs a crash &quot; c &quot; while shepherd handles the bleed .
get ready to grab a rail and start running .
but when your patient &apos;s a child ...
get another unit of packed cells , meet me in the o.r.
right away .
you &apos;re not just invested ...
oh. we need the o.r.
you &apos;re responsible ...
well , we need it , too . we &apos;re already on our way .
there &apos;s only one o.r. prepped this time of night .
which is why we need it .
mine &apos;s got a subdural .
50 broken bones .
stroke in the womb !
all right , get another o.r. ready now .
responsible for whether or not that child survives ,
has a future .
and that &apos;s enough to terrify anyone .
爱的代价
what &apos;s her status ?
mom &apos;s heart rate and , b.p. has been fluctuating ,
but she &apos;s ready for you .
all right , let &apos;s prep her for a craniotomy .
apgar &apos;s only 4 .
we need to get to the nicu now .
all right , drain &apos;s in a good position .
yeah , she &apos;s breathing over the vent .
maybe we should consider extubating her ?
yeah , but watch for apneic episodes ,
and keep an eye out for her c.b.c.
there &apos;s still too much blood draining from her head .
what time is it , karev ?
half past 8 : 00 .
half past 8 : 00 . i &apos;ve already been awake for 5 hours ,
and my day hasn &apos;t even started .
rough way to start your morning .
a stroke before you &apos;re even born--
rough way to start a life .
yeah .
hey , i brought you some coffee .
oh , you already have one .
oh , no .
i want your coffee . i need your coffee .
okay , when you see cristina , she is gonna be mad .
she &apos;s gonna be mad at me for not paging her in here last night ,
possibly mad at you for not waking her up either .
now i am handling this . do not engage her .
do not provoke her . simply ignore her , all right ?
oh , that &apos;s your plan--ignore the scalpel @-@ hungry animal ?
yep , until i come up with something better .
hmm .
okay , i know this is the first time
on a peds rotation with me for some of you .
not for others .
but i wanted you to understand that i run my peds unit
a little differently than you may be used to .
this is not general surgery in miniature .
these are the tiny humans . these are children .
they believe in magic . they play pretend .
there is fairy dust in their i.v. bags .
they hope and they cross their fingers and they make wishes .
and that makes them more resilient than adults .
they recover faster , survive worse . they believe .
in peds , we have ...
miracles and magic .
in peds , anything is possible .
morning , dr. robbins .
good morning , dr. wallace .
i see that you &apos;ve already introduced yourself to mr. and mrs. boyd .
yes . reminds me of hillary at that age .
such an overachiever .
dr. yang , why don &apos;t you present ?
yeah .
excuse me , little ... doctor boy .
hillary boyd , 15 years old , fell off the roof of her house .
52 acute fractures were diagnosed
when she was admitted last night .
an intricate and extremely challenging
o.r.i.f. surgery
was performed by dr. torres and dr. hunt
this morning before rounds .
thank you , dr. yang .
if she fares well enough today , i &apos;d like
to go in tomorrow to repair her subtrochanteric fracture next .
can anyone tell me
the proper dosage of ceftriaxone for a pediatric patient ?
50 milligrams per kilogram per day .
mm @-@ hmm .
and , dr. wallace , can you tell me
the proper dose for this patient if she were 42 kilograms ?
2.1 grams per day ...
if you carry the decimal .
okay , who &apos;s presenting ?
i am , dr. robbins .
proceed .
wallace anderson ... 10 years old--almost 11
been here for 7 months .
in and out over the past two years .
suffers from short gut syndrome ,
which means he can &apos;t properly absorb nutrition .
exactly . dr. percy ?
15 intestinal surgeries to date ,
plus a bowel lengthening procedure ,
which helped for a while ,
but recently , he &apos;s had to go back to being fed through t.p.n.
yum .
how &apos;d he do this morning ?
we covered some pretty advanced algebraic conversions .
dr. robbins helps me with my math and science homework
by letting me go on rounds .
fascinating .
we try to keep his life as normal as we can ,
even living in a hospital .
but i can skip my homework on friday , right ,
since it &apos;s my birthday ?
since it &apos;s your birthday .
what about dr. robbins ? it is her birthday , too .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t skip my homework , wallace ,
but i can come celebrate with you like i promised .
dr. robbins .
we &apos;ve requested a meeting later with chief webber
and a representative from the hospital board .
and we &apos;d like you there , too .
all right .
so they didn &apos;t give you any indication
as to what this meeting was about ?
you know as much as i do .
you treated their son , right ?
well , you better pray that you didn &apos;t do something to piss them off .
god knows that this hospital can &apos;t afford
another misstep right now .
it &apos;s a pleasure to see you again , paul .
bethany , you look lovely .
we didn &apos;t think wallace would see his 9th birthday ,
let alone his 10th .
and now this week , his 11th .
which is why we &apos;d like to offer
seattle grace mercy west &apos;s peds program a gift
of $ 25 million .
$ 25 million ?
half to go to research to continue searching for a cure
for wallace &apos;s condition ,
and half to the hospital itself .
uh ... i ...
i mean ...
$ 25 million ?
happy birthday , arizona .
i always knew that wallace &apos;s parents were wealthy ,
but not $ 25 @-@ million wealthy.i mean ,
that &apos;s &quot; libraries named after you &quot; kind of money ,
&quot; saved babies in africa and has dinner
at the white house regularly &quot; type money .
people don &apos;t give me that kind of money .
you have an unfair advantage . you work with children .
oatmeal , side of fruit , wheat toast , hold the butter .
thank you .
you know what ? that money is gonna make such a difference
for so many patients . it &apos;s--it &apos;s really amazing .
maybe i should start doing more cleft @-@ palate kids .
everyone &apos;s a sucker for those .
cheese omelet , extra butter , cinnamon toast , crispy bacon .
mine !
$ 25 million is pretty cool , right ?
yeah .
best birthday gift ever .
birthday gift ?
yeah .
well , &apos; c @-@ cause the money &apos;s a gift .
i mean , technically it &apos;s for the hospital ,
not arizona ,
but since your birthday &apos;s on friday
um ... how does little grey know about your birthday
and i don &apos;t ?
birthdays are just days like any other days .
i don &apos;t like them . don &apos;t celebrate them .
no big deal . $ 25 million ?
that &apos;s a big deal .
crap . i &apos;m gonna be late . i will see you there .
okay , she &apos;s downplaying it , right ?
i &apos;m her girlfriend .
i have to do something for her birthday , right ?
yes .
no .
of course you do .
oh ! oh ! a @-@ a surprise party .
whoa , whoa . bad idea .
surprise parties are hostile .
they &apos;re dark .
people jump out and scream at you .
they never come to any good .
karev .
good morning , chief .
uh , when you &apos;re free , come find me .
what &apos;s that all about ?
he fired me . and i refused to be fired .
so i say hello to him every morning ,
and he says not a word .
sounds familiar .
you haven &apos;t heard from stevens ?
not a word .
they &apos;ll come around when they come around .
chief , you need me ?
uh , i wish i didn &apos;t have to saddle you with this , karev , but
what is all this ?
as stevens left no forwarding address ,
and as you are officially her next of kin ,
this is her unpaid balance of her medical bills .
unpaid balance ? i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
we work here at the hospital .
yeah , and insurance doesn &apos;t take care of everything .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but accounting &apos;s been pressuring me since the merger ,
and i can &apos;t ignore it any longer .
what &apos;s yours in for ?
mm , delivered her yesterday .
stroked out at 10 weeks premature .
yours ?
born with its insides on the outside .
two days post @-@ op .
resilient little guy .
more bleeding overnight .
should we try f.f.p. ?
at this point , we should try anything .
get me a repeat m.r.i. and page me
if she becomes bradycardic or starts having apnea spells .
i &apos;ll be on rounds .
um , i was picking up some labs from dr. bailey ,
and i saw that you had these waiting .
thought i &apos;d bring &apos; em by , save you the trip .
thanks .
are you okay ?
i overheard a little bit of your conversation with the chief .
i &apos;m trying to save a baby here . get outta my face .
got it .
is he still sleeping ?
no .
he had a bad night .
i can still go on rounds .
i feel better . just give me a second .
you know what ? how about if you just take a rest for now .
and then you can join me for evening rounds instead ?
okay .
he listens to you more than he does to me .
well , yeah. she &apos;s a doctor , mom .
and you &apos;re just ... well , a mom .
oh . okay .
well , how about you close your eyes
and you let me do what moms do , okay ?
bad dreams , bad dreams , go away .
good dreams , good dreams , here to stay .
bad dreams , bad dreams , go away .
good dreams , good dreams , here to stay .
you have to do it three times for it to work .
oops . one more .
he &apos;s had bad nights before , but i want to make sure
that we &apos;re not missing anything .
how &apos;s she doing ?
touch and go .
how &apos;s the baby ?
same .
any news from the family ?
no , i left a message. haven &apos;t heard back yet .
i.c.p. is elevated. b.p. won &apos;t stabilize .
uh , 100 mics of fentanyl , please .
laura ? laura , can you hear me ?
my baby . where &apos;s my baby ?
she &apos;s struggling , but she &apos;s hanging on .
can i see her ?
i &apos;m sorry. no. you &apos;re too unstable to move .
so is the baby .
i just want to hold her . mm @-@ hmm .
please . i want to hold my baby .
laura , i need you to stay calm , okay ? laura
just-- what if she dies before i get to hold her ?
she can &apos;t .
she can &apos;t go before she &apos;s ever even been held .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
push 10 of diazepam
and give me some supplemental 0 @-@ 2 , please .
crap . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1. it &apos;s her baby .
she &apos;s bradying down and she lost access .
i &apos;ll start cpap .
dr. robbins .
not right now .
i think you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
it &apos;s the x @-@ rays on wallace anderson .
all right , show me .
see ? he has dilated loops of bowel .
all right , flip .
flip .
damn it. damn it .
he has another bowel obstruction ,
and he &apos;s not compensating.okay.
i &apos;ve got this. go .
a nurse just checked that .
yeah , a nurse checked it ,
i &apos;m gonna check it ,
and three other people in the o.r. are gonna check it .
we &apos;re through .
honey , please let them do their jobs .
uh , mr. and mrs. boyd .
we thought that you should know that
hillary &apos;s tox screens from yesterday
show signs psilocybin in her bloodstream .
what does that mean ?
well , it means that when she fell from the roof ,
she was--
mushrooming .
yeah. magic mushrooms .
what ? hillary ?
mushrooms ?
oh , come on .
can everybody please chill out ?
what in god &apos;s name were you thinking ?
you know , i can &apos;t believe ...
you &apos;re a disappointment , young lady ,
a big , big , disappointment .
dad , please
okay , the last thing i am is a disappointment .
i get straight a &apos;s . i &apos;m on honor roll .
i run the student council .
i basically am the school paper ,
and i tutor kids with reading problems. okay ?
i &apos;m every parent &apos;s dream come true , including yours .
i was exploring the bounds of my consciousness
with the help of a mushroom .
i made a calculated risk going on that roof .
falling off ? well , that was a low @-@ probability event ,
and even low @-@ probability events occasionally occur ,
and this one did .
so , yeah , you &apos;re bummed i miscalculated
cause it reminds you of your own fallibility .
i &apos;m bummed , too .
let &apos;s just leave it at that .
cap refill is five seconds .
push one of epi .
it &apos;s not working. heart rate &apos;s down to the 60s .
starting compressions .
could i help ?
doubt it. at this rate ,
this kid &apos;s not gonna last more than an hour .
she &apos;s only 30 weeks. pretty young to survive .
so what , you &apos;re just gonna stand there and watch her die ?
mm , pretty much .
that sucks .
it is what it is. it &apos;s protocol .
beeping drives me nuts .
look , i mean--
the kid &apos;s gonna die. deal with it or get out .
hey there , girl .
i got you. yeah .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re not alone .
no , you &apos;re not. you &apos;re not alone .
wait. hold on .
are you saying you can &apos;t do more surgery on him ,
or you won &apos;t ?
it &apos;s not a question of if i can .
it &apos;s whether or not i should .
in my opinion , wallace isn &apos;t strong enough
to handle another operation .
but with surgery , how long would he have then ?
i ... i &apos;m not confident
that he &apos;ll even make it off the table .
but if he did , how long ?
i strongly advise against--
how long ?
maybe two months . i ...
i &apos;m s--i &apos;m sorry .
but the moment that we &apos;ve been fighting for two years ...
it &apos;s here .
so you need to prepare yourselves
and you need to prepare wallace .
you think i &apos;ve been pouring all this money into research
so that you could find a cure for some other kid ?
mr. anderson--
no .
you have to do this surgery .
mr. anderson , i &apos;m--
you buy our son two more months .
you buy him more time
so that we can buy him a cure .
i &apos;m sorry .
robbins .
these aren &apos;t people who hear the word no .
if they want surgery for their son ,
they &apos;ll get surgery for their son ,
whether or not you &apos;re the one to do it .
you &apos;ve been with this boy since day one .
i believe you can do this successfully .
don &apos;t walk away now
unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can &apos;t .
the surgery is a bad idea , chief .
but is it impossible ?
in your hands ... is it impossible ?
okay .
okay ?
okay , i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll try .
oh , is that the preemie ?
oh , yeah . i was just , uh ... well , i tried everything .
i just thought maybe somebody should hold her
before , you know , she ...
kangaroo .
what ?
the way you &apos;re holding the baby ,
it &apos;s called a kangaroo hold .
uh , there &apos;s been cases where the kangaroo
has helped babies thrive .
but look , karev , look at the numbers .
look at this .
heart rate &apos;s going up .
yeah , it is , and her temperature is normal .
karev , you may have just
kick @-@ started this baby &apos;s entire system .
just by holding her ?
take off your shirt .
what ? no. take off your shirt .
no , no .
just--the kangaroo hold ,
it &apos;s most effective when there &apos;s skin @-@ on @-@ skin contact .
it &apos;s usuallyhe mom , but , you know ,
you &apos;re gonna have to do .
i &apos;m not kidding. take off your shirt .
well , it looks like you used
pretty much every piece of hardware in the hospital .
yeah , it makes you think twice about mushrooming on a roof .
and the mouth on this one ?
if i talked to my parents like that--
oh , my father would &apos;ve ...
oh , you don &apos;t even want to know .
i had perfect grades , perfect record ,
and i said whatever i wanted , did whatever i wanted .
my parents couldn &apos;t do a thing about it .
want to hear about my childhood ?
no ? okay .
i &apos;ll just , uh , think about it quietly in my own head .
all right , nails in , everything &apos;s tight .
let &apos;s take a look .
fantastic .
end @-@ tidal c @-@ 0 @-@ 2 just dropped from 34 to 22 .
oh , come on. give me a break here , hillary .
she has a new murmur .
there &apos;s an air embolus in her heart .
all right , flood the field with saline .
give me the bone wax . page cardio
and set up a chest tray .
and put her in trendelenburg .
i can ... i can operate
no , no , we wait for cardio
and we try to find the source .
no , it &apos;ll only take 30 second .
it might take cardio half an hour to get here .
dr. yang
i &apos;ve done this before . i know what i &apos;m doing .
she could arrest at any moment .
dr. yang , no . end up the discussion .
see ? it &apos;s the skin @-@ to @-@ skin contact .
the baby can feel your warmth better ,
sense your heartbeat better . see that ?
the baby &apos;s own heart is picking up in response .
karev , what are you doing ?
he &apos;s saving a baby &apos;s life , that &apos;s what .
dr. bailey , i ... oh , no shirt .
he &apos;s wearing no shirt .
have you started to lactate yet ?
bailey made me .
is this the room for the calendar shoot ?
i was told it was downstairs .
yeah , all right .
everybody out .
let karev do what he &apos;s doing in private .
what is he doing exactly ?
out .
out .
this is ridiculous .
you &apos;re wasting all this time down here ,
when we should be dealing withi the heart problem directly .
we are following protoco and we can
find the source of the embolus this way .
screw it .
dr. yang , the patient is not coding ,
and you are not qualified to do this .
opening the left chest .
oh , yang , really ?
turn on the fluoro .
dr. ya .
will someone please step on the fluoro ?
or do you want me to go in blind ?
dr. yang , put down that scalpel !
thank you .
cristina !
scissors .
cristina !
cristina !
cardio &apos;s here , yang .
it &apos;s done . i &apos;m done .
air embolus out .
the patient was crashing .
she was not crashing .
it was a procedure i &apos;ve done before .
i handled it , and she &apos;s fine .
yeah , but what if she wasn &apos;t ?
you could &apos;ve lacerated her heart
or cut the phrenic nerve .
she could &apos;ve died on that table . what then ?
it would &apos;ve been your license .
all so you could prove what exactly ?
well , i did it to stabilize the patient .
you were just watching her vitals drop .
waitg for a c.t. surgeon
to take a more minimally invasive approach .
i could &apos;ve done a thoracotomy myself
if i had thought was indicated .
i &apos;ve been around the block once or twice .
you know i kinda ... i kind know what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m aware of it . i was just ...
you just thought ever--
you just thought you just thought
everything would be better if you took charge .
and you know i have to report this to the chief , right ?
at a time when he is scouring this place for people to fire .
well , he &apos;s not gonna fire me .
oh , --of course not ,
cause you &apos;re ... you &apos;re invincible .
no , he &apos;s not gonna fire me
because the last time that i did an open thoracotomy
for an embolus was with him in his o.r.
only he was giving me words of encouragement ,
not screaming in my ear .
for the record , you rock that in there .
hunt &apos;s just jealous he didn &apos;t do it himself .
shut up .
okay , you won &apos;t believe what just happened in the surgery
hey . you okay ?
tell me i &apos;m great .
what ?
i need for you to tell me that i &apos;m great .
you &apos;re great .
i mean really tell me ,
because i &apos;m about to go in on a surgery right now
that i &apos;m not sure i should be going in on ,
and i can &apos;t think like that , right ?
i can &apos;t go into the o.r. feeling like this .
so ... i need you to tell me i &apos;m great ,
and make me ... make me hear it .
you are great .
you ...
are ... great .
thank you .
hey there .
you ready to go ?
i was gonna take you to the o.r. myself .
i &apos;ve been here a while now , dr. robbins .
and ... i &apos;ve seen kids go home or go away .
like evan-- the kid from down the hall
with asthma last month .
he died the day before he was supposed to be discharged .
you &apos;re not evan .
and chloe--the heart girl ?
she was here for three weeks before she died .
no one says yore gonna die .
i &apos;ve been re for seven months .
i &apos;ve been here t longest of anyone on the floor ,
by double .
wallac
they say it &apos;s like going to sleep .
and maybe it is .
but what if i go to sleep ,
and i have nightmares ?
more traction , please .
damn it. the mesentery &apos;s really friable .
percy , a little help on the suction .
this is not a good idea .
this surgery-- not a good idea .
could we get a washcloth for dr. robbins , please ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
just take a moment .
thank you .
pick ups , please .
i left you messages .
i &apos;m sorry . i was in surgery .
there were complications .
i don &apos;t care , okay ?
i operated on wallace tonight even when i knew better .
and i keep retracing every step , every suture ,
and i keep going over it and over it--
he didn &apos;t make it ?
he did .
he &apos;s in recovery. that &apos;s not the point .
what i needed from you tonight was a little surrport for once ,
and you weren &apos;t here .
okay , you &apos;re scared ,
and so you &apos;re picking a fight , you get that , yeah ?
yeah. yeah. fine. whatever .
but i have helped you through crisis after crisis .
and once i thought that i could come here tonight ,
and i could get something-- it &apos;s done .
i have every right to be mad , cristina .
you would &apos;ve never pulled a stunt like that with another attending .
i seem to recall callie was there and don &apos;t stop me .
okay , guys , not now .
you took advantage of me
and you took advantage of our relationship .
oh , please. the kid was dying .
wait.what kid ? what happened ?
oh , so you didn &apos;t hear ?
no .
no , i didn &apos;t .
cristina--she performed an unauthorized
and unnecessary thoracotomy against my orders .
she what ?
i saved the patient &apos;s life .
wait. okay , so you were there , and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
i was going to , but you were all , &quot; tell me i &apos;m great . &quot;
so-- oh , so it &apos;s my fault that
yang went rogue on a child ?
no-- no , you know what ? it wasn &apos;t rogue .
it was brilliant .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
you know , i--i &apos;m done .
you got lucky today , cristina .
and you may think that you can
get away with whatever you want ,
but i am telling you , one of these days ,
that luck &apos;s gonna run out .
look ... what ?
oh , okay. so you &apos;re leaving , too ?
yes , because i have a patient .
bitches .
all right , start an epi drip now .
more irrigation. just keep it coming .
give me a babcock clamp .
clamp .
damn it . i need more light .
can somebody get me more light ?
pressure &apos;s dropping to 68 over 40. pulse is racing .
come on , wallace .
what the hell happened to the anderson boy ?
he &apos;s infective shock 。
his body was too unstable to handle the surgery ,
which is what i said in the first place .
you know , i can help .
no ! no , you can &apos;t .
because as long as you &apos;re standing
there breathing over my shoulder ,
i feel like i &apos;m operating on a stack of dollar bills--
$ 25 @-@ million @-@ dollar bills--
and what i need to be invested in right now is this kid .
so please get the hell out of my o.r. !
more suction now .
how &apos;d it go ?
damn it .
i &apos;ll let them know you did everything you could .
wait , dr. robbins ,
don &apos;t we have to tell the parents ,
let them know that he didn &apos;t make it ?
no .
what do you mean , no ?
i mean no .
i will not be speaking to wallace &apos;s parents .
mr. jennings and the chief will take care of that formality ,
because as far as they &apos;re concerned
and as far as the andersons will be concerned ,
i just killed their son .
i &apos;m a liability ,
because if they were to ask me the truth ,
i would tell them that i did just kill their son .
and they should sue , and i am responsible .
but that &apos;s not in the best interests of the hospital .
am i close ?
yeah , i think we &apos;re on the same page .
my luck will run out .
it has nothing to do with luck
he &apos;s being an ass .
you know what ? i rocked that embolus .
what ?
he cares about you .
so ?
so ? so maybe he &apos;s a little bit right .
i get it .
i mean , i &apos;m dying to get out of this bed and cut ,
but you did an unauthorized procedure in an o.r.
i mean , you &apos;re an amazing surgeon ,
but if anything had gone wrong , that would &apos;ve be your career .
i mean , he cares about your career .
he &apos;s in love with you .
i hate ... married , happy you .
go to work ,
and don &apos;t cut anybody open without permission .
you shoul &apos;ve seen yang in that surgery .
i mean she was fearless .
and you are hopeless .
she &apos;s completely out of your league .
oh , i &apos;m hopeless , huh ?
i &apos;m just ... stupid .
he &apos;s married , and have i mentioned , a total ass
to pretty much everyone at all times ?
karev ?
did you stay here all night ?
uh , yeah . i ... i guess i did .
go home , get some rest .
the nurse will take over for you .
no. uh , i--i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m good here .
well , you &apos;d be good in peds , you know that ?

i know . how lame is that ? it just--
hey , little pusher girl . i &apos;m hillary &apos;s doctor .
and now i have hillary &apos;s phone .
so i &apos;m gonna give this number to the police .
how lame is that ?
what the hell ?
okay. uh , i know you think you can do anything
and say anything and handle anything .
and that &apos;s , you know , almost true ,
except for the fact that you fell off a roof
cause you were so high that you , what ,
you thought you could fly ?
in surgery , you almost died of a heart complication
because your body is so strung out
from all the crap you &apos;ve been putting in it
that it almost shut down completely .
okay , that doesn &apos;t make you smarter than everyone else .
it makes you an idiot .
the only reason why you &apos;re alive is ...
you know , is &apos; cause you &apos;re lucky .
so just , you know , grow up .
surprise !
i ...
i ... um ...
i @-@ i ...
told you .
okay , in retrospect ,
i realize now that surprise parties are hostile ,
and this was a bad idea .
please stop crying . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry about the party .
wallace died .
and he &apos;s supposed to be turning 11 today ,
and instead , he &apos;s lying in a morgue .

but at least there &apos;s free booze , right ?

surprise parties never come to any good .
i think this party speaks for itself .
i don &apos;t get it .

was the surprise party that my parents threw .
i @-@ i @-@ i loved it so much .
how old were you at this party ?

that was incredibly hot in the o.r. yesterday .
very deeply hot. it was hot. you were hot .

i ... am , in fact , inebriated .
but that &apos;s legal , you know ?
and even if i wasn &apos;t , you &apos;re the rule breaker ,
which i think we established in surgery .
really , you think that was hot ?
would it be really , really bad if i just--
you know , &apos; cause of the the embolus thing
and you in general-- could i just ...
uh , no . i &apos;m involved .
