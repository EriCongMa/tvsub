divorce suits you .
your charms won &apos;t work on me , pascal .
not this time .
i have no intention of merging our companies .
what if i got you the one thing you &apos;ve always wanted ?
i have everything a man could want .
except victoria .
i sort of gave my parole officer your address .
he &apos;s this millennial computer genius from prison .
i have no intention of going anywhere .
yet this property belongs to me .
it &apos;s time to show our fathers what we &apos;re capable of .
care to join me ?
faking a pregnancy to force daniel into marriage .
your dirty , little secret is out .
i had to create a public break from the graysons .
what &apos;s &quot; twm &quot; ?
my mom said she never knew who wrote the letter .
it was european .
pascal is a part of this ?
yeah , i think he is .
addiction -- an impulse that , once indulged ,
is impossible to pacify .
even when starved , the hunger survives .
first the dolce &amp; gabbana .
and now george de la tour &apos;s &quot; the fortune teller &quot; ?
it &apos;s your favorite , no ?
at the met where it belongs .
i thought you &apos;d like to enjoy it for a month or two .
i cannot be bought -- especially by a man
whose reputation for romance is reckless .
the result of a lifetime of mistakes .
you don &apos;t know me , pascal .
or what i want .
a love that will always triumph over darkness .
a love that i would lay down my life for .
at least you &apos;ve moved on from the note to ...
other unsolvable riddles .
have you heard from aiden ?
no . and i don &apos;t expect to .
he &apos;s honoring what i wanted .
well , i &apos;ve been trying to do that , too .
i hacked into the lemarchal mainframe ,
but wading through every file
of europe &apos;s largest media conglomerate
for the letters &quot; twm &quot; is just gonna take eons .
it definitely can &apos;t be &quot; the white @-@ haired man , &quot; right ?
it fits , but ... i am pretty sure that
that nickname was a &quot; nol @-@ riginal . &quot;
well , i can &apos;t wait any longer .
what are you gonna do ?
the letter &apos;s not enough to incriminate the graysons ,
but pascal has a piece of the puzzle that i don &apos;t ,
and there may be more .
so if i can get close to him , gain access --
then you can finally finish the puzzle .
hey . working hard ?
the &quot; voulez &quot; gossip tip line
has pretty much become a pascal tracker .
does that mean emily &apos;s dropped off the radar ?
yeah . she &apos;s yesterday &apos;s news .
though i &apos;ll never forget what she did to you .
to us .
emily lied to our entire family , charlotte .
including you .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d just leave town ,
instead of staying here and making things harder for you .
which is why we &apos;re gonna return the favor
and go after her friends .
we ?
i don &apos;t know , daniel .
no , no , no , no . look , look , look , look .
you helped me figure out what dad was up to .
now we can put those skills to an even worthier cause .
okay .
but jack isn &apos;t involved in all this .
i want to keep it that way .
fine . porter &apos;s off the table .
okay . i &apos;ll see you later .
&quot; former hamptons royal stevie grayson
&quot; created her own drama at the opera
&quot; by arriving on the arm of her secret son ,
local tavern owner jack porter . &quot;
it &apos;s a great photo of us .
you &apos;re not upset ?
i assumed you wanted it released on your own terms .
it was .
i told the photographer .
i have seen how secrets are used as leverage .
and considering you &apos;re about to own grayson manor ,
the last thing i wanted to do
was give conrad or victoria any ammo .
i still can &apos;t understand
how you could be married to that monster .
conrad wasn &apos;t always so terrible .
we met on a blind date .
he was so relaxed and charming .
we ended up having such a great time .
we went to the airport and --
and took the first flight to anywhere .
you know , trying to picture him like that
is nearly impossible .
no , it didn &apos;t last long .
but he &apos;s not solely to blame .
you don &apos;t have to defend him .
i &apos;m not , jack .
you &apos;ve never seen me drunk .
and thank god you never will .
all i said was
&quot; the fortune teller &quot; is her favorite painting ,
and you had it designated on loan to her ?
i thought you knew victoria better than
to make grand gestures .
i thought you were a man who could keep his promises .
i am , but to erase your soiled past
from victoria &apos;s memory requires a slow burn .
just give it time .
well , don &apos;t waste mine .
make it happen , or you can forget about our partnership .
just relax , pascal .
we &apos;ll both get what we deserve .
anything else for you , monsieur lemarchal ?
another montecristo .
my apologies , sir , but we just sold our last two .
je serais heureux de partager .
mrs. grayson .
or should i say miss thorne
after last week &apos;s excitement at the opera ?
emily is fine , if i may call you pascal .
i &apos;m aware that many of my news outlets thrive on scandal ,
but i have no interest in becoming one .
well , then at least , may i ?
merci .
you after a discharge , solider ?
because it looks like
you just shot yourself in the foot .
not at all .
just changed tactics .
to victoria .
back in our midst and back on the market .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that .
pascal lemarchal ?
he was rather dashing at the opera .
didn &apos;t you two date before conrad ?
it &apos;s a regrettable mistake of my youth ,
one that i &apos;m loathe to repeat or discuss .
well , i was just happy to hear that daniel
has finally broken his pattern with emily .
i still cannot believe
that that girl faked her pregnancy .
and everyone believed her !
except you , victoria .
you were suspicious from the onset .
oh , i still am .
emily thorne is a plague on our homes .
and since she seems determined to stay ,
i would appreciate if you would all keep an eye on her for me .
you can count on us .
anyone who is an enemy of yours
is not long for this world .
oh , there &apos;s another one .
excuse me .
get out of my house .
oh , your house ?
well , this placard i intercepted at the front door
augurs otherwise .
stevie &apos;s not gonna let up .
neither will i.
why are you here , conrad ?
you know , i @-@ i &apos;d heard rumors that there was a certain
de la tour original gracing the foyer .
it &apos;s a shameless volley from pascal that i returned .
oh , good .
because the idea of you with that man
makes my blood boil .
well , that almost makes him appealing .
however , your opinion
is as inappropriate as this intrusion .
i would think you would be bothering your first ex @-@ wife
over her recent public revelation .
revelation ?
oh , conrad .
all the morning newspapers you flip through ,
and you always skip page 6 .
you sizing up the competition ?
not exactly .
they want me to be their new editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
in rome .
i didn &apos;t , uh -- didn &apos;t know
that was something you wanted .
oh , no , it &apos;s not .
no , i mean , this is an amazing opportunity .
but all i really want is &quot; voulez . &quot;
and you .
then you &apos;re a lucky girl , &apos; cause you &apos;ve already got both .
well , this magazine will never be mine
as long as my father is in the picture .
i get it , margaux . i do .
but rome ?
no , i know . i know .
that &apos;s why i won &apos;t take it .
i love you too much .
and i can &apos;t wait to start the next step of our lives together .
no , i ...
i can &apos;t let you just throw this chance away .
you need to seriously consider it .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s so much to think about .
being away from you . leaving all this .
passing on the opportunity
to finally cut ties with your father .
are you sure we could handle this ?
no .
but ... i know that i couldn &apos;t handle
keeping you from something that might make you truly happy .
those sticky fingers of yours certainly paid off .
pascal &apos;s coin ?
it &apos;s a poker chip from an ultra @-@ exclusive table in macau .
the buy @-@ in is $ 1 million .
so pascal &apos;s a gambling man .
i guess i &apos;ll have to earn his respect
by beating him at his own game .
so , what &apos;s next ?
&quot; adventures in babysitting &quot; ? really ?
all right , well , what about your -- oh .
most embarrassing moment ever ?
i just got a contender .
javier , my wannabe bestie ,
this is emily , my actual bestie .
are you two gonna hit up atlantic city ?
i have a new method to beat roulette
i am dying to try right now .
it was nice to meet you , javier .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , nolan .
what is this ?
a program to hit on girls while you &apos;re under house arrest ?
no . it &apos;s actually a prototype of what i &apos;m working on .
see , it built an interactive avatar
based on someone &apos;s social @-@ media profile
and my predictive logarithms .
and since charlotte grayson
is famous , scandalous , and pretty ,
she has quite the size @-@ 6 footprint to work from .
hmm . watch .
charvatar , honey , um ...
which neighbor do you have the most in common with ?
it was emily . now it &apos;s you .
oh . well , i see .
it &apos;s a program designed to inflate your ego .
mm . it only speaks truth .
a harvard buddy of mine is the perfect guy
to help us deal with your father .
it &apos;s a bit of a risky move , but ...
yeah , actually , daniel ...
i &apos;ve changed my mind .
&quot; vito splendido &quot; made me an offer ,
and i &apos;m thinking about taking it .
well , i expected other magazines to try and poach you .
i just didn &apos;t expect you to give up so quickly .
i &apos;m not .
i started &quot; voulez &quot; to break free from my father ,
but he won &apos;t even let me have that .
margaux , come on . we can push him out .
i &apos;m sorry , daniel .
my only hesitation was leaving jack ,
and he encouraged me to go .
char . could -- could you come here a sec ?
i was just trying to remember .
when you managed to help emily get all her memory back ,
how did you do that ?
i didn &apos;t . that was jack , remember ?
of course .
my bad .
and h @-@ he asked you to sneak him in here , too , right ?
what are you getting at ?
just that jack seemed to put a lot of
behind @-@ the @-@ scenes effort into emily after the shooting .
yeah . he &apos;s her friend , daniel .
is that all ?
because i just think it &apos;s odd
that he &apos;s trying to push you to leave
now that emily &apos;s single .
daniel , stop . don &apos;t listen to him .
you &apos;re trying to manipulate me .
no , i &apos;m just trying to get you to open your eyes .
jack is doing exactly what your father always has --
what &apos;s best for him .
it &apos;s time to do what &apos;s best for you .
miss thorne ?
pardon the late intrusion ,
but i prefer the intimacy of hand @-@ delivery .
i wanted to invite you to an event that i &apos;m throwing tomorrow --
a monte carlo night for charity .
i doubt you &apos;ll be able to resist
considering it allows you to indulge
in both your favorite virtue and vice .
let &apos;s see .
all of the proceeds go to recherche d &apos;un remède
of which you are a founding member , no ?
and it happens to be a cause that &apos;s dear to my heart .
because of your image issues ,
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re not the best person to help me fight childhood leukemia .
well , there are two sides to every story , pascal .
as there are two sides to every coin .
so you are a liar and a thief ?
there &apos;s so much about me you don &apos;t know .
come to the party , and you &apos;ll find out .
another ex @-@ mrs. grayson .
i &apos;d say &quot; welcome to the club , &quot;
but i don &apos;t care much for the other member .
so , how does it feel ?
liberating .
and , uh , thank you for your old files .
i hope it spurs something new to help clear david &apos;s name .
you let me know if you need anything else .
well , actually , i was wondering
what you could tell me about pascal lemarchal ?
conrad and him seem to have quite a past .
and not just in business .
pascal actually dated victoria first .
i don &apos;t know what happened , but when i got out of rehab ,
she was with conrad , and pascal was history .
so was i.
look who &apos;s here .
there &apos;s my big boy .
you want to go look at the boats ?
let &apos;s go look at the boats .
that sounds fun .
emily , excuse us .
yeah , of course .
are you okay ?
yeah .
except margaux was offered a job in italy .
it killed me , but i encouraged her to take it .
it &apos;s what &apos;s best for her right now .
does that mean that you &apos;re leaving , too ?
we haven &apos;t discussed it yet . maybe .
i -- though i am buying this house ,
so it &apos;ll be long distance for awhile .
guess i &apos;m joining the club , huh ?
actually , i ended things with aiden .
you were ready to spend the rest of your life with him .
what -- what changed ?
i did .
i guess .
i was going through a lot . too much .
and , of course , i pushed him away .
even though you still love him ?
if you want to be happy when this is all over ,
you need to tell him .
i can &apos;t .
the emily thorne that i know can do anything .
thanks .
daniel , please ! charles hayworth ?
that would be like dating your father all over again .
you &apos;re the one who stayed married to the guy for 25 years .
and look how well that turned out .
you have to admit , you did build an empire together .
well , which seemed important when i was your age ,
but it &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m looking for in a man now .
yeah ? what are you looking for , then ?
someone who would take the time to understand me .
well , that &apos;s no easy feat .
and it shouldn &apos;t be . come on .
i heard pascal made a little play for you earlier .
well , he has much to learn if he ever hopes to win me back .
i &apos;m sorry . &quot; back &quot; ?
you two dated ? how did i never hear about this ?
did you ever really want to know about your mother &apos;s dating history ?
god , no , but pascal ?
oh , well , by the time i went to paris on scholarship ,
i was 16 , and i had no one then .
we met at the flea market , believe it not .
he was working a booth there .
and , um ...
there was just something about him .
we were crazy about each other .
pascal taught me how to trust .
and ? what happened ?
well , my visa was only temporary ,
and i had to return to new york .
it seemed like the end of the world to both of us at the time .
he sent me an orchid for every day we were apart .
well , he must have been smitten .
hmm , or he was assuaging his guilt .
i flew to paris to surprise him ,
and i caught him with another woman .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to deal with him now .
well , we all make mistakes in our youth .
don &apos;t i know it .
looks like emily &apos;s making her next move .
she &apos;s hosting an event tomorrow night .
this is for pascal &apos;s charity .
now , what do you suppose she wants with him ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
what are you doing here ?
thanks , buddy .
i , uh -- i waited at your place for a little while .
your neighbor said that i could probably find you here .
he was nice .
yeah , well , people are happy here , emily .
what do you want ?
well , i thought that maybe you &apos;d have some insight .
insight ?
okay .
so you -- you broke our agreement ,
you tracked me down ,
you flew all the way out here to bermuda for insight ?
can &apos;t you just admit that you came to see me ?
so , i wanted to see you . i &apos;m sorry .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t have come .
i miss you .
well , that &apos;s what happens when people part .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s called moving on .
aiden , can &apos;t you just hear me out ?
i wasn &apos;t myself . you know that .
and i &apos;m not nolan .
you can &apos;t just give me the cold shoulder
and expect me to come running to save you the next day .
all right ? i &apos;ve done all i can for you .
we &apos;re on our own from now on .
margaux !
i just spent two hours with an interpol agent .
he received an anonymous tip
that i was using &quot; voulez &quot; as a tax shelter !
i can see how that might be a problem ,
since it &apos;s illegal .
do you realize the damage an investigation like that will do ? huh ?
not only to me , but also to you !
me ?
i am just the silly daughter of the great pascal lemarchal .
who could believe i was involved in such devious plans ?
now , as it turns out ,
daniel grayson is a friend of the interpol agent .
and we would be quite happy to make your problem go away ...
if you give me what i want .
when i arrived here , i was worried
for my little girl swimming with the sharks .
now ...
i &apos;m more worried for the sharks .
&quot; voulez &quot; is yours . i &apos;m out .
and conrad , too .
he was the only reason for your visit , after all .
not the only reason .
well , i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
just filling out the final paperwork
to make your old house my new one .
are you drunk ?
i &apos;m fine .
i heard your other news . about jack .
is it true ?
it is .
it hits harder than i expected .
you know , at first , i thought ...
&quot; is he mine ? &quot;
but then i remembered that by the time you got to rehab ,
we were already sleeping in separate places .
me in our bedroom , and you
wherever you happened to pass out that night .
the pain that i felt ...
leave it to conrad grayson to make my addiction
and unplanned pregnancy about him .
it happened while we were married .
to think that i &apos;d be unaffected is naive .
just as naive as blaming me solely for our divorce .
i have never done that .
no , we share the blame for what we became .
but i never suspected
the stowaway was anything but a refuge ,
but to hear that you ... had a child ...
... with another while we were married ?
conrad ...
come on . we planned on having children of our own , and you ...
well , it &apos;s abundantly clear why you didn &apos;t come to me
to make amends during your 12 steps ,
but that doesn &apos;t excuse the lie .
i was your husband .
i deserved to know .
you &apos;re right .
has mr. lemarchal arrived yet ?
you just had to wear red .
i guess i &apos;ll be betting on black for the night .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;ll be betting on anything ,
seeing as i left the name &quot; grayson &quot; off the guest list .
oh , honey , i don &apos;t need guest lists .
or have you already forgotten the doors i opened for you ?
you were a nobody before me .
quite the turnout for an event hosted by a nobody .
trust me -- people are only here
to see the car wreck that you &apos;ve become .
once the blood is hosed off the pavement ,
they &apos;ll be on their way .
how did you afford all of this , anyway ?
thank you for reminding me .
in all the drama of the divorce ,
i forgot to return this .
margaux , hi .
emily .
daniel , come . we should be celebrating .
you invited your ex ? awkward .
of course i didn &apos;t . his arrogance is unmatched .
well , except , of course , by the french .
speak of le diable ...
you &apos;ve clearly caught his eye .
prove you can play at his level , and you &apos;ll have his ear .
time to ante up .
what is going on between you and emily thorne ?
i had no idea
it would take jealousy to get your attention .
i am trying to help you , as i know your proclivity
is to chase the first skirt that flares at you .
can &apos;t we move on ?
yes , let &apos;s stay in the present .
emily is playing you like she played my son .
but i &apos;m not your son .
pascal , there you are .
victoria .
emily .
i &apos;ve reserved a high @-@ stakes table for the two of us .
care to join me ?
very tempting .
but i had a different opponent in mind tonight .
try your hand at poker ?
i would love to .
great .
emily ...
i &apos;ve found you someone you can compete with .
shall we ?
yeah , let me get , uh ...
... some on 8 ...
22 , 19 , 9 , and 4 .
you just bet my birthday .
no kidding . you &apos;re a leo ?
next you &apos;re gonna tell me
that you love &apos; 80s teen movies and sashimi .
i &apos;m charlotte .
javier .
why haven &apos;t i seen you around before , javier ?
i just moved here . spent the last couple years upstate .
college ?
prison .
should i not have said that ?
no , i &apos;m glad you did .
your honesty is refreshing .
as is your attitude towards ex @-@ cons .
how about you let one buy you a drink ?
i would , but the powers that be won &apos;t let me have one .
javier ? a word ?
so ...
... you tweaked the transmitter .
you did say i was genius .
no , no .
correction . i said your program was genius .
you , on the other hand , are proving exceedingly stupid .
my god , to think i was actually considering a partnership .
hold up . are you serious ?
i was .
but , i mean , this little stunt
is making it very hard to trust you .
i will stay put from now on . promise .
just give me one -- one second . one .
so , uh , i got to run .
but instead of that drink ,
how about i just do you one better .
see you around , neighbor .
winner -- 22 !
wait . you won .
don &apos;t i know it .
yes ! pay me .
all right !
good job . good job .
jack !
i forced my father out of &quot; voulez . &quot;
it &apos;s all mine .
that &apos;s great !
that &apos;s exactly what you wanted . h @-@ how did you do that ?
well , daniel and i came up with a plan .
my father didn &apos;t know what hit him .
daniel ?
are you sure he has your best interests at heart ?
i couldn &apos;t have gotten my magazine back without him .
he &apos;s not the bad person you think he is .
you don &apos;t know him .
yes , i do , jack .
we &apos;ve been friends since we were 10,
which is longer than i can say for you and emily ,
who it seems has quite the reputation herself .
trust me . emily &apos;s nothing like what the papers are saying .
maybe you &apos;re just blinded by your feelings for her .
what are you talking about ?
is she why you &apos;re so eager for me to take a job in italy ?
of course not ! why -- why would you think something like that ?
okay . forget it .
forget i said anything . come .
come celebrate with me .
are you sure ?
yes .
all right , well , carl could use a new pair of shoes .
and a college fund .
there she is . just in time .
i could use some good luck .
oh , come on , man .
jack , it &apos;s fine .
come on !
once ...
i gave jack up ,
i wanted to make it work with you .
but i &apos;d been away for a year ,
and victoria had stolen you .
so i @-@ i didn &apos;t have my husband
or my son ,
and i just -- i fell apart again .
i hated you for leaving me .
but now i realize that i drove you away .
i loved you , steph .
we had our demons -- maybe i still have mine --
but we had some ...
very good years before they took over .
i know .
i regret having involved you in my affairs yet again .
if there was any way i could extricate you
from this new battle with victoria , i would .
no good can come of it .
two good things did --
jack and carl .
which only highlights our separate paths .
i hope we can move on .
leave this mess behind us .
i agree .
when all is said and done ,
i am truly happy for you , steph .
conrad , wait .
it &apos;s time i put something to bed .
pascal , you can get the paperwork started , mon ami .
i &apos;ve got victoria &apos;s trump card .
the last card .
and the winner tonight is ...
my charity , of course .
and the river .
queen of spades .
the bet is to my left .
$ 120,000 to you .
oh , emily , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to fold .
you don &apos;t have enough to match the bet .
i think daniel &apos;s engagement ring should be enough to cover it .
i call .
you &apos;ve been bluffing since you set foot in the hamptons .
why stop now ?
well , maybe i like to try to throw you off your game .
cards , please .
three queens .
for once , she wins legitimately .
shall we settle up ?
yes .
you have quite an impressive poker face , miss thorne .
you &apos;ve been playing me from the start .
why would you say that ?
i think you &apos;re far smarter than the public knows .
and i brought you here &apos; cause i believe
your interest in me is only professional .
if i &apos;m wrong , i &apos;ll wish you good night .
well , you caught me .
so ...
... let &apos;s get down to business .
my short @-@ lived marriage to daniel
provided me access to the graysons &apos; deepest and darkest secrets .
and you &apos;re looking to cash in ?
something like that . provided i can be sure you &apos;re an ally .
an intriguing offer .
i like that .
but why come to a friend of conrad &apos;s ?
because you &apos;re friends second , competitors first .
and i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i make it a point to collect dirt on my rivals .
we have more in common than i expected .
you &apos;ve got a deal .
should we discuss details ?
pascal ...
i feel that i &apos;ve put a considerable amount of energy
into getting your attention .
and now that i have it , i think it &apos;s your turn to get mine .
thank you for the drink .
i sent the sitter home . i hope it &apos;s okay .
of course .
actually , i &apos;d rather see you after the night i &apos;ve had .
what are you doing here ?
i had a bit of a tough one , too .
conrad came by my suite .
what did he do ?
believe it or not ...
he just wanted to talk .
it took me back to a time that i left behind long ago .
not an easy thing to relive .
i thought you said your marriage wasn &apos;t all bad .
when it was bad , it was horrendous .
especially when my drinking got out of control .
the fights we used to get into ...
and when that would happen ,
the only thing that would get me through it
was a couple dozen drinks .
so ... a @-@ are you okay ?
i will be .
i just need to get a good night &apos;s rest .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
okay .
good night .
i received your gift .
and this one i haven &apos;t come to return .
dare i ask how you did it ?
and show my hand ? never .
just as you didn &apos;t show yours earlier .
you let emily win .
i wanted to see how committed she was to her next move .
you &apos;re tracking her .
i &apos;m hunting her .
then you &apos;ll be interested to know
the only thing emily wanted to discuss
was your family &apos;s secrets .
and for you , i will find out why .
i &apos;m grateful to you , pascal .
despite my marriages , my dalliances ,
i still remember the night i lost you .
it &apos;s the blond dragon . my favorite .
it &apos;s thought to be extinct .
almost .
i &apos;m sorry .
i will never betray you again .
i know the sting of betrayal all too well .
and i &apos;m not one to forgive and forget .
but i &apos;m willing to try .
so ... pascal was nixon &apos;ing you ?
i knew there was a camera in the room
when my phone picked up interference .
a cheap , french imitation whalecam .
while i was trying to get him to talk ,
he was doing the same to me -- on tape .
hmm . guy &apos;s good .
and he &apos;s not working alone .
look , i don &apos;t have proof ,
but i &apos;ve been studying victoria &apos;s face for years .
she folded the winning hand . i &apos;m sure of it .
what , so you &apos;re saying the queen lost on purpose ?
i think she wanted me to get close to pascal .
that means frenchy &apos;s a dead end .
along with his mainframe .
i completed my &quot; twm &quot; search
and came up with ... nada .
i &apos;m kind of sort of out of ideas .
i &apos;ve got one .
aiden .
this isn &apos;t about you , emily .
it &apos;s about this .
&quot; twm &quot; is trevor warren mathis .
pascal was talking about my father .
