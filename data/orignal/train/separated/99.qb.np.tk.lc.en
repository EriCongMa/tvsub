第五季 第五集
you &apos;re stable .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ll sell as your publicist .
stability .
you don &apos;t know how many firms i work with
where it &apos;s just constant screaming and backbiting .
i mean , here , you &apos;re all just one big happy family .
joely , could you give me a minute ?
oh , certainly , certainly . i &apos;ll be right out here .
stability .
what ?
alicia is leaving the firm with cary ,
and she &apos;s taking our top clients .
she ...
what ?
i sat down with one of my clients , sonya rucker ,
and asked if she was leaving the firm .
she is .
with cary and alicia , to their new firm .
she ...
with just cary , right ?
no . alicia as well .
i ...
when ?
she &apos;s a partner .
yes , and she had a $ 10,000 stipend
to decorate her office ,
but she stopped three weeks ago , spending only half .
she &apos;s been planning this for three weeks .
will , i know this is hard .
document everything .
you &apos;re leaving ?
no . i just got here .
what ?
you and cary ...
are leaving ?
will ...
no .
it &apos;s an easy answer .
it falls into the &quot; yes or no &quot; category .
you and cary are leaving
and you &apos;re taking some clients with you ?
yes .
and you decided this three weeks ago ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry .
of course . that helps .
it &apos;s time i try something ...
new .
i took you in .
no one wanted you .
i hired you .
i pushed for you .
will ...
this is a business decision .
you were poison !
this firm got you back on your feet .
and i will always be thankful .
and this is how you show it ?
by stealing our clients ?
we didn &apos;t steal anything . these were clients that ...
you have a fiduciary responsibility to this firm ,
and you were going behind our backs .
i didn &apos;t go behind any backs . i ...
you negotiated diane &apos;s exit package .
you asked me to !
and the whole time , you knew you were leaving .
nothing i was doing impacted that negotiation .
oh , god .
god , you &apos;re awful ,
and you don &apos;t even know how awful you are .
this is how you and diane started this firm .
don &apos;t you dare compare ...
okay .
okay .
first of all , you &apos;re fired .
second ...
i &apos;m taking this company cell phone
until such time as ...
excuse me . that &apos;s my personal ...
and i &apos;m taking it into possession
until i can determine which clients you &apos;ve attempted to steal .
you can &apos;t do that .
get out of here , alicia .
right now .
you &apos;re fired .
no .
you don &apos;t want to push this .
i &apos;m a partner .
you want to remove me ,
you need the majority vote of the executive board ,
and then you need a vote of the full board .
i need you to stand right here .
if she tries to contact anyone ,
document it and contact me immediately . do you understand ?
i do .
this is will gardner on the 28th floor .
i need four security guards up here right now .
what should i do ?
give me your phone .
do we tell cary or somebody ?
i can &apos;t tell you what to do .
at some point , you and i are going to be deposed
about what we did just now .
you have to do things on your own .
i &apos;ll talk to cary .
just so you know ,
will is gathering up the excutive commitee and full board
to releave me of my duties , and that will take an hour .
so hurry .
this is alicia florrick . yes .
we need to know if we can move into the office space a week earlier ?
they found out and alicia &apos;s been fired .
and we have half hour .
damn it . we don &apos;t have all the files .
ok . you download and i &apos;ll get the contacts .
we need a quorum howard . let &apos;s go .
what ?
yeah . what do you need ? i &apos;m still working on ...
i need you to shut down all client files to associates computor now .
why ?
cause i need it .
no , i mean , what about the associates
already with files in use ?
shut them down now .
no one accesses files until i say so .
tell me the name of anyone who tries to access files .
okay . anything else ?
no . yes .
one of the partners , alicia florrick ,
don &apos;t let her into the files , either .
i &apos;ll be with you in a moment .
told you they were up to something .
i told you they were screwing us .
yes , and we &apos;ll congratulate you later .
we need to act now . where &apos;s howard ?
present .
we need one more for a quorum .
how about alicia ? she just needs to be here .
we can still vote her out .
what &apos;d she do ?
diane , we need you .
no , she doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
we haven &apos;t signed her exit package .
we need a quorum on the executive committee .
you &apos;re in . i move that the executive committee
immediately take to the full partnership
a proposal to relieve alicia florrick of her duties .
wow , really ?
diane discovered alicia was planning to leave
with cary agos and several of our top clients .
which clients ?
we &apos;re trying to find out now .
all those in favor of relieving alicia florrick of her duties ?
you &apos;re the one who found it out .
are you really going to vote against it ?
give me a second , please .
there &apos;s someone trying to download a file right now .
who ?
carey .
yeah , i know . cary agos .
no , no , the other carey-- zepps .
this way . come with me .
would you like me to come back ?
no . stay !
carey zepps , you &apos;re fired .
we need you to get out of the offices right now .
no , that stays . you take nothing .
my car keys are in my office .
your things will be collected and sent to your home .
if you need your car keys , wait in the lobby .
they &apos;ll be delivered to you .
now , get the hell out of here .
zach , what are you doing ?
heading to school . uh , hey , have you seen
my lincoln essay ? i can &apos;t find it .
i need your help .
you were talking about the cloud at my work ,
files being saved up to the cloud .
mom , did you maybe put it in your room or something ?
do me a favor .
i need all my company contacts and files
saved from the company cloud to my cloud ,
my personal cloud . can you do that ?
you have no idea what any of those words mean , do you ?
no , but can you ...
can you transfer my files so i can use them at home ?
uh , i mean , i don &apos;t know . maybe .
mom , i have chemistry , all right ?
can &apos;t this wait ?
no , unfortunately not . someone is trying to block me ,
and i need to do it now . do you need my password ?
okay . okay , okay , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine here .
this is as far as you can take ... no .
no . look ,
i know you started firing people before i could download
all the files , but i &apos;m staying here .
let &apos;s go .
you want a lawsuit ?
go for it .
lockhart / gardner doesn &apos;t control the lobby of this building .
so let me go .
go down all those corridors
down to that west main door ,
and i want you to look in every single door ...
they don &apos;t know i &apos;m with you .
you know what offends me most ?
the fact that i stood up for you .
i got you hired .
that offends you the most ? really ?
not the fact that every fourth @-@ year was promised a partnership ?
so that &apos;s who you &apos;re in league with ?
all the fourth @-@ years ?
no , i &apos;m making a point .
you brought this on yourself .
the sad thing is , cary ,
i was your mentor .
if you had a disagreement , you could &apos;ve come to me .
every step of the way , i was here to help you ...
oh , come on , diane , this is not a camp .
when i came to your door , you didn &apos;t want to teach .
you wanted to know ...
it &apos;s amazing
how you &apos;ve misinterpreted every single thing .
how did i misinterpret ? you fired me .
the first time .
i put more hours into this place than anything .
i did my best work for you , and you fired me .
we fired you because of alicia ,
and you sure got over that quick .
i need to start something on my own ,
the same way that you and will needed to start .
then do it without our clients .
they &apos;re not your clients !
when was the last time you looked at chumhum ?
when was the last time ?
you &apos;re taking chumhum ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m using that as an example .
we &apos;re ready .
i &apos;ll be right there .
list all of the associates leaving with you .
you can guess .
if you don &apos;t want all of the fourth @-@ years fired ,
you list all of the associates leaving with you .
i am deathly serious .
why do you care ?
you &apos;re gonna be a supreme court justice .
why does this even matter to you ?
i don &apos;t like betrayal .
and i like this firm .
now , you write down the names .
and , cary , you &apos;re fired .
for a second time .
yes , a second time . get the hell out .
the executive committee called this emergency ...
hold on ! quiet down , please !
this is an emergency meeting of the full partnership
with one cause of action .
we have a partner who is actively trying
to steal our top clients .
chumhum .
who said that ?
cary . agos , cary .
now , as you all know , a partner can &apos;t be removed
without the majority vote of the full partnership .
we &apos;ve just been told this new firm is making a play for chumhum .
we will now entertain a motion
to remove alicia florrick of her duties .
they don &apos;t know that i &apos;m with you .
should i stay here after you go ?
i can &apos;t say anything .
i think i can feed you stuff from the inside .
alicia ? what &apos;s going on ?
candace , hi .
i forgot , we have a depo today , don &apos;t we ?
we do . can i come in ?
yes , of course . please .
what &apos;s going on ? are you under arrest ?
i &apos;m in the process ...
i &apos;m forming my own firm ,
and i think i &apos;m being pushed out today .
uh , okay , but i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re my lawyer .
will gardner &apos;s your lawyer , too .
yeah , but you &apos;re the one i &apos;ve mostly dealt with .
where is this new firm ?
can my case go with you ?
actually , i ... i can &apos;t answer that right now .
excuse me , alicia .
could you step out here a second ?
after a vote by the full partnership ,
you &apos;ve been officially removed from your position .
gentlemen , will you escort her out , please ?
i want my phone back .
after we ascertain whether
there are lockhart / gardner materials on it ,
we will messenger it to you .
this was never meant personally .
i don &apos;t give a damn .
she didn &apos;t do anything ?
no , she just waited for you to return .
she didn &apos;t try to contact any of the associates ?
no .
good . hang around here today .
okay .
kalinda , you got a second ?
yeah , sure .
where were you ?
at home .
what &apos;s up ?
we fired alicia and cary .
and the other carey .
they were intending to steal our top clients .
wow .
yeah .
now , here &apos;s what i need to know .
are you leaving with her ?
with alicia ?
uh , no .
because if you are , you need to leave right now .
i &apos;m not .
david lee says you are .
well , david lee says a lot of things .
you &apos;re friends with alicia ,
and she didn &apos;t tell you about leaving ?
no .
clearly , i @-@ i wasn &apos;t friend enough .
okay . i need to know which associates are leaving with them
and which clients , and i need to know fast .
okay .
you don &apos;t know now ?
no , but i can find out .
things are crumbling around here , kalinda ,
and i need to know who i can trust .
can i trust you ?
you can .
good . find out what &apos;s going on .
okay . come on . move it along .
stand over there . right over there .
what &apos;s going on ?
who are they ?
the associates cary says he &apos;s leaving with .
we &apos;re lining them up to fire their asses .
cary &apos;s screwing with you .
they &apos;re all protected classes .
he named them because he knows you can &apos;t fire them .
damn it .
get to the fourth @-@ year associates .
fire them .
get them out of the building now .
i &apos;ll go .
so , about stability ...
you &apos;re hired . you &apos;re our new publicist ,
and i need you to start right away .
yeah , certainly .
we had to fire a partner .
and she &apos;s the wife of the next governor .
okay , get up ! you &apos;re fired .
let &apos;s go .
hands up from the keyboard . you &apos;re both fired .
okay , the first step is we call all the clients .
everybody , get on a cell phone .
all the partners . we split up the list across the hall ...
who &apos;s that ? the nurse &apos;s deposition .
that &apos;s now ?
and what are we telling the clients ?
we give the reasons for firing alicia florrick .
and don &apos;t just make it about the new firm .
the reason has to do with performance .
she was stealing money .
no , we can &apos;t say that .
next we go to court .
we get a restraining order
against further pursuit of our clients .
we can &apos;t win that .
it &apos;s not about winning .
it &apos;s about slowing them down .
it &apos;s about an off @-@ speed pitch .
they &apos;ve had one month to pursue our clients .
now we have the advantage .
okay , i get it .
i can find my own way home .
who else did they get ? are you the last ?
beth was still there .
they still haven &apos;t found her and robyn .
they can get us downloads .
will blocked files to everyone but partners .
how are people working ?
they aren &apos;t . they &apos;re too busy battling us .
okay , we have to get on with all our clients ,
let them know we &apos;re leaving a week early .
who had the cappuccino ? the tea ?
guys , we need to move fast .
we need to split up our list .
will will be on with everybody .
we need to move up our press release .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
i already called the new offices .
we can pick up the keys tomorrow .
one thing you all lost is bonuses .
hey . hey , guys .
if we don &apos;t get our clients in line ,
we don &apos;t have a firm to open .
cary , are you on chumhum ?
yeah , i &apos;ll call neil gross .
who &apos;s our second @-@ best client ?
von erich at svi holdings . i &apos;ll call .
steve von erich .
oh , hello .
yes .
no , i hadn &apos;t heard .
yes , we fired mrs. florrick , unfortunately .
we discovered some issues in her performance .
what issues ?
well , we &apos;d rather not say , at least
not until the authorities look into it ,
but i want to assure you , we looked into her work
on your account and found no money missing .
mr. vonerich , it &apos;s alicia . hi .
yes , i wanted to get back to you about the firm .
i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the best time
for me to move right now .
they got to him .
were there some financial irregularities ?
they said there may be some worries
about money being taken from accounts you serviced .
do you still want another investigator ?
do i st ... ?
look , lockhart / gardner is starting to crumble ,
and will is going crazy .
he &apos;s lashing out at you with everything he &apos;s got .
so , do you still want another investigator ?
we have one .
robyn doesn &apos;t win cases .
robyn &apos;s within our budget .
that last deal that you offered me-- i &apos;ll take it .
kalinda , what &apos;s going on ?
look , lockhart / gardner can survive without you ,
alicia and half a dozen others ,
but ... it can &apos;t survive without diane .
i can read the writing on the wall .
okay . you really want to join us , get us something .
get us the chumhum files .
they &apos;ve thrown up a firewall .
where do you want me to bring them ? here ?
155 emerson .
okay .
we lost von erich &apos;s hedge fund .
and the paisley group .
we &apos;re being badmouthed to the clients .
it &apos;s will . he &apos;s in commando mode .
so what do we do ?
what are you doing ?
distracting him .
hello .
candace .
hi . it &apos;s alicia .
i just wanted to check and see how the deposition was going .
it &apos;s not going anywhere at the moment . where are you ?
downstairs . is will not with you ?
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s just ...
he &apos;s on his phone .
the concern here , candace ,
is that it took us six months to set this deposition up .
and if it doesn &apos;t happen now ,
they could delay another six months .
no , no , no ... yes , she &apos;s the governor &apos;s wife ,
but that isn &apos;t always a good thing .
mr. gardner ?
we need to start the deposition now .
okay , good . i &apos;ll call you back .
candace , yes .
i just need a few more minutes .
no . i &apos;m sorry .
we need to do this now , or they &apos;ll leave .
okay . let me get my files .
mom , pick up the phone .
hey , mom , pick up the phone .
hey , mom , pick up the phone .
hey , mom , pick up the phone .
hey , mom , pick up ...
hello ?
who is this ?
will gardner .
hi . um , this is grace .
is my mom there ?
she &apos;s um ...
left her cellphone .
um ... can you give her message from me ?
i ... i can &apos;t find my permission for
my chemistry field trip ,
um ... i need her to call them .
i don &apos;t ... know if i &apos;m gonna see her ,
maybe , try at home ?
i &apos;m at home ,
and she &apos;s not here .
look , if you see her ,
can you have her call me please ?
ok .
thanks .
hello , cary agos
hello , mr. agos ,
what can i do for you today ?
hello , mr. gross ,
i &apos;m thrilled , i haven &apos;t got you on your cell .
yeah , i was up in the air .
now i &apos;m on the ground , heading to your offices
to discuss the suit , so can it wait ?
actually , it can &apos;t , sir .
uh , can we ...
can we meet you at your chumhum offices ?
uh , my offices ? why ?
got a doppio macchiato !
because we &apos;re making the move today .
we &apos;re leaving lockhart / gardner and starting florrick / agos .
you &apos;re starting your own firm today ?
yes , sir . you know time like a present .
well , um , i should warn you , cary .
my peeps on the west coast aren &apos;t too thrilled
with the idea of me leaving lockhart / gardner
for what &apos;s essentially a start @-@ up .
start @-@ up ? with the governor &apos;s wife ?
yeah , well , that &apos;s a two @-@ way street .
um , we &apos;ve been reviewing
the political rules for the governor ,
and , um , kind of a tangle .
five @-@ year plan .
they won &apos;t be a tangle with us , sir .
let us come by , and we &apos;ll lay out our five @-@ year plan for you .
just how i want to spend my afternoon :
listening to my next five years .
hello ?
alicia , it &apos;s candace .
shouldn &apos;t we be going after wrongful termination ,
not sexual harassment ?
candace , is the deposition happening now ?
yes , but all of mr. gardner &apos;s questions are geared
toward sexual harassment .
i thought we &apos;d lose harassment .
but didn &apos;t you fire our client because she was too pretty ?
no , no , it wasn &apos;t that she was too pretty .
there was ...
actually , could you hold on a second ?
hey , wait .
candace .
is that alicia ?
yeah .
she thinks we should be going after wrongful termination .
may i , please ?
alicia , you &apos;ve been removed from your position at this firm .
yes , and she called me . i didn &apos;t call her .
you engage with any of our clients again ,
and we &apos;ll take you to court .
for what ?
for tortious interference .
oh , come on . the only one interfering here is you .
telling our clients that i stole money ?
all we told the clients is you were fired .
and you contact any of them again and i swear , alicia ,
you and cary will not have a penny left in the bank .
oh , go to hell .
no , you go .
oh ... your daughter called .
she needs you to call her school to let her go on a field trip .
oh . when was this ?
about 40 minutes ago .
oh . okay , thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
what did they say ?
they don &apos;t have the chumhum files .
what ? what don &apos;t they have ?
the chumhum files .
cary said that ?
yeah . they &apos;re trying to meet with neil gross .
we need to get court time right now .
was there anything else ?
they have offices at 155 emerson .
oh , i know that building .
i &apos;m on it .
department of health , please .
anyone else here working with them ?
yes .
robyn .
yeah .
i &apos;ll introduce it .
then throw it to me . i &apos;ll handle the lawsuit .
alicia , you &apos;ll handle the ethical rules .
florrick / agos .
there you all are .
welcome to my house .
you remember carey zepps .
yeah , i sure do .
one of you needs to change your name , though .
come on up . oh .
yeah , this guy .
alicia florrick ?
yes .
cary agos ?
this is a restraining order preventing you from meeting
any representative of chumhum . i read it .
it charges tortious ...
tortious interference with trade .
that &apos;s right .
well , this is awkward .
tell me when you guys work this out .
damn it .
yep .
well , because it doesn &apos;t make any sense , doug .
i haven &apos;t made any decisions on pensions , period .
oh , okay , yeah .
let &apos;s go to a more neutral subject .
my wife . go . shoot .
no . what ?
eli .
well , i &apos;m gonna have to check into that .
no , i can &apos;t confirm or deny ,
and i &apos;ll get back to you .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
that was doug fletcher from the tribune .
he says that alicia was fired today .
she ...
what ?
have you heard anything ?
no .
fired from her job ?
that &apos;s what he says .
all we did was block them .
now we got to get a meeting with neil gross .
hello .
hello ?
will ?
yes .
where &apos;s alicia ?
she &apos;s , uh ...
out .
she &apos;s not here anymore .
why ?
she was in the process of stealing clients .
no , she was in the process of trying to form her own firm ,
and they were unhappy clients .
peter , you don &apos;t want to get involved in this .
i &apos;ve always been involved in this , okay ?
you &apos;re the governor @-@ elect .
i &apos;m a private citizen with a practice to run .
you can &apos;t get involved in this
without it blowing back and hurting you .
okay , thanks for the advice , jackass .
listen to me .
i &apos;m not just a governor .
i am a husband .
and i will handle this as a husband .
okay , should i be recording this ?
am i in trouble now ?
am i gonna be audited ?
are you really trying to turn this around ?
you sleep with my wife ,
you fire her and tell me ...
excuse me . nobody was talking about sleeping ...
oh , gosh .
i &apos;m sorry . have i offended you ?
no , i &apos;m just trying to figure out
what i should feel bad about , buddy .
well , try this on for size .
you don &apos;t want to make me your enemy .
and you certainly don &apos;t want alicia and me together .
okay , good to know .
i &apos;m hanging up now .
i have a business to run .
yeah , let &apos;s see how that goes .
we need to get the offices painted .
yeah , but one office at a time
so we can still move in tomorrow .
what about the furniture ?
i &apos;ll get on that .
wait , wait , wait .
we got a problem .
just got back from our offices .
ran five blocks .
the department of health just closed down
the building for fumigation .
what ?
yeah , they got an anonymous tip there was a vermin infestation .
so , when can we move in ?
two months .
oh , god , you &apos;re kidding !
what ?
we need a place right now .
it &apos;s will .
it &apos;s david lee .
his fingerprints are all over it .
wait , how did they even know
where we were going ?
we got to delay our opening .
we wait the two months until they &apos;re done .
no , we go now .
they want us to wait . screw them .
okay , so where do we work ?
thank you , your honor .
that &apos;s all we need .
mom ?
grace , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s my bible study from campus faith .
what &apos;s going on here ?
uh , my firm .
we have to work here a few days .
yes , that &apos;s right , your honor .
governor @-@ elect florrick &apos;s office .
oh , hi , patricia .
i didn &apos;t know we had a meeting .
we don &apos;t .
i just wanted to inform peter
about some events today .
alicia being fired ?
she wasn &apos;t fired .
she was asked to leave early .
she was planning to exit the firm to start her own ...
but it &apos;s my understanding
that you slapped alicia with a restraining order .
i didn &apos;t have anything ...
i &apos;m no longer involved
with strategy at lockhart / gardner .
but you &apos;re in court this afternoon
defending the restraining order .
as a formality .
eli , is this going to impact the judgeship ?
diane , we are not in the business
of letting personal concerns affect
our professional decisions .
you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
we &apos;re fine .
don &apos;t worry .
let &apos;s kill them now and get it over with .
the honorable judge james chase presiding .
this is a matter of a restraining order , is that correct ?
yes , your honor , we have a motion ...
yeah , that instills confidence .
and this is a motion to suppress ?
yes , your honor .
there has been no tortious interference of trade here .
the court is taking sides in a legally proper splitting
of firm assets .
your honor , we wish this were all legally proper ,
but the attorneys who intend to split off
have made improper avowals ...
excuse me . we have not .
in fact , it has been the position of the plaintiff ...
sit down and let him speak !
no , you sit down .
we have just as much right ...
i have laryngitis today .
and i need everyone to quiet down .
your honor , if we could call a witness to the stand
to speak to the defense &apos;s lies ?
no , i won &apos;t .
what ? we discussed this .
and i &apos;ve changed my mind .
yeah . that instills confidence .
let &apos;s go right here , you little piece ...
that &apos;s enough .
now , do you have a witness or not ?
oh , we have a witness .
now , you were intending to leave with the other
lockhart / gardner attorneys , isn &apos;t that right ?
bitch .
yes .
and what made you change your mind ?
i thought that they were lying
to the clients they wanted to take .
wow , an exact imitation of the language you need .
objection !
sustained .
restrain yourself , ma &apos;am .
and how did they lie to clients ?
they said that the partners didn &apos;t have
their best interests at heart .
they pursued the clients for months
before they left , and then they said
only they could offer continuity of service on their cases .
and how do you know this ?
i was with them .
no further questions .
thank you .
beth , what did lockhart / gardner offer you today ?
objection . vague .
thank you . i &apos;ll clarify .
did anyone at lockhart / gardner offer you
a promotion in the last 12 hours ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
seems relevant to me . she &apos;s trying to find out
if you bought her testimony .
did you , beth , get offered
any promotion in the last 12 hours ?
well ... here &apos;s the thing .
i was offered a partnership eight months ago .
and then , now that one of the partners is leaving ,
i have been offered her position .
and who offered you this partnership ?
mr. gardner .
i see .
not exactly 30 pieces of silver .
objection , your honor !
in the absence of testimony to the contrary ,
i &apos;m keeping the restraining order in place .
your honor !
no .
the status quo will hold
until i can get a fuller hearing .
but the status quo means that lockhart / gardner
can lobby chumhum ?
of course , we can . it &apos;s our client .
a client intending to leave , your honor .
yes , and if they intends to leave , they &apos;ll leave .
in the meantime , the status quo holds .
the restraining order stays in place .
we &apos;re going to starve you .
you really can &apos;t handle the competition .
that wasn &apos;t competition . you were going behind our backs .
that &apos;s right .
walk away , judas .
we &apos;re coming after you .
all your clients .
every single one we worked to make happy
while you swept in at the last minute to take credit .
we &apos;re taking them .
and then you know what you &apos;ll have ?
a very nice suite of offices .
wow . that was amazing .
who got burned in will &apos;s bribery scandal ?
which judges ?
parks , dunaway , winter . why ?
winter-- he &apos;s in court now .
what are you doing ?
just talk about the privacy lawsuit .
don &apos;t obviously sell us .
make it seem like it &apos;s a given he &apos;s with us .
i &apos;ll talk about the philosophy of the law .
no , howard , just nod and look like you agree .
lockhart / gardner ! how we doing ?
mr. gross , my brother . how are you , sir ?
good . nice to see you guys .
why don &apos;t you come on up to my office ?
all right .
hello !
sorry to bother you again .
will gardner ? david lee ?
you gotta be kidding me .
here &apos;s a restraining order preventing you
from meeting with any representative of chumhum .
okay , i &apos;m going back to work .
come see me when you &apos;ve worked this out .
it &apos;s her , isn &apos;t it ?
yep . it &apos;s an order from judge winter .
ah , time to play hardball .
all right , thank you very much . the restraining order worked .
they cannot meet with chumhum .
yes !
okay , where are we on clients ?
originally we had 12 .
we &apos;re down to four .
three . we lost paisley .
i think we should talk to bishop .
no , that &apos;s a bad ...
he &apos;s a lockhart / gardner client .
he &apos;s fair game .
what &apos;s wrong with bishop ?
he &apos;s the top drug dealer in town .
so ? it &apos;s a lot of money .
we said we &apos;d never go there .
i agree with you .
hi . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , hey , mom . uh , i was just telling carey
about our study group .
really ?
yes . i should get going back .
it was nice meeting you , grace .
you , too . oh , but try it out .
you &apos;ll like it , the daily app .
i will .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , the daily app ?
just daily scripture readings .
what did i do wrong ?
nothing . why don &apos;t you get back to your homework ?
okay , mom .
one minute .
peter , what are you doing ?
i came over to see how you were doing .
you heard .
yes , i heard .
that &apos;s not the reaction i was expecting .
i thought you &apos;d be out on some ledge somewhere .
oh , no , we &apos;re too busy kicking ass .
look at you . you look like you &apos;re 25 years old .
fresh out of law school .
ready to , um ...
ready to , um , conquer the world .
okay , but we have to be quick .
sorry , there &apos;s no time for that .
we &apos;ve got ten minutes .
otherwise , they &apos;re gonna start
making some bad decisions out there .
oh , okay . we wouldn &apos;t want that .
is this what they mean by &quot; leaning in ? &quot;
you want me to lean in ? ah !
how &apos;s that ?
i so ... deeply respect you ...
as a professional .
hawaii &apos;s gonna have to wait .
well , i thought as much .
once we &apos;re up and running .
there &apos;s nothing fairer .
everybody gets a shot .
we drop our restraining orders ?
we both do .
we get an hour each with neil gross
to pitch our services .
whoever wins , wins .
hi , alicia .
and will and david lee agree to this deal ?
it &apos;s not a deal .
and yes , they do .
we drop our restraining orders ,
and tomorrow morning at 10 : 00 a.m. , you go in .
11 : 00 a.m. , we go in .
no , we go second .
we can work with that .
as long as we compromise .
oh , look , it was really good to see you all .
i should , uh , probably have
an answer for you by this afternoon .
don &apos;t forget-- the law is a bitch of a mistress .
ready for you guys .
lesson for the future : don &apos;t go second .
so , hit me with it .
well , sir , lockhart / gardner &apos;s
a firm without its worker bees .
we should know . we &apos;re the bees .
uh , we ... we looked at the way you started chumhum ,
mr. gross ,
and you rewarded work over show .
that &apos;s exactly what we plan to do : reward work .
billable hours ,
they won &apos;t be applied as partner hours
unless you actually receive partner hours .
you &apos;re not gonna ...
okay , guys , thanks ,
but , um , i &apos;m not going with you .
why not ?
because of you .
the governorship should work for me ,
not against me .
your husband , ma &apos;am ,
has promised the most
ethical administration in illinois history .
i can &apos;t have my law firm jumping at every ethical shadow
that comes down the pike .
we won &apos;t .
yes , you will .
it &apos;s the way the world works .
politics leads .
the law follows .
but , uh , thank you .
and i wish you the best of luck with your new firm .
what just happened ?
our firm just went down the drain .
i offered her managing partner .
i offered her diane &apos;s job .
alicia ?
yes . she could &apos;ve been managing partner
at one of the top firms in the city ,
and she pisses it all away .
i don &apos;t understand that .
she wanted to do something on her own .
with cary ? that &apos;s not on her own .
will , i know you &apos;re hurting ,
but she &apos;s not the enemy here .
when did you really know she was doing this ?
leaving ?
a week ago .
and cary ?
three months ago .
i should &apos;ve told you , will .
kalinda , i &apos;m building this firm
into the biggest in the country , starting today .
and i need to know who i can trust .
you can trust me .
are you sure ?
because i &apos;m going to destroy the competition .
can you do that ?
yeah .
good .
good morning .
the pension problem in illinois is real
and increasingly insurmountable .
after inauguration , this is the first issue
i intend to address , and i &apos;m asking the republicans
and democrats to join me in a bipartisan conversation
to find solutions .
the status quo is not an option .
not anymore .
are you going to negotiate ?
there will be no questions at this time .
uh , just one other matter .
i want to talk about taxation of internet commerce .
internet purveyors have ,
for far too long , in my opinion ,
enjoyed the benefits of no taxation .
i find this to be unfair .
i &apos;m not saying that my opinion won &apos;t change on this matter ,
and , of course , i &apos;m always open to dialogue ,
but i will have to be convinced that there is a reason
for massive social networking companies
not to carry their own weight .
thank you .
did you just do what i think you did ?
i &apos;m simply stating my opinion
about the taxation of web commerce .
peter , you can &apos;t be doing that .
it &apos;ll come back to bite us .
you worry too much , eli .
i want to talk about taxation of internet commerce .
hey . hey , did you see this ?
internet purveyors ...
alicia &apos;s husband just said it . it &apos;s right here .
... have , for far too long , in my opinion ,
enjoyed the benefits of no taxation .
i find this to be unfair .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m not saying that my opinion won &apos;t change on this matter .
damn it .
what ? what is it ?
we just lost chumhum .
what are you talking about ?
the governor @-@ elect just threatened them with a big stick .
he can &apos;t do that .
neil gross , please .
it &apos;s will gardner .
well , when will he be back in ?
i want to thank you guys
for giving me a chance to think it over .
i @-@ i &apos;m thrilled to come with your firm .
we &apos;re thrilled , too , sir .
and maybe i &apos;ll have a chance
to meet your husband at some point ,
mrs. florrick .
i know he has an open mind on our tax burden .
he would love that .
great .
one second ! one second !
congratulations to florrick , agos &amp; associates .
yes !
yes ! we are now a firm .
we &apos;ve got a $ 35 @-@ million @-@ a @-@ year client .
oh , thank you , thank you .
all we need now is office space ,
some more lawyers ...
stationery , assistants .
and computers .
but we got to celebrate the good news when it comes
because there &apos;s gonna be a lot of bad news .
wow , talk about negative .
all right , all right , everybody raise their glasses .
to florrick , agos &amp; associates .
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
eli , come in for a sec , will you ?
yes ?
yeah , would you do me a favor and put together ...
a list of other supreme court justice nominees ?
instead of diane ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
yeah .
