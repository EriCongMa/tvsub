&lt; i &gt; orson &apos;s wife , alma , disappeared . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; gabby found a new calling . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m unbelievable . close your mouths .
&lt; i &gt; someone new moved in . &lt; / i &gt;
he &apos;s a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister .
&lt; i &gt; but lynette found a dark secret . &lt; / i &gt;
our neighbor is a pedophile .
you can &apos;t sit on this , lynette .
&lt; i &gt; orson &apos;s mother revealed his past . &lt; / i &gt;
he cheated on alma . broke her heart ,
for his precious monique .
monique polier ?
&lt; i &gt; the police couldn &apos;t find evidence ... &lt; / i &gt;
we couldn &apos;t find the toolbox .
the man &apos;s a plumber .
&lt; i &gt; ... until mike tried to hide it . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;ll take those .
&lt; i &gt; the annual block party
was a winter tradition on wisteria lane . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it was a way for the residents to spread holiday cheer . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; everyone was invited . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; including art shepard , the newest resident of wisteria lane . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but as the big night drew near , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; more than holiday cheer was being spread around . &lt; / i &gt;
did you hear about the new guy that just moved in ?
well , get a load of this .
apparently , the perv &apos;s got all this weird stuff
in his basement .
no , seriously .
it &apos;s like this big kiddie trap full of toys .
&lt; i &gt; by sunday evening , most of the gossiping had subsided &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and the neighborhood was once again consumed &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; by the spirit of the season . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; friends laughed over eggnog . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; lovers kissed under mistletoe . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and the mood was jolly . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that is , until a certain guest made his appearance . &lt; / i &gt;
look who &apos;s here !
merry christmas , everybody !
merry christmas !
don &apos;t you do that ! don &apos;t you know what he did ?
now , kids , who &apos;s been good this year ?
oh , come on . everybody was naughty ?
what am i gonna do with this fire truck ?
joey , get back here !
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m not sure .
let &apos;s go , girls .
art , maybe we should go .
&lt; i &gt; yes , for the residents of wisteria lane , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it was the most wonderful time of the year . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but for arthur shepard and his sister , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it had turned out to be a very silent night . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; for the residents of wisteria lane , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the holiday season could only begin ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... once the decorations came out . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; for some , that meant pulling out the colored lights . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; for others , it meant locating that holiday wreath . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; then there were those eager to display their nativity scene . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but for a romantic few , it was all about ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... the mistletoe . &lt; / i &gt;
you have to kiss me . it &apos;s the law .
while you &apos;re in a good mood ,
i thought i &apos;d spring something on you .
my parents are coming to town .
your parents ? really ?
and i wondered
if you might be free to join us for dinner saturday .
absolutely !
so i assume this means they know about me ?
but of course.- and they know about me as in ,
&quot; mum , dad , bloody good news !
i &apos;ve got myself a smashing new girlfriend &quot; ?
that &apos;s adorable .
please don &apos;t do it in front of them .
right .
so do you want me to make reservations
at that little french place ?
we could do that .
but it &apos;s a four @-@ hour layover ,
and they &apos;ll be exhausted .
i thought we might have a more enjoyable time
if they came here and you made dinner for them .
ok . i guess it &apos;s time we have the conversation .
ian ...
... haven &apos;t you ever wondered why i &apos;ve never cooked for you ?
i just assumed that you were lazy .
no . i wish .
my cooking is not good .
well , my parents won &apos;t be expecting a gourmet meal .
will they be expecting stomach cramps ?
acid reflux ? night sweats ?
come on . you can &apos;t be that bad .
is it really important that i make them a home @-@ cooked meal ?
it &apos;s just , they &apos;re very old @-@ fashioned , hearth and home types .
and they might wonder
why you didn &apos;t make the effort .
but it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;ll win them over ... eventually .
ok , i &apos;ll give it a shot .
thank you .
now , nothing elaborate .
just a simple roast and something appropriate to go with it .
right . like an ambulance .
no , amy , small steps , small .
little miss snowflake glides ,
she doesn &apos;t stomp .
is that better ? - getting there , sweetie .
if she was a horse , we &apos;d have to shoot her .
poor thing . she tries so hard .
yeah , she &apos;s a trouper .
let &apos;s dump her .
what ? why ?
consultants are judged on the strength of their roster .
we can &apos;t bounce every nose @-@ picking no @-@ talent ,
but we can lose the one who &apos;s dragging us down .
and that &apos;s amy
we can &apos;t do that . her mother died last year .
yes , i know , i know , and it &apos;s tragic .
but we are running a business .
amy is sucking up all our time
and we should be focusing on sherri .
she actually has a shot at winning .
how will i tell her family ?
we &apos;ll do it together .
we &apos;ll be diplomatic.- are you sure about this ?
the poor kid &apos;s been through the wringer .
amy ! for god sakes !
little miss snowflake does not scratch down there !
well , then again , her mother died a year ago .
how long is she gonna milk it ?
mother hodge , i have your breakfast .
just put it over there .
i &apos;ll pick through it later .
what are you watching ?
home movies .
it &apos;s fun looking back at the past , isn &apos;t it ?
well , it &apos;s one way to kill time while you &apos;re waiting for death .
we also have cable .
have you decided what you &apos;re gonna do about orson ?
decided ?
yes . have you called a lawyer yet ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s any of your concern .
i don &apos;t mean to pry .
but i think you &apos;re a good christian woman ,
and you deserve better than my son .
well , i will take that under advisement .
if you give him a chance he &apos;ll draw you back in .
it &apos;s what he does .
just walk away .
it &apos;s not that easy . i love him .
you &apos;ll get over it . i did .
merry christmas !
hello .
merry christmas . oh , wait , wait , wait .
well , believe me , rita , he scares me too .
you know what ? we should have a meeting .
get all the moms together
and figure out what to do about this guy .
saturday . your house sounds good .
hey , rita , i gotta go .
sorry , i can &apos;t talk now . i have somewhere to go .
well , my brother doesn &apos;t .
the youth center just fired him .
are you happy ?
i &apos;m not sad .
he shouldn &apos;t be around kids .
i saw those pictures .
those boys were on his swim team .
he was proud of them .
turning that into something dirty
says more about you than him .
you can defend him all you want .
i know what i know .
did you know my brother got spit on
at the hardware store yesterday ?
that they refused to serve us at the diner ?
that our tire got slashed at the church parking lot ?
i am not a well woman .
i don &apos;t need this stress .
well , i am sorry that happened .
have you considered , even for a moment ,
that you could be wrong ?
that you misinterpreted what you saw ?
that you are ruining my brother &apos;s life
and mine over nothing ?
i have kids , ok ?
better safe than sorry .
as long as you &apos;re safe , what do you care who &apos;s sorry ?
so i &apos;m cooking dinner for ian &apos;s parents tomorrow night ,
and it &apos;s the first time i &apos;m meeting them ,
so i sort of want to impress them .
and yet you &apos;re cooking ?
well , that &apos;s the thing .
so i was hoping , you know , if you &apos;re not too busy ...
oh , no , no . these things practically build themselves .
thank you . you are a lifesaver .
actually , i could probably use the distraction .
i asked orson to move out last night .
come on , why would you bury your toolbox in the woods ?
i knew the cops were looking for it and i panicked .
i was trying to buy myself some time .
you may have bought 20 @-@ to @-@ life .
let the guy enjoy his breakfast .
stay out of this , carlos .
mike , i want you to look at me .
you look me in the eye and
you swear to me that you didn &apos;t kill anybody .
how many times do i have to tell you ? i can &apos;t remember .
you can &apos;t remember , or you don &apos;t want to remember ?
guys ?
you have got to go to the police with all of this .
i can &apos;t . not yet . i need some time to think .
his wife goes missing , then his mistress turns up dead .
what is there to think about ?
i know it sounds suspicious , but in my heart of hearts ,
i just can &apos;t believe that orson could do such a thing .
sweety , we all want to believe
the best of the people we care about .
but you cannot let your
feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts .
what in the world ?
oh , my god !
what &apos;s going on ?
they just arrested mike for murder .
what ?
they &apos;re saying he killed that woman on the news ,
that monique person .
oh , thank god .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re gonna break that little girl &apos;s heart .
do not wimp out on me here .
we gotta do what &apos;s best for the business .
what if her father yells at me ?
then i will jump in and defend you .
ok . but if you do , try and be diplomatic .
i &apos;m always diplomatic .
now just get in there , you spineless &apos; mo .
excuse me , mr. pearce ?
so glad you could come today .
this is my partner , gabrielle .
pleasure to meet you .
shall we ?
so , what did you want to talk to me about ?
is there a problem with amy ?
not a problem , per se .
we &apos;re just a little concerned
that she might not have the temperament
for pageant competitions .
and what does that mean ?
well , when it comes to performing , she &apos;s not exactly ...
well , she tends to be ... feel free to jump in .
i have no idea where you &apos;re going with this .
well , as gaby and i discussed , amy has certain limitations .
her odds of winning are slim .
vern !
he is so competitive .
i constantly have to remind him they &apos;re just kids .
when did you lose the joy ?
oh , i think you know .
wait , i &apos;m confused . are you dumping amy ?
of course not , bill .
can i call you bill ?
it &apos;s just , we feel that
amy would benefit from some private coaching .
maybe i could come to your house ? say , friday , 5 : 00 ?
sure . yeah , i guess .
great . it &apos;s a date .
maybe i should come , too .
after the harsh things you said about amy ,
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m gonna need a good lawyer .
and that may take a little research .
and whoever takes my case will need a retainer .
so if you don &apos;t mind , i promise i &apos;ll pay you back .
oh , ok .
make sure he knows about my wrench .
apparently , they tested it
and found traces of this monique &apos;s blood .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve picked up on this , mike ,
but i haven &apos;t been happy .
no , i didn &apos;t pick up on it .
i wanted to tell you this weeks ago .
i wish that i had . because now , i know you &apos;re gonna think
i &apos;m breaking up with you over the blood on the axe .
wrench .
whatever .
but believe me , that &apos;s not it .
it &apos;s just ...
we are moving too fast .
what are you trying to say ?
well , maybe we should just take a break .
you know , date other people .
you &apos;re telling me this on the day i &apos;m put in a men &apos;s prison ?
well , i said the timing was bad .
i am sorry . i-- i really am .
i just can &apos;t do this .
they told me somebody was coming ,
but i did not expect it to be you .
is edie getting you a good lawyer ?
i doubt it . she dumped me today .
what ? why ?
well , i was arrested for murder .
still ... it &apos;s tacky .
well , ok , then ... i &apos;ll help get you out .
what &apos;s your bail ?
a million dollars .
you don &apos;t have to help me , susan .
i want to .
are you gonna ask ?
what ?
if i killed that woman .
i don &apos;t have to . i know you didn &apos;t .
i wish i was that sure .
i ...
i have these flashes where i see her face ,
so i must have known her .
and if i did , maybe something happened .
maybe i got angry , maybe ...
there &apos;s an explanation for this ,
and we &apos;re gonna figure it out .
don &apos;t worry about a thing .
miss gabrielle !
when are you gonna come outside and watch me ?
oh , the grass , honey and my allergies .
go ahead and practice .
i &apos;ll watch you from here .
are you sure i can &apos;t help with anything ?
no , i &apos;ve been a single dad for a while now .
i got the dinner thing down .
i &apos;ve got the restaurant thing down .
i can &apos;t bring myself to cook for one .
not that i ever cooked for two .
well , no restaurant tonight .
you are having dinner with us .
that &apos;s sweet .
it &apos;s the least i can do to thank you for helping amy .
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
yeah , she &apos;s a special girl .
how is it for you , being single again ?
oh , honestly ...
i hate it .
it &apos;s like i &apos;ve forgotten how to date .
me , too .
i even let a friend of mine
take me into one of those speed @-@ dating things .
how was it ?
i didn &apos;t even go in .
i sat in this hotel lobby , watched all these lonely ,
desperate single people filing in ,
and then it hit me , i &apos;m one of them .
i know what you mean .
did you see that ? it spun three times and then i caught it !
you didn &apos;t see .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
i was distracting gabrielle .
oh , no , it &apos;s totally my fault .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie . go outside and do it again .
i promise , this time we &apos;re gonna watch .
come in .
wow , those are gorgeous .
well , i figured you &apos;d be too busy cooking
to manage a centerpiece .
well , you may not be a good cook ,
but you &apos;re certainly a tidy one .
don &apos;t worry . dinner &apos;s all taken care of .
we &apos;re having blanquette de veau
and a grand marnier soufflé .
that &apos;s very ambitious of you .
and when will bree be done making it ?
5 : 30 .
but i am re @-@ warming it all by myself .
oh , what &apos;s all this ?
mike was arrested for murder .
my god .
i mean , of course he &apos;s totally innocent .
i &apos;m just trying to help him find a lawyer .
oh , shouldn &apos;t , um ,
shouldn &apos;t his girlfriend be doing that ?
yeah . edie dumped him .
ok , i know how this looks ,
but i just feel bad .
he &apos;s just a friend now .
yes , yes , a friend
you sat by for six months ,
hoping he &apos;d wake up and ravish you again .
you are the only one allowed to ravish me these days .
so stop worrying .
orson , it &apos;s me again .
please call . we need to talk .
you always do the chips . i think you &apos;re stealing money .
well , i &apos;ll do the chips , you deal .
you got it .
guys , why has it been so long since we played poker ?
i really need this .
me too .
there &apos;s nothing more relaxing than
an afternoon of finger food and girl talk .
hi , ladies .
hey , how &apos;re ya doing ?
so , did you tell the police
you think orson killed monique ?
what ?
no , i did not .
and i don &apos;t plan to .
but mike is in jail .
you said yourself you thought orson did it .
i said i had concerns , concerns that have disappeared
now that mike has been arrested .
what ? you think mike is guilty ?
why don &apos;t we start that girl talk ?
i &apos;ll get the ball rolling . anybody have a yeast infection ?
they found monique &apos;s blood on the wrench
mike was trying to dispose of .
i mean , that hardly screams &quot; innocence . &quot;
her teeth were pulled !
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s worth telling the cops
she was messing around with a dentist ?
orsen was slipping it to the dead chick ?
mike is innocent.i know that in my heart .
we all have convictions , susan .
i believe mike &apos;s last one was for manslaughter .
ok , ok , we &apos;ve all made some excellent points
and blown off a little steam .
whoo , let &apos;s play some cards .
if you &apos;re sure orson is innocent ,
why don &apos;t we go through his things ?
where &apos;s his desk ? - at his office .
what did you think you &apos;d find there ?
i don &apos;t know . a blackmail letter .
a necklace made of teeth .
we &apos;re not playing cards , are we ?
nope .
i &apos;m certainly not playing with a woman who is
willing to let mike take the fall
for her psycho husband .
well , needless to say ,
i won &apos;t be cooking dinner for ian &apos;s parents .
fine . i &apos;ll cook myself.- good .
let me know if there are any survivors .
and if you take orson back ,
you do the same .
that was incredibly awkward .
i &apos;m sorry you both had to sit through it .
was it me ? was i out of line ?
no way i &apos;m taking sides .
this &apos;ll blow over .
you &apos;re right .
i hope so .
come on in , you &apos;re just in time .
thanks so much , rita .
i think it &apos;s such a good idea
that we all get together and talk ...
what is all this ?
we decided to stage a protest in front of art &apos;s house .
a protest ?
rita , i want the word &quot; pedophile &quot; to really stand out .
do we have any glitter ?
say &quot; molester . &quot; it sounds scarier .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought we were all gonna talk about
how to keep an eye on this guy .
we &apos;re past talking . the guy is a menace .
well , that &apos;s what we think , but we don &apos;t exactly have proof .
the youth center just fired him .
how much proof do you need ?
but , see , the only reason they fired him
is because people were gossiping .
and the only reason they &apos;re gossiping
is because of what i told mrs. mccluskey .
yeah , and you told me to spread the word .
so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant .
so , you wanna wait until he molests one of our kids ?
whose side are you on ? - knock it off .
remember , if it weren &apos;t for lynette ,
we never would &apos;ve found out about this creep .
she &apos;s our hero .
bye , daddy .
see you . have fun .
so i was thinking , you wanna grab a coffee
or something after class ?
i &apos;d love to grab a cup of coffee ... or something .
amy , you are so lucky
to have such a nice dad .
yeah , i know .
leave him alone .
excuse me ?
you heard me ? i don &apos;t want you dating him .
oh , sweetheart .
i have a feeling i know what this is about .
no , you don &apos;t .
i think i do .
you miss your mommy .
and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice
to somebody else .
but believe me , i &apos;m not trying to replace your mom .
well , i am .
and i have someone all picked out .
what ?
i want my dad to marry sherri &apos;s mom .
sherri from class ?
we &apos;re best friends . we have it all planned .
our parents are gonna get married ,
and then we &apos;ll be real sisters .
and your dad ? you care what he wants ?
my mom died .
all my dad wants is for me to be happy .
now , get in there and teach me how to work the runway .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re paying you for , right ?
orson ?
bree ?
orson .
why haven &apos;t you returned any of my calls ?
i was afraid you were calling to ask me for a divorce .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
they arrested mike for the murder of monique polier .
they did ?
the other night you wanted a chance to explain everything .
well , here it is , and i want it all .
if i find that you &apos;ve left anything out ,
then i will ask for that divorce .
ok .
you &apos;re working so hard , sherri .
you must really want to win this pageant .
more than anything .
well , i think dedication should be rewarded .
so i have a little surprise for you .
what is it ?
well , you know how the pageant starts
with a big opening number ?
this year , all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs .
and i &apos;ve arranged for you
to dance with your best friend , amy !
what &apos;s wrong , sweetie ?
well ...
... amy sucks .
well , i thought you two were practically sisters .
we are . but she still sucks .
and first impressions are everything . you said so yourself .
well , that &apos;s true.- and this is the opening number .
if the judges see me tripping over that klutz ,
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m gonna win .
that &apos;s a good point . now i wish i hadn &apos;t told amy .
you already told her ?
she was so excited .
well , she &apos;s your best friend .
why don &apos;t you just tell her the truth ? she &apos;ll understand .
what if she doesn &apos;t ?
well , friends come and go ,
but a crown is forever .
i never loved alma .
my mother pushed us together ,
and i was stupid enough to get her pregnant .
you had a child ?
alma miscarried a month after the wedding .
i was trapped.- well , you could have left her .
mother wouldn &apos;t hear of it . divorce is a sin .
so i stayed in the marriage ,
hoping i would come to feel
what i was supposed to .
i never did .
so i resigned myself to a life without love .
and then i met monique .
it was wrong . i didn &apos;t care .
i loved her more than i &apos;ve loved anyone ... until you .
so why couldn &apos;t you tell me this ?
because you told me about rex ,
how he cheated on you , how hurt you were .
bree , i needed you to feel safe with me .
so you stayed in a loveless marriage
because of your mother ?
i know how it sounds .
but after my father died ,
she was all i had .
his death caused me to suffer in a way that ...
i would have done anything for her .
埃尔瑞吉精神病院
she saw that weakness and she ran with it .
入院确认函
you &apos;ve got no idea how manipulative she can be .
she ruins lives .
i &apos;ve told you everything .
what happens now ?
well ,
first you pack up your things and come home ,
and then we toss your mother out on her evil ass .
god , i love you .
hi ! i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late ! where are your folks ?
they &apos;re not coming .
their plane was snowed in at o &apos;hare .
oh , well , that &apos;s too bad .
well , no harm done , then , huh ?
you &apos;re 40 minutes late .
but they &apos;re not here .
you didn &apos;t know that . and where &apos;s dinner ?
bree and i sort of had a fight , um ...
look , i &apos;m awfully sorry that i &apos;m late .
i had an emergency .
did this emergency have anything to do with mike ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that bree &apos;s husband
murdered the woman the cops think mike killed .
i went to his office ... - oh , for god &apos;s sake , susan .
i found evidence . look .
orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year .
doesn &apos;t that suggest he &apos;s some ... ?
i don &apos;t care !
tonight meant a great deal to me , and you blew it off .
i said i was sorry , ian .
i have to help mike .
i &apos;m all he &apos;s got .
actually , you &apos;re wrong .
he &apos;s got me .
what ?
tomorrow i &apos;ll hire the best lawyer in town to defend him ,
and i &apos;ll pay every cent of his bill .
you would do that for mike ?
yes . on one condition .
you can &apos;t see him anymore .
why ?
if you start visiting him , he &apos;ll fall in love with you again .
then you &apos;ll have to decide whose heart to break , his or mine .
as jealous ultimatums go , that &apos;s very flattering .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s necessary .
mike and i are done .
then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer .
you would get him the best lawyer in town ?
an absolute piranha .
do we have a deal ?
well , ok then .
you know , mike barely remembers me .
what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again ?
what a perfectly asinine question .
how could he not ?
god , i was only in the house 15 minutes .
are there more of them now ? - yep .
we don &apos;t want you in our neighborhood !
go ahead , say it . i know you want to .
this is all your fault . you should have listened to me .
i know .
but be fair , there is no way i could have anticipated this .
you tell people frankenstein &apos;s on the loose ,
then you &apos;re surprised to see torch @-@ wielding villagers ?
honey .
i &apos;m putting the kids to bed early .
i don &apos;t want them to see this .
is that an ambulance ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re doing this !
amy , don &apos;t you want me to have a chance ?
god , i hate you ! i hate you !
don &apos;t ever talk to me again !
hi , bill ?
i was wondering , do you have plans saturday night ?
excuse me , can you tell me what happened here ?
ma &apos;am , i need you to step back .
ok .
we &apos;re bringing in a female , late 30s .
get a crash cart ready . she &apos;s in cardiac arrest .
there he is !
stay out of here !
stop it ! stop it !
you can &apos;t do this to people . have you all lost your minds ?
excuse us for wanting to feel safe in our homes .
that &apos;s my home , and i don &apos;t feel safe now .
please , please , all of you , just leave this street . please !
i beg of you , go !
just get off my street !
please ! wait !
wait , art ! wait !
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re an idiot to take him back .
i am no longer interested in your opinion .
i thought i made that clear .
where are you sending me ?
we &apos;ve rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community .
it &apos;s our christmas gift to you .
so you &apos;re exiling me ?
cutting me off from my new grandchildren ?
that &apos;s our gift to them .
you think you can be rid of me that easily ?
it &apos;s over , mother . i told her everything .
oh , i doubt that very much .
you still have secrets , my boy .
so do you , mother .
and if you want them kept ,
you &apos;ll keep mine .
it &apos;s me . i have some bad news .
she &apos;s taking him back .
meet me on the corner in an hour . we need to deal with this .
i heard about rebecca on the news .
if there &apos;s anything i can do
to help with funeral arrangements
or help you call relatives ...
you must be feeling really guilty .
of course . i feel just terrible .
if you knew ... if you could just know how sorry i am .
you know , in a weird way ...
i should thank you .
my sister was a really wonderful person .
she always saw the best in me .
but there were things she couldn &apos;t see .
or chose not to ...
god love her .
what do you mean ?
i think you know
see , i always knew that i had to take care of rebecca .
so i could never let myself slip
and do something that would hurt her .
but now ...
... i &apos;m free .
and all because of you .
you can &apos;t stay here .
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m already packed .
where are you going ? - why ? you gonna write ?
well ...
goodbye , lynette .
you take care of that beautiful family of yours .
&lt; i &gt; there is a reason people can &apos;t wait for christmas , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and it has little to do with family reunions . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or curling up with a cup of eggnog . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or that unexpected kiss beneath the mistletoe . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or receiving a present from that special someone . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no , people look forward to christmas &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; because they know it &apos;s a time ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... for miracles . &lt; / i &gt;
hello , alma .
don &apos;t just stand there . tell me everything .
