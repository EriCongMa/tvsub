i don &apos;t owe harvey shit .
he may have gotten me out ,
but he and cameron put me in there in the first place .
you &apos;re right , you don &apos;t owe harvey ,
but you do owe me because i didn &apos;t have anything
to do with putting you in there ,
but i broke the law to get you out .
i came here to compliment you on getting rid of sheila sazs .
if she &apos;s not back by the start of trial ,
i &apos;m gonna assume you want to be brought up on charges .
i just stopped by to give you this restraining order
preventing you from contacting louis litt .
you &apos;re done driving a wedge between me and my people .
if i represent myself , every second i &apos;m up there
they &apos;re gonna see me as a lawyer .
and if she rattles you
for one of those goddamn seconds ,
they &apos;re gonna see you as a fraud
and they &apos;re never gonna see you as anything else .
did mike ross go to harvard law school or not ?
i &apos;d like to assert my fifth amendment right .
if i was on that jury , i &apos;d find you guilty .
they &apos;re not gonna let me change my goddamn lawyer
in the middle of a trial .
we need to figure out a way to make them ,
&apos;cause if we don &apos;t , we &apos;re gonna lose .
you have one last chance to save yourself .
call me before it &apos;s too late .
okay , so we have a plan for you
to start representing yourself .
we just need a way to rattle gibbs when we execute it .
i have a way , but ...
you &apos;re not gonna like it .
i &apos;m gonna call clifford danner to the stand .
no way , it &apos;s too risky .
harvey , listen to me--
he &apos;s angry and volatile
and in case you forgot ,
he &apos;s one of the people you were dumb enough
to tell your secret to .
i know all of that ,
but you said it yourself , we need sympathy ,
and no one is gonna get us more sympathy
than the innocent guy we got out of prison .
harvey , you said i needed to do this .
well , this is how i do it .
do you have faith in me or not ?
mrs. gloria danner ?
yes .
hi , my name is mike ross .
i &apos;m a lawyer at pearson specter litt and i was hoping--
i know who you are ,
and i know what you &apos;re doing here .
you &apos;ve come to get clifford to testify for you ,
but i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s not going to .
please , ma &apos;am , i promise you ,
the d.a. cannot reopen his case--
i &apos;m not talking about the district attorney .
my son &apos;s dead , mr. ross .
what ?
clifford was shot and killed three weeks ago , so ...
i &apos;m sorry , he can &apos;t help you .
hello ?
are you in the office ?
it &apos;s thursday night . i &apos;m watching my show .
well , then goddamn tivo it because i need your help .
it better be important if you &apos;re taking that tone with me .
and if this is about that mah @-@ jongg game--
i don &apos;t give a shit if it &apos;s mah @-@ jongg
or kung pao or chinese checkers .
this is the most important thing
that i &apos;m ever gonna ask you to do in your entire life .
give me an order .
i need you to pull whatever strings you have
to get me a transcript of mike &apos;s trial
and i need you to keep it to yourself .
mind if i ask what you need it for ?
because i need to know if we have a snowball &apos;s chance in hell
of winning this thing .
is defense ready to call its first witness ?
i am , your honor .
what ?
i &apos;m calling my witness .
does prosecution have a problem with that ?
objection , this is outrageous , your honor .
they can &apos;t switch attorneys in the middle of a trial .
and that would be true except for the fact
that i &apos;ve been co @-@ counsel on this case from day one .
co @-@ counsel ? what planer are you living on ?
the one where pearson specter litt is my attorney of record .
i have the employee directory right here .
my name is in it .
it &apos;s been there since the beginning of this trial ,
and if you wanted to object to me ,
you would have had to have done it
at the beginning of this trial .
then i want them waiving all rights to a mistrial
and i want it in the record .
your honor , i &apos;m not gonna be punished
just because she didn &apos;t understand
that i &apos;ve been representing myself this whole time .
he &apos;s got a point , ms. gibbs .
then i want them waiving all rights to a mistrial
based on him representing himself .
my pleasure , your honor , &apos; cause i don &apos;t expect
we &apos;ll be needing a mistrial at all .
then call your first witness .
defense would like to call gloria danner to the stand .
please state your name for the jury .
gloria danner .
mrs. danner ,
a number of years ago , your son clifford
was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison ,
is that right ?
yes .
for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
how do you know he didn &apos;t commit it
if he was convicted of it ?
because you proved he didn &apos;t .
mrs. danner , can you tell the jury
why it is that you &apos;re here today testifying
and not your son clifford ?
he was working late at the diner .
it was the only place he could get a job when he got out .
two men came in to rob the place ,
and when clifford tried to stop them ,
he was shot and killed .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i worked my whole life
to put him through school
and he ends up dying
in the back of that shit restaurant
in that shit part of town .
can you tell the jury why you agreed
to come share your story for me today ?
prison
ruined clifford &apos;s life ...
and if you had been our lawyer from day one ,
he never would have been convicted in the first place .
thank you , gloria .
no more questions , your honor .
mrs. danner ,
i happen to be familiar with your son &apos;s case .
and i understand that in order to reopen it ,
mr. ross risked increasing his sentence to life .
that &apos;s correct .
well , i &apos;d like to know how you &apos;d have felt
if he lost that gamble .
i &apos;d have been devastated .
and if that happened , how would you have felt
if you then found out
that mr. ross wasn &apos;t even a lawyer after all ?
objection , your honor ,
how many hypotheticals can she ask ?
that &apos;s okay .
i think everybody in this courtroom knows
how they would feel .
no more questions , your honor .
i wouldn &apos;t have cared what a piece of paper had to say ,
because mr. ross is the only lawyer i ever ran into
that ever gave a damn about my son .
mr. ross , would you care to call your next witness ?
i can &apos;t imagine anyone
being more eloquent than that , your honor .
defense rests .
having trouble with your closing ?
no , it &apos;s just part of the process .
would it make you feel better if i told you
that i have never felt more proud of my future husband
than i did watching you up there today ?
yes , it would .
good .
because i want to talk to you about your closing .
don &apos;t tell me you want me to go with jury nullification .
there is nothing wrong with getting a jury
to sympathize with you ,
and , mike , your parents died in a car accident .
who isn &apos;t gonna feel for a person like that ?
rachel , the only problem with me saying ,
&quot; let me off because tragedy struck me as a child &quot;
is i &apos;ve pretty much admitted that i &apos;m guilty .
no , the difference is that that accident is the reason
that you wanted to become a lawyer in the first place .
and they won &apos;t just understand it , they will love you for it .
how can you know that ?
because i love you for it .
tell them your story and i am telling you ,
they &apos;ll let you go .
louis , you wanted to see me ?
yeah , that was hours ago .
we need to talk . we need to talk right now .
about what ?
about the fact that
mike ross is all of a sudden representing himself .
and why exactly do we need to talk about that ?
because it means harvey thinks he &apos;s gonna lose .
you wanna walk me through that logic ?
harvey &apos;s never given up control of a case in his life ,
and if he &apos;s doing that now ,
it means he wants that loss on mike &apos;s record .
louis , at a time like this ,
harvey doesn &apos;t care about records .
bullshit . i read the transcript backwards and forwards .
he thinks he &apos;s gonna lose .
louis , what &apos;s really going on here ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .
if harvey thinks we &apos;re gonna lose ,
then we &apos;ll lose , and if that happens ,
you know who gibbs is coming after next .
louis , we will deal with that when and if she does ,
but i am telling you ,
harvey letting mike take the reins is not him giving up .
it &apos;s him growing up
and realizing he is not the one to bring this home .
do you want to talk about it ?
talk about what ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , maybe the fact
that mike is working on a closing
to keep himself out of jail
and you &apos;re not working on it with him .
there &apos;s nothing for me to do , donna .
it &apos;s in his hands .
in his hands ?
harvey , that was a trial maneuver .
it doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t help him when he needs you .
he doesn &apos;t need me .
he needs you more than ever .
no , he doesn &apos;t , and it &apos;s time for him
to put the clipboard down and get in the game .
harvey--
donna , this wasn &apos;t just
some move to slip testimony in .
this is mike &apos;s life .
it &apos;s his story and he needs to be the one to tell it .
everything he &apos;s done up until now has prepared him for this ,
and i &apos;m telling you ,
he &apos;s ready for it .
is defense ready for closing statements ?
mike ?
you okay ?
mr. ross ?
oh , uh , yes , your honor .
um , ladies and gentleman of the jury ,
i think most of us ...
you guys heard evidence earlier in the trial
that i have a photographic memory ,
and i do , but the way it works--
i don &apos;t just take a snapshot of something .
see , i read it
and then i understand it ,
and once i understand it ,
then i never forget it ,
but i &apos;ve been trying to memorize my speech ,
but i can &apos;t
because it &apos;s bullshit ,
because i ...
i am bullshit .
you see , the truth is--is that i am guilty of being a fraud .
my whole life i have wanted to be a lawyer
so that i could help people like clifford danner .
people who have no one else to fight for them .
no one who believes in them ,
but instead , all i &apos;ve done as a lawyer
is work night and day
to put money into the hands of rich people .
i was given a gift and i wasted it ,
and i &apos;m ashamed of myself .
and--and as a final insult ,
i paraded this mourning woman out in front of you
just as a way to get you to admire me .
i am so sorry , gloria .
and all i can say
is that i promise you ,
whether these people find me innocent or not ,
i am gonna spend the rest of my life
fighting for the clifford danners of this world .
i will not waste that gift again .
you could believe it or not ,
but i am a lawyer ,
and i always will be .
thank you .
well , it &apos;s an interesting thing , really ,
how criminals can play with our emotions .
mike ross is articulate
and persuasive and passionate
and listening to his closing argument ,
i almost want to let him go myself ,
except for one thing : he &apos;s a liar .
he didn &apos;t commute to harvard one day a week
as he so laughably claims .
he didn &apos;t go to college .
there is no paper record of his enrollment ,
no applications to law school ,
no picture in the yearbook ,
no class rankings ,
no one at all who even remembers him .
except for that one indebted friend
with a lot to lose ,
and if you believe his testimony ,
i got a bridge over brooklyn i &apos;d like to sell you .
and whether he says it or not ,
he &apos;s banking on the fact
that you are gonna think this is a victimless crime ,
but if you acquit him ,
you are giving permission to everyone to say
&quot; hey , i &apos;m gonna pretend to be a lawyer . &quot;
&quot; i think i &apos;m gonna say i &apos;m a doctor . &quot;
&quot; hell , you know what ?
today , i &apos;m gonna pose as a pilot . &quot;
imagine if one day you woke up on the operating table
to discover the man who was about to crack open your chest
is not really a doctor .
guilty .
guilty .
guilty .
make no mistake about it ,
mike ross thinks he &apos;s better than you .
he thinks he doesn &apos;t have to play by the same rules ,
but we know he does .
because , ladies and gentleman of the jury ,
mike ross ...
is a fraud .
mike ...
mike ...
mike .
she was good , harvey .
yeah , so were you .
you were great .
she was better . everything she said was true
and the jury knows it .
no they don &apos;t .
look , ever since the day i met you ,
you have always seen the good in people ,
and we only need one person on the jury
to feel that way about you .
and what if they don &apos;t ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
because we can &apos;t do anything about it anyways .
so , let &apos;s get out of here .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ?
i mean , i can &apos;t leave until that jury comes back .
mike , they might not come back for days .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you , harvey ,
but i can &apos;t leave here .
it &apos;s okay , harvey .
look ,
mike , if we really don &apos;t have time ,
i don &apos;t want to waste it here .
rachel , if i leave ,
all i &apos;m gonna be thinking about
is what &apos;s happening in that jury room .
then i am going to go and get us some food
and we &apos;re gonna have a bite to eat
because i &apos;m not gonna let this time go to waste .
okay .
what ?
what do you mean what ?
i want to know what you think .
i think i saw a heavyweight fight
that &apos;s gonna come down to the goddamn cards .
you see it any different ?
what i see is my fate in the hands of a jury ,
and i don &apos;t like it .
why the hell do you think
i cut so many deals instead of going to trial ?
well , the only deal that gibbs is going to cut
is the one that hangs us out to dry .
and i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i don &apos;t feel like just sitting by
while this thing goes to verdict .
you think i do ?
look , there &apos;s no other w--
hold on a second .
we could go get us a mistrial .
what good would that do ?
a mistrial &apos;s just gonna kick the can down the road
till mike gets tried again .
listen to me .
when mike wanted to represent himself ,
gibbs jumped out of her chair
saying that we were trying to get a mistrial .
then she demanded we waive our rights to one completely .
and the only reason she &apos;d do that
is because she doesn &apos;t have authorization
to try this case again .
which means ,
a mistrial isn &apos;t just kicking the can down the road .
no , it &apos;s blowing it to kingdom come .
the only problem is ,
we don &apos;t have grounds for a mistrial .
well , then you better go out and find some .
and you better do it before that jury comes back .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
my lawyer &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s not my problem .
then why did he tell me that
if i told you he couldn &apos;t make it ,
you &apos;d give me a continuance or something ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ll do , mr. diaz .
since perkins isn &apos;t here ,
i &apos;ll help you out .
instead of going to trial and winding up
with a five year sentence ,
i &apos;ll let you cop to three and a half right here .
five years ?
we stole some tvs .
for the third time , and that &apos;s five years .
i was only driving the car , man .
then you can drive yourself to prison , man ,
but i &apos;m not giving you a continuance .
hey , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt ,
but he doesn &apos;t give you a continuance , the judge does .
and you &apos;re entitled to one automatically
if this is the first time your attorney didn &apos;t show .
and who the hell are you ?
that &apos;s not your concern .
and this is not your concern .
yeah , well , i &apos;m making it my concern
since i don &apos;t like watching prosecutors
take advantage of unrepresented defendants .
all i &apos;m doing is offering the man a deal .
i &apos;m not taking advantage .
that is bullshit .
you know full well his lawyer didn &apos;t tell him
to ask you for a continuance .
he told him to ask the judge for one .
now you &apos;re gonna try and bully him into three and a half years
for what sounds to me like a simple misdemeanor theft .
you don &apos;t know shit about this case .
well , i &apos;m about to . hand over the case file .
i don &apos;t have to give you anything .
you &apos;re not his attorney .
mr. diaz , my name is mike ross .
now , do you want me to represent you
or do you want to stick with this asshole perkins
who didn &apos;t even show up to your hearing ?
he &apos;s my lawyer .
donna , i need your help and i need it right now .
what &apos;s going on ? is the jury back ?
no , i need to know if stephanie liston still works
at the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
she does , why ?
i need the names of the jurors .
harvey , if you &apos;re even thinking about tampering--
no , i &apos;m not thinking of tampering with the jury .
i just need to find grounds for a mistrial .
a mistrial ?
you told mike he killed it . was that a lie ?
no , it wasn &apos;t .
then why are you
so suddenly having doubts ?
it &apos;s called hedging .
no , it is called breaking the law
and i don &apos;t want any part of it .
goddamn it , donna . i &apos;m trying to protect mike .
then maybe you should be getting a mistrial legally
instead of having me do what you &apos;re asking .
we don &apos;t have time .
i don &apos;t care !
what the hell &apos;s wrong with you ?
me ?
yes , you .
whose side are you on ?
oh , don &apos;t you dare ask me that .
you know damn well that i would break the law for you and mike ,
but you are asking me
to have my friend do it ,
and i am not going to .
donna--
harvey , even if i did ask stephanie
and she said yes , which she never would ,
you would have to drag innocent people
through the mud to get this done .
and the harvey i know
isn &apos;t that kind of person .
donna , what is going on ?
why are you so upset ?
i &apos;m not upset .
when you say , &quot; i &apos;m not upset , &quot;
is that you acting ? because it sucks .
what do you want from me , louis ?
i want you to cut the bullshit and tell me what &apos;s wrong .
i just saw you leave harvey &apos;s office
and five seconds later , i saw him do the same thing .
okay , louis , what &apos;s wrong is harvey wants me
to get the names of the jurors from my friend
in the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
he &apos;s trying to tamper ?
he &apos;s trying to get a mistrial .
well , then why the hell aren &apos;t you helping him do it ?
what ?
you heard me .
why aren &apos;t you doing whatever you can do help him ?
i can &apos;t believe you just said that to me .
donna , listen to me , if harvey &apos;s doing this ,
it means he thinks he &apos;s going to lose .
and if he thinks he &apos;s gonna lose ,
it means he is gonna lose .
and if mike goes down ,
everybody goes down with him .
don &apos;t you care about that at all ?
i &apos;m getting a little tired of people asking me
whether i care or not . because i do ,
but not enough to push women and children aside
to get on a lifeboat .
so , if that &apos;s all you came in here to ask me ,
why don &apos;t you be on your way ?
okay , i got us some bread ,
cheese , a little bit of wine , and a picnic blanket .
so , i feel like we should just go outside--
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ?
did the jury come back ?
no , i , uh , i met a defendant .
he got caught in the act of some petty larceny ,
and , uh , they &apos;re trying to railroad him , so i--
so , you &apos;re taking a case ?
rachel , he tried to sell a couple of tvs
out of the back of a truck . now he &apos;s facing five years .
and somewhere in this building there are 12 people
deciding whether or not you &apos;re a fraud
and you &apos;re sitting here doing the exact thing
that they &apos;re accusing you of .
they were right in front of me .
his lawyer didn &apos;t show up--
what is wrong with you ?
whoa , rachel , hey--
don &apos;t you understand that i am scared ,
and that i am trying to be supportive
and to keep a brave face ,
but that i could lose you , mike ?
so , i understand you wanting to be here ,
but i don &apos;t understand you not wanting to be with me .
come here .
look , i &apos;m scared too .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t go home .
and i don &apos;t know how i got into this , but ...
i know that i need to do this , rachel .
you really meant what you said to the jury , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah .
and you said that you fell in love with me
because of me wanting to help other people .
well , this guy needs my help .
and it may be the last time i can do something like this .
well , then let &apos;s figure out a way to help him together .
what &apos;s for lunch , david ?
quinoa salad .
well , enjoy it ,
because it &apos;s gonna be your last meal as a u.s. attorney .
mike ross promised me
that if i gave him those phone records ,
he wouldn &apos;t say anything to anyone .
i &apos;m not mike ross ,
and the way i see it ,
there &apos;s no reason for me not to tell gibbs about your shady past
unless you give me a reason .
and how am i supposed to do that ?
you pack up your lunch ,
you take it down the street to the courthouse cafe ,
and you share a table with whatever juror shows up
when they break for coffee in about two hours .
what &apos;s this for ?
for when you buy juror number whatever a cup of coffee .
jesus christ , you want me to give you a mistrial ?
i do that , i could lose my job .
you &apos;re gonna lose your freedom in two hours if you don &apos;t .
this is blackmail .
i call it atonement ,
and today &apos;s the day you face the music .
you were right .
about what ?
i shouldn &apos;t have been willing to hurt innocent people
to get done what i needed to get done .
well , it sounds like you got it done anyway .
i did , and you &apos;re gonna get a call from vanessa
as soon as she gets me some pictures i need .
harvey , you just said that you shouldn &apos;t have been willing
to hurt innocent people , and--
i didn &apos;t hurt any innocent people , donna .
i found a guilty one .
well , then i will go tell jessica
and i will let you know the second vanessa calls .
donna .
what , harvey ?
thanks .
i can &apos;t believe we found that .
i can &apos;t believe you did .
rachel , this might give us the leverage
to make sure diaz doesn &apos;t do any jail time at all .
do you really think so ?
yeah , i do .
and it doesn &apos;t surprise me
&apos;cause i also think that you &apos;re gonna make a great lawyer .
well , then spending our time doing this
wasn &apos;t such a bad idea after all .
mr. diaz , are you ready to enter a plea ?
before we do , your honor , i &apos;d like to enter a motion
to invalidate the search of mr. diaz &apos;s vehicle .
what ?
the warrant was obtained
because of a phone call between my client and his cousin ,
and there &apos;s no evidence that mr. alexander
had authorization to tap that call .
your honor , we had other sources for our search warrant .
and what exactly were they ?
mr. alexander ?
objection , your honor .
ms. gibbs , this case isn &apos;t
under the justice department &apos;s jurisdiction ,
so , what exactly are you objecting to ?
i &apos;m objecting to the fact that this man is not a lawyer .
your honor , that is a lie .
and as we speak , a jury is finding him guilty .
and until they do , my bar number is active .
this is ridiculous , your honor .
he is making a mockery of this entire courtroom ,
and i urge you to at least delay this case
until his jury comes back .
your honor , the only reason i &apos;m representing mr. diaz ,
is because his court @-@ appointed lawyer didn &apos;t show up ,
and then that man attempted to railroad him
into an outrageous plea deal .
ms. gibbs , he may be a fraud in your court ,
but since he hasn &apos;t been convicted of anything ,
he isn &apos;t one in mine .
and unless mr. alexander here magically finds his voice ,
mr. ross &apos;s motion
to exclude the search of his clients vehicle passes .
is it true what that woman was saying ?
yes , they &apos;re deliberating on his fate right now .
i don &apos;t give a shit if they &apos;re deliberating .
is he a fake or not ?
you saw what he just did , and he &apos;s about to cut you a deal
from four years behind bars to maybe a few months .
so what do you think ?
what &apos;d he say ?
he &apos;s too pissed off to make a deal right now ,
but trust me , he &apos;ll calm down , and then he will .
mike , where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go try and make a deal of my own .
you ran out of there so fast
i didn &apos;t get a chance to talk to you .
what exactly do you want , mr. ross ?
i want to make a deal .
you finally ready to turn on mr. specter ?
nope , but i am ready to plead guilty
and never practice law again
if you agree
to not go after any of the partners at person specter .
that &apos;s the same bullshit your boss said to me
when i first met him .
you &apos;re done practicing ,
so i should just let you get away with it ?
why would i listen to you now
if i didn &apos;t listen to him then ?
because you &apos;ve got it written all over your face .
seeing me be a lawyer makes you sick .
right ? and if i win ,
i &apos;m gonna keep being a lawyer ,
and it &apos;s gonna make you sick for the rest of your life .
no deal . it &apos;s not a good enough reason .
okay , then let &apos;s try this one .
you &apos;ve been at the same level at the u.s. attorney &apos;s office
for a long time .
now , a person who can &apos;t get a conviction
against a man that everyone thinks is a fraud ,
well , that &apos;s a person who &apos;s going nowhere .
this is a chance for you to save face .
i don &apos;t need to save face
because they &apos;re gonna find you guilty .
are you sure about that ?
&apos;cause you couldn &apos;t convince one judge to make me stand down ,
so what makes you think you &apos;re gonna convince 12 jurors ?
you know what , mike ?
the truth is ,
you would have made a good lawyer ,
but you &apos;re not one ,
and i &apos;m gonna put you away .
what can i do for you , donna ?
harvey wanted me to let you know that
as long as they don &apos;t reach a verdict in the next few hours ,
you &apos;ll have a mistrial .
i &apos;ll have a mistrial ?
what &apos;s on your mind , donna ?
nothing .
i guess i just never thought i &apos;d see the day
when you thought harvey was gonna lose .
and who says i think harvey &apos;s going to lose ?
a mistrial says it .
no ,
it says i &apos;m not willing to take a chance on 12 complete strangers .
it says you don &apos;t have faith in him .
donna , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
don &apos;t i ? i know i &apos;m not a lawyer ,
but isn &apos;t it true that if mike gets found innocent ,
there &apos;s no double jeopardy , but if a mistrial happens ,
they might come after him again one day ?
yes , donna , that is true ,
but harvey and i are banking that never happens .
and what if it does ?
then i &apos;m sorry ,
but the truth is , mike ross is the reason
why we &apos;re in this mess in the first place ,
and if it &apos;s a choice
between his peace of mind down the road and mine today ,
i &apos;m choosing mine .
now , is that all ?
louis litt , what a coincidence ,
i was just about to call your office , say i was your cousin ,
and ask if you &apos;d decided to take me up on my offer .
before i give you an answer , i want to know ,
if i give you proof that harvey knew about mike ,
will you give me immunity ?
well , that depends .
what do you have ?
what do you mean , what do i have ?
i have me .
well , that &apos;s not good enough .
well , then what the hell did you come to me for ?
because i was expecting something more
than the testimony of a man who &apos;s saving his own ass ,
which gets me nothing .
nothing ? i &apos;d be giving you my word .
and i don &apos;t need your word . i need proof .
well , goddamn it , i don &apos;t have any proof .
well , then you &apos;re no good to me .
and now i &apos;m in the position of having to work that much harder
to get both you and your partners ,
so , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i need to get back to it , louis .
donna , i need you to start prepping a motion
for mike to ask for a mistrial ,
and we &apos;re gonna need to do it first thing in the morning .
harvey , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s gonna be a mistrial .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i just got off the phone with vanessa .
david green never showed .
whatever it is , louis ,
i don &apos;t have the time .
well , you better find the time
because anita gibbs just offered me a deal .
and i assume you told her to shove it up her ass .
i did , but what i really wanted to say was ,
&quot; where do i sign ? &quot;
what the hell did you just say to me ?
did you ever think for one second ,
what &apos;s gonna happen if mike gets convicted ?
mike is not gonna get convicted .
how could you be so sure ?
because i &apos;m gonna go get us
a goddamn mistrial .
that &apos;s not good enough .
i want to know how you &apos;re gonna do that .
none of your business .
it is my business .
if you &apos;re gonna go and break some more laws
like you did when you hired the fraud in the first place .
what the hell do you want , louis ?
you want me to give you permission to cut a deal ?
i want you to give yourself up .
are you out of your mind ?
no , i am in my mind .
you can &apos;t get a mistrial , that verdict comes back the wrong way ,
everyone in this entire firm goes to jail
because of what you did .
go home , louis .
no , no , no ,
i want you to say it .
you went out on your own , you hired a fraud ,
and this whole firm &apos;s paying for it .
shut the hell up .
you and you alone
are responsible for the carnage of what &apos;s to come .
louis--
just say it !
you listen to me . i may have hired a fraud ,
but you &apos;re the one who had the chance to turn him in
and you used his secret to get what you always wanted .
so , don &apos;t come here at the 11th hour
trying to blame me for having to sleep in the bed that you made .
i don &apos;t want to go to prison , harvey .
then get out of my way , and let me do what i do .
what are you doing here ?
i came to talk .
i gotta hand it to you ,
you would have made a good lawyer ,
but you &apos;re even better than i gave you credit for .
you got in my head .
you came here to take my offer ?
i came to make an offer of my own .
you said you were giving me a chance to save face ,
but i let you get off with no punishment .
as far as my career goes ,
i might as well have let them find you innocent .
what do you want ?
you plead guilty , do two years in prison ,
and i won &apos;t go after any of your friends .
there &apos;s no way i agree to prison time
for a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
we &apos;re not in the courtroom right now , mike ,
so let &apos;s cut the bullshit .
we both know you did this .
so if you don &apos;t want to pay ,
then you take me up on my original offer .
you do no time ,
and all i need in return is one name partner at your firm .
and i told you that &apos;s never gonna happen .
well , maybe you want to talk to your fiancé
because the look on her face says
she &apos;d rather throw one of them to the wolves
then see you in prison .
so it &apos;s up to you .
you take either one of my deals ,
or you take your chances with the jury .
just remember ,
tick tock .
what did she mean , &quot; either deal &quot; ?
she countered my offer .
how long ?
rachel--
how long would you have to be away for ?
two years .
no , mike .
no , you can &apos;t .
do you know
how much time i &apos;m facing if i &apos;m found guilty ?
you &apos;re not gonna be found guilty .
seven years .
you &apos;re not gonna be found guilty .
i saw you up there . you were amazing .
you were that same empathetic , brilliant man
that i fell in love with .
there &apos;s no way the jury didn &apos;t see that .
rachel , the jury is not in love with me .
what if all they saw when they looked at me
was the same fraud that i &apos;ve been
since the first day i took that job ?
is that why you &apos;re thinking about going to prison ?
because what ? you want to punish yourself
and that &apos;s your only way to stop feeling guilty ?
yes , maybe that &apos;s a part of it .
okay , well it sounds like it &apos;s all of it .
all i know , is it &apos;s the only sure way
to put this to bed and make sure that
the only person who is hurt by it is me .
what about me ?
because all i did was love you !
and if you take some deal that sends you to prison--
rachel , we can survive this--
goddamn it , mike , they were in on it too !
i &apos;m not gonna rat them out .
and i &apos;m not asking you to .
i &apos;m just asking you to have faith in yourself .
okay , i will .
where the hell were you ?
you mean why i wasn &apos;t at the cafe ?
i was just coming to the conclusion
that you could take that threat and shove it up your ass .
you think i &apos;m bluffing you ?
i don &apos;t give a shit whether you &apos;re bluffing or not .
it made me sick to let mike ross back into a court .
i &apos;m not letting that happen again .
i don &apos;t think you understand what &apos;s gonna happen to you
when i call anita gibbs tomorrow morning .
you never made a mistake ?
you never did something you regret ?
what do you think i &apos;m trying to fix right now ?
look , if you don &apos;t help me ,
making sure you never practice law again
isn &apos;t gonna be on my list of regrets .
you know , i &apos;ve heard a lot of people talk
about the great harvey specter , completely unbeatable .
from what i &apos;m seeing ,
you &apos;re just a bully who uses other people &apos;s fears
to get what he wants .
well , it &apos;s not gonna happen tonight ,
because mike ross is about to go to prison
and i &apos;m not going to stop him .
harvey , it &apos;s the middle of the night .
what are you doing here ?
i had to see you .
i know you said i couldn &apos;t do this anymore ,
but i need to talk to you .
talk about what ?
about what i have to do .
you &apos;re gonna turn yourself in , aren &apos;t you ?
louis , the jury didn &apos;t come back ,
and since they went home ,
i &apos;m going home .
so , whatever it is , it &apos;s gonna have to wait until tomorrow .
tomorrow could be too late .
too late for what ?
this is all his fault .
you didn &apos;t start it .
i didn &apos;t start it .
he started it .
i &apos;m not having this conversation
behind harvey &apos;s back .
that &apos;s okay .
i already had it to his face .
tried to get him to do the right thing
and turn himself in , but he wouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not going to convince him to do that .
i know , because he &apos;ll never be convinced .
which is why we need to go to gibbs together--
louis--
goddamn it , jessica ,
we don &apos;t have any time !
did it ever occur to you
that if mike gets found guilty ,
the first thing harvey is going to do
is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you ?
no , it didn &apos;t .
well , it occurred to me .
we turn on him now ,
we &apos;re not better than daniel hardman
or charles forstman
or any of those other people you despise .
don &apos;t you see ?
we could protect each other .
you don &apos;t want us to protect each other , louis .
you want someone to tell you
that what you &apos;re thinking is okay ,
and i &apos;m not going to do that .
jessica , please .
good night , louis .
so you want to turn yourself in
because some cheater called you a bully ?
no , donna , i want to turn myself in
because he was right . i &apos;m not unbeatable .
no , harvey , i think he made you feel guilty ,
and now you &apos;re not seeing clearly .
donna--
harvey , if it were anybody other than mike on trial
and you saw his closing ,
do you think that the jury would convict him ?
i don &apos;t know , donna , but i can &apos;t afford
to be wrong about this .
then let me as you a question :
why aren &apos;t you talking to dr . agard about this ?
how do you know about her ?
because i do .
and i also know that the last time you had
a huge decision to make , you went to her and not me .
because that was about business
and this is personal .
no , harvey ,
you didn &apos;t go to her because you know she won &apos;t try
to talk you out of this , but i will .
donna--
don &apos;t do it .
don &apos;t fall on your sword again .
i have to--
no , you don &apos;t .
we might not win .
you don &apos;t always have to be the hero .
i &apos;m not doing it to be the hero .
then why the hell are you doing it ?
because it &apos;s my goddamn fault .
no , harvey , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s mike &apos;s fault just as much as it is yours .
then why should i be the one to throw him under the bus ?
don &apos;t you get it ? i am not asking you
to throw him under the bus .
i am asking you
to believe that the two of you
are worthy of being found innocent .
and what if i can &apos;t do that ?
then you can march yourself down to gibbs &apos;s office
in the morning and turn yourself in .
but i don &apos;t want you to do that .
why not ?
because i think you &apos;re worthy .
and i don &apos;t want to lose you .
harvey ,
go to the courthouse in the morning ,
sit with mike until that verdict comes in ,
and show him that you have faith in him .
like i have faith in you .
hello ?
yeah , this is him .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
how &apos;s the jury back so early ?
oh , it &apos;s not the jury .
it &apos;s the prosecutor from the diaz case .
he wants to talk .
i may have hired a fraud ,
but you &apos;re the one who had the chance to turn him in ,
and you used his secret to get what you always wanted ...
mr. litt ...
so don &apos;t come in here--
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt ,
but your cousin gertrude &apos;s on the phone .
she said she needs to know
whether you found that old mixed tape of hers .
tell her i didn &apos;t .
tell her it must have gotten thrown out ,
and to never ask me about it again .
good .
what do you mean &quot; good &quot; ?
i been wanting to tell anita gibbs to go to hell
since this whole thing started .
mr. ross ,
i &apos;d like to make your client an offer .
we &apos;re listening .
we don &apos;t want you , mr. diaz .
you said you were just driving the truck and i believe you ,
and we already have the two gentleman
who committed the actual felony .
so , all you have to do is testify against them ,
and you walk .
what ?
holy shit . no jail time ?
no jail time .
okay that &apos;s enough .
i need a moment with my client .
no , i don &apos;t need a moment .
i &apos;ll take it .
mr. diaz , listen to me .
testifying against your friends may not seem like a big deal
right now , but it &apos;s something you are gonna have to live with
for the rest of your life .
i don &apos;t owe them anything ,
and if i can get myself off , that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
he &apos;s only offering you this
because he doesn &apos;t have a case against you .
he &apos;s a two @-@ time loser . i &apos;ll make a case against him .
mr. diaz ...
give me the pen .
you are making a huge mistake .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t think so ,
and if you were in my shoes , you &apos;d do the exact same thing .
i would never send my friends to prison .
yeah , well , they find me guilty ,
they &apos;re gonna send my friends to prison anyways .
harvey , thank god .
the jury came back . we have an hour .
where &apos;s mike ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s the matter ?
harvey ?
i have to go .
another back , right ?
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m ready to take your deal .
which one ?
