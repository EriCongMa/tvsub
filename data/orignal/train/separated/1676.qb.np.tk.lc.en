ok , we &apos;ve got the power to the laser .
i should &apos;ve brought an umbrella .
what for ? it &apos;s not gonna rain .
i know that .
but with skin as fair as mine , moon burn is real possibility .
that &apos;s a &quot; bazinga , &quot; right ?
one of my best , don &apos;t you think ?
howard , do you want to double @-@ check the equatorial mount on the laser ?
we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility .
you got it .
oh , raj , no .
billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet
and filling it with pictures of naked women ,
so we don &apos;t have to peep through windows .
it &apos;s not like that .
i &apos;m watching someone &apos;s tv .
the good wife is on .
i tell you , this is my new grey &apos;s anatomy .
leonard , leonard .
what is that ? what is that ?
relax , it &apos;s just a dirty sock .
how on earth can you say
&quot; dirty sock &quot; and &quot; relax &quot; in the same sentence ?
sheldon , the world is filled with dirty discarded socks .
not my world .
hey , you know who &apos;d really dig seeing this experiment ? penny .
i wasn &apos;t aware that lunar ranging was her thing .
although , i suppose the retro @-@ reflector left on the moon
by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object .
why don &apos;t you ask her to come up ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s still a little weird since , you know ...
she dumped you ?
she didn &apos;t dump me .
we were just in different places in the relationship .
i fail to see how a relationship
can have the qualities of a geographic location .
oh , it &apos;s very simple .
leonard was living in a little town called &quot; please don &apos;t leave me &quot;
while penny had just moved to the island of &quot; buh @-@ bye . &quot;
screw you guys .
i &apos;m gonna go see if she &apos;s home .
if it &apos;s not too much trouble ,
i &apos;d like to point this at the moon now .
wait a second .
the good wife is crying .
something &apos;s very wrong .
本季完
oh , hi . what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
it &apos;s pretty cool .
we &apos;ve got a two @-@ meter parabolic reflector and everything .
i thought you might want to see it .
that makes no sense .
how can you bounce stuff off the moon ?
there &apos;s no gravity .
uh , leonard ,
this is zack . zack , leonard .
hey .
oh , sorry , i didn &apos;t know you were busy . maybe another time .
yeah , maybe .
hey , i want to see this laser thing .
oh , but what about the party ?
it &apos;s a surprise party-- doesn &apos;t matter when we get there .
right .
okay , well , yeah , come on up .
so , how &apos;d you guys meet ?
my company designs the menus for the cheesecake factory .
your company ?
well , my dad . but me and my sister are vps .
so ... menus .
i know it sounds easy , but there &apos;s a lot of science that goes into designing them .
happy now ? i &apos;m moving the dirty sock .
thank you .
raj , keep an eye out for the other one .
hey , guys , this is my friend zack .
hello . zack .
whoa !
is that the laser ?
it &apos;s bitchin &apos; .
yes .
in 1917 , when albert einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper
&quot; zur quantentheorie der strahlung , &quot; his fondest hope
was that the resultant device be bitchin &apos; .
well , mission accomplished .
let me explain what we &apos;re doing here .
um , in 1969 , the astronauts on apollo 11
positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon , and we &apos;re going to shoot a laser off
one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier .
oh ! that &apos;s very cool .
one question .
how can you be sure it won &apos;t blow up ?
the laser ?
the moon .
see , now this is a man for penny .
that &apos;s a great question , zack .
no , it &apos;s not .
sheldon !
play nice .
it &apos;s not a great question .
how could somebody possibly think we &apos;re going to blow up the moon ?
that &apos;s a great question .
don &apos;t worry about the moon .
we @-@ we set our laser to stun .
smart .
now , we &apos;ll be able to see the beam when it leaves ,
but it won &apos;t be strong enough when it comes back
to be seen by the naked eye .
naked .
right . uh ... funny .
uh , that device , there , will measure the photons that return
and let us see it on this computer .
raj , get them some glasses .
cool , it &apos;s gonna be in 3 @-@ d ?
preparing to fire laser at the moon .
make it so .
there it is . there &apos;s the spike !
2.5 seconds for the light to return .
that &apos;s the moon ! we hit the moon !
that &apos;s your big experiment ?
all that for a line on the screen ?
yeah , but , uh , think about what this represents .
the fact that we can do this is the only way
of definitively proving that there are man @-@ made objectson the moon ,
put there by a member of a species
that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane .
what species is that ?
i was wrong .
penny can do better .
okay , guys , thank you , it &apos;s been fun .
yeah , thanks .
should we invite them to the party ?
no , just keep walking .
he must be very skilled at coitus .
i &apos;m telling you , dude , the only way
to feel better about penny going out with other guys
is for you to get back on the whores .
horse .
what ?
the phrase is &quot; get back on the horse , &quot;
not &quot; whores . &quot;
that &apos;s disgusting , dude .
no , it &apos;s not ...
never mind .
he is right , though .
if you want , i can turn you on to this great new
dating site i found .
no , thanks .
you sure ? they say they can find a match for anybody .
have they found a match for you ?
tons . i &apos;ve had , like , eight dates in the last month .
and 12 if you count the ones who showed up and left .
i can &apos;t bring the nitrogen tank down .
why not ?
all right , let me restate that .
it &apos;s very heavy , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;ll help you .
thank you .
lift with your knees , not your back .
good night .
you know what would be fun ?
signing sheldon up for online dating .
yeah , right .
no , think about it .
we make it an experiment .
like when frankenstein &apos;s monster
was lonely and he found a wife .
he didn &apos;t find a wife .
they built him a wife out of dead body parts .
okay , we &apos;ll call that plan b.
coming !
damn you , you rat bastard .
are you drunk ?
zack was a perfectly nice guy , and then you ruined him !
how did i ruin him ?
&apos;cause in the olden days , i never would &apos;ve known he was so stupid .
come on , he wasn &apos;t that stupid .
yes , he was ! he thought you were gonna blow up the moon !
okay , yeah , he &apos;s stupid .
he spent the entire night bragging
about how he invented the word &quot; appe @-@ teasers . &quot;
how is that my fault ?
you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots .
now , come with me .
wh @-@ where are we going ?
we &apos;re gonna have sex .
why ? i mean , okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
put on your noise @-@ canceling headphones ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s gonna get loud .
oh ! not this again .
in what universe is this low @-@ pulp ?
good morning , penny .
what , do you have eyes in the back of your head ?
when one gets beaten up every other day in school ,
one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing .
incidentally , one can get beaten up in school
simply by referring to oneself as &quot; one . &quot;
i &apos;m making english muffins .
would you like an english muffin ?
oh , thanks , i &apos;m not hungry .
fyi ,
my noise @-@ canceling headphones proved ineffective last night .
yeah , sorry about that .
as a native texan , i must say i &apos;ve never heard the phrase &quot; yee @-@ haw &quot;
used in quite that context .
oh , god .
&quot; oh , god . &quot;
that i &apos;ve heard on multiple occasions .
in what universe is that lightly toasted ?
this has to be the worst day of my life .
good morning , leonard .
how many times have i asked you not to do that ?
counting this instance ? 317 .
where &apos;s penny ?
she returned to her apartment .
i presume to shower and vomit .
not necessarily in that order .
i wonder why she didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye .
are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior ?
i know . i just thought as an outsider ,
you might be able to provide a fresh perspective .
i have no difficulty believing you &apos;re not butter .
oh , hey .
oh , hi .
um , i gotta run . early shift .
okay , i &apos;ll walk down with you .
so , last night was fun , huh ?
yeah , it must have been .
i just threw up in my closet .
bummer .
anyway , i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie .
oh , yeah , tonight &apos;s not great for me .
doesn &apos;t have to be tonight .
i &apos;m free pretty much always .
leonard , last night was a mistake .
when you say &quot; mistake , &quot; do you mean a fortunate mistake ,
like the discovery of penicillin ?
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i was drunk , i was lonely , i hated zack .
can we just forget it ever happened ?
no , it &apos;s pretty well imprinted on my brain .
especially the whole rodeo thing .
oh , god !
so , that &apos;s it ?
wham , bam , thank you , leonard ?
look , i said i &apos;m sorry . can &apos;t you please let it go ?
how am i supposed to let it go ?
you used me for sex !
morning , mrs. gunderson .
good morning , leonard .
or should i say &quot; yee @-@ haw &quot; ?
holy crap .
what ?
we finally have proof that aliens walk among us .
excuse me ?
the dating site matched a woman with sheldon .
you &apos;re kidding .
an actual woman ?
yeah , look . breasts and everything .
trust me , breasts doesn &apos;t necessarily mean woman .
since when ?
i &apos;ll show you a picture
of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime .
leonard , you gotta see this .
we found a match for sheldon .
great .
maybe she can have sex with him , and then walk out on him
the next morning without so much as a &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
do you know what he &apos;s talking about ?
nope . why don &apos;t you ask him ?
leonard , what are you talking about ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
that was a lousy suggestion .
whatever . right now ,
dr. sheldon cooper has to send an e @-@ mail
to his perfect match .
&quot; greetings , fellow life @-@ form ... &quot;
if she can do it , i can do it . if she can do it , i can do it .
if she can do it , i can do it .
i can &apos;t do it .
hello ?
oh , hi . hey .
hi , leslie .
leonard hofstadter . what &apos;re you doing here ?
uh , i know ! it &apos;s been a while !
yeah , 18 months .
right . right .
so how you doing ?
fine . you ?
uh , not bad .
you remember when we used to have sex
and you said that it didn &apos;t mean anything , it was just for fun ?
yeah .
you , uh , want to do that again ?
what happened ? blondie dumped you ?
she didn &apos;t dump me .
we were just in different places in the relationship .
right .
um ... anyway , apparently ,
it &apos;s okay to go back to people you &apos;re no longer seeing
and have recreational sex with them .
so , what do you say ?
let me think about it .
she &apos;s not coming back .
she wants to meet us .
not us . him .
yes , but him doesn &apos;t even know about her .
well , him about to find out about her .
really ? us gonna tell him ?
who &apos;s going to tell whom about what ?
sheldon .
hey . hi .
your surprise confuses me .
i live here .
right .
so , listen , what are you doing tomorrow afternoon ?
be more specific .
4 : 30 .
that &apos;s not afternoon .
that &apos;s preevning .
what ?
it &apos;s a time of day i invented .
it better defines the ambiguous period
between afternoon and evening : preevning .
i &apos;m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need .
right , okay .
what are you doing tomorrow preevning ?
well , tomorrow &apos;s saturday .
saturday night is laundry night .
so i &apos;ll be spending the preevning pre @-@ sorting
and pre @-@ soaking .
okay , what if i were to tell you , tomorrow , at 4 : 30,
you could meet a woman
who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate ?
i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air ,
exhausted by your constant tomfoolery .
but it &apos;s true .
but we @-@ we put all your vital information into this dating site ,
answered all their questions just like you would ,
and they found a match for you . her name is amy farrah fowler .
please .
even assuming you could answer any question the way i would ,
the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum .
and that &apos;s exactly the answer we gave to the question :
&quot; what is your attitude towards online dating ? &quot;
howard wanted to write &quot; mumbo jumbo , &quot; but i said no .
our sheldon would say &quot; hokum . &quot;
come on , where &apos;s your scientific curiosity ?
well , most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe
while the rest of it &apos;s wondering why i &apos;m having this conversation with you .
okay , how about this .
even spock had a date once every seven years .
he didn &apos;t date .
it was pon farr .
his blood boiled with mating lust .
well , why @-@ why don &apos;t you start with a cup of coffee ,
and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later .
i don &apos;t drink coffee .
all right , you can have a hot chocolate .
as i will not be engaging in this nonsense , my choice of beverage is moot .
but for the record ,
i only drink hot chocolate in months with an &quot; r &quot; in them .
why ?
what &apos;s life without whimsy ?
okay , i &apos;m out .
sheldon , i &apos;ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof
somewhere in your apartment .
unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl ,
it will remain there forever .
you &apos;re bluffing .
are you willing to risk it ?
curse you .
30 feet .
oh . hey , leonard .
i was a perfectly happy , geeky , little lonely guy ,
and you ruined me !
are you drunk ?
come on . we &apos;re gonna have sex , and it &apos;s not gonna mean a thing !
are you out of your mind ? !
i &apos;m really starting to think there &apos;s a double standard here .
in a few minutes ,
when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise ,
how would you prefer i do it ?
the standard &quot; i told you so &quot; ?
the classic &quot; neener @-@ neener &quot; ?
or just my normal look of haughty derision ?
you don &apos;t know we &apos;re wrong yet .
haughty derision it is .
excuse me .
i &apos;m amy farrah fowler . you &apos;re sheldon cooper .
hello , amy farrah fowler .
i &apos;m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in
by unsupportable mathematics
designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely .
additionally , i &apos;m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock .
if that was slang , i &apos;m unfamiliar with it .
if it was literal , i share your aversion to soiled hosiery .
in any case , i &apos;m here because my mother and i have agreed
that i will date at least once a year .
interesting .
my mother and i have the same agreement about church .
i don &apos;t object to the concept of a deity ,
but i &apos;m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance .
well , then you might want to avoid east texas .
noted .
now , before this goes any further ,
you should know that all forms of physical contact
up to and including coitus are off the table .
may i buy you a beverage ?
tepid water , please .
