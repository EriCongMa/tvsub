easy .
sorry .
careful .
careful .
fairy dust is the most ...
precious substance in all the land .
its magic is what powers the world .
this is the year &apos;s supply .
we must be cautious .
i know .
because next year , you &apos;ll be doing this alone .
i @-@ i &apos;ll still be picking up dust ?
i thought i &apos;d be a fairy godmother by then .
oh , nova .
you really are a dreamer .
your journey is just beginning .
can you make it home from the mines with all the dust safe ?
okay .
this one &apos;s ready .
no , it &apos;s too early , watchy .
this unit isn &apos;t scheduled to hatch till sundown .
well , someone &apos;s eager to get out before the rest of his brothers .
welcome to the world , dwarf .
uh , excuse me , leroy .
uh , do you mind scooting over a seat
so walter and i could sit together ?
if i wanted to sit there , i would &apos;ve sat there .
you want this seat , try dragging your sorry asses
out of bed a little earlier .
you &apos;re a real ray of sunshine as--
congrats .
just lost my appetite .
seat &apos;s all yours .
excuse me .
can i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt your morning ,
but i just wanted to remind everyone
that a very special occasion is upon us--
miners day .
as always , the nuns of storybrooke
are hoping that everyone will get involved
and will help sell their exquisite candles .
all we need are a few energetic volunteers .
so who wants to join me ?
leroy , you wanna volunteer ?
i want to leave , sister . you &apos;re blocking the door .
of course .
uh , you know , if you wanted to help , it could really be a--
oh , yeah . right .
quite a team we &apos;d make .
town harlot , town drunk .
the only person in this town that people like less than me
is you .
if you &apos;re coming to me , you &apos;re screwed .
hey , mind if i join you ?
so what the hell is miners day ,
and why are you beating yourself up over it ?
it &apos;s an annual holiday celebrating an old tradition .
the nuns used to make candles
and trade them with the miners for coal .
coal ? in maine ?
if they were mining for lobster , i &apos;d understand .
look , i don &apos;t know . now they use it as a fund @-@ raiser .
it &apos;s an amazing party .
everyone loves it .
it doesn &apos;t seem like everyone loves it .
it &apos;s not miners day .
it &apos;s me .
last week , i had ten volunteers . this week , they all dropped out .
you think this is about what happened with david ?
oh , i know it is .
a few of them told me as much .
i &apos;ve never ...
been a homewrecker before .
it &apos;s gonna blow over .
you made a mistake with david . it happens .
but you don &apos;t have to do charity
to try to win people &apos;s hearts back .
i have to do something .
and this is the best i can do .
love ruined my life .
sheriff swan .
yeah . i &apos;ll be right down .
well , apparently , duty calls .
hang in there .
and if there &apos;s anything i can do to help , i will .
i know . thank you .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
it just slipped out of my hand . i--
no problem at all .
i really am so sorry .
i was so busy trying to get the lights to work
that i didn &apos;t realize
i was about to knock it off the ladder .
let me take a look at those lights for ya .
here &apos;s your problem .
you &apos;re overloading the transformer .
you kept messing around with these lights ,
the whole thing could &apos;ve blown up on you .
then i guess that makes you my hero .
i &apos;m nobody &apos;s hero , sister .
you can just call me astrid .
i call everybody &quot; sister . &quot;
i &apos;m leroy .
how did you do that ?
are you an electrician ?
i &apos;m in the custodial services game .
that &apos;s ... wonderful .
no , it &apos;s not .
what i really wanted to do ...
was sail .
i even bought a boat .
it &apos;s a real clunker . i was gonna fix it up ,
sail around the world , say good @-@ bye to this hellhole .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sister .
it &apos;s okay .
you know , someone once told me
you can do anything as long as you can dream it .
you really think so ?
sure .
look how easily you fixed those lights .
i bet you could do anything .
i should , uh , get back to the volunteer center .
nice to meet you , leroy .
you mind if i take a look , too ?
what for ?
well , just because i got fired from the &quot; mirror &quot;
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t do a little freelance reporting .
so what do we got here ?
gym teacher found this thing on the side of the road , abandoned ,
engine running , no one around .
registered to kathryn nolan .
she &apos;s m.i.a.
kathryn nolan ,
whose husband very publicly left her ?
i mean , the story writes itself .
if i get a scoop like that ,
the &quot; daily mirror &quot; would have no choice but to take me back .
calm down , tiger . you don &apos;t work for regina anymore .
kathryn got accepted to law school in boston .
maybe after david dumped her , she decided to leave town .
car broke down . she hitched the rest of the way .
that &apos;s what i would do if i was running away from my problems .
and , uh , would you leave your clothes in the car ?
time to pull kathryn &apos;s phone records
and find out who she spoke to last .
yeah , you know , if you go through the sheriff &apos;s department
it &apos;ll take you days to get those .
i &apos;ve got a contact over at the phone company
who used to help me ot when i was at the newspaper .
i can get those in a couple hours .
great .
call me the minute you get your hands on those phone records .
there he is .
time to break the news .
you really think he doesn &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m about to find out .
arms up .
what am i ?
you &apos;re a dwarf .
what am i doing ?
being cleaned .
who is the woman i saw ?
what woman ?
the one i saw right before i hatched .
she was beautiful . i want to see her again .
ha ! you must be dreaming .
there are no female dwarfs .
dwarfs don &apos;t fall in love ,
dwarfs don &apos;t get married ,
and dwarfs don &apos;t have children .
why do you think you were hatched from an egg ?
then what do we do ?
we work .
and we like it ?
we love it . we even whistle while we do it .
we mine the diamonds that get crushed into dust
that give light to the world .
you and your seven brethren
will bring joy to yourselves and to everyone .
come on .
this is your team . these are your brothers .
everyone , grab an ax .
it &apos;ll give you your dwarf name .
the ax never lies , dreamy .
okay , folks , grab a lantern and move out .
today is the first day of the rest of your lives .
welcome to the mines !
where can i sign up ?
what ?
i want to volunteer to sell candles .
no , you don &apos;t .
you made that very clear this morning at granny &apos;s .
maybe i saw the light .
i mean , maybe somebody showed it to me .
what difference does it make , sister ?
it looks like you can use all the help you can get .
okay , i need help manning the candle booth .
no swearing , no drinking ,
and i get to call all the shots .
you ordered how many tanks of helium ?
i meant to order 12 .
you ordered 12 dozen .
return them .
there are no refunds .
we needed that money . you knew that .
you know how he feels about us .
you fix this , sister astrid . you fix it now .
hey .
what &apos;s the problem ?
the problem is i &apos;m an idiot .
we get a stipend each year for expenses ,
and it &apos;s all carefully budgeted
except for the part where i spent it all on helium .
and now we can &apos;t pay our rent .
so you &apos;ll make it up
when you get your next stipend .
which isn &apos;t till next month .
the rent is due next week .
and the only income we have are these candles .
well , so how many do you need to sell ?
like , a thousand .
how many did you sell last year ?
42 .
ask your landlord to cut you a break .
oh . mr. gold doesn &apos;t offer much leeway .
mr. gold &apos;s your landlord ?
if we miss a payment , we &apos;re out .
and then they &apos;ll reassign us ,
and we &apos;ll have to leave storybrooke .
no , you won &apos;t .
you know why you only sold 42 last year ?
because you didn &apos;t have me .
this year we &apos;re going to sell all of them .
leroy ,
i guess you really are my hero .
she &apos;s just gone ?
you really don &apos;t know anything , do you ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t understand .
wh @-@ what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m trying to find out .
what can you tell me ?
when was the last time you spoke to kathryn ?
yesterday afternoon .
okay , look , i know there has been lies
and deceit ,
and i &apos;m really not judging you ,
but is that the truth ?
yes . i haven &apos;t spoken to her since we ...
i ended things .
and i came home yesterday , and all her things were gone .
i assumed she was going to boston .
that &apos;s what she told me .
am i a suspect or something ?
no . i know when people are telling the truth , david ,
and you are .
she hasn &apos;t even been gone 24 hours .
she &apos;s not even technically missing .
but if she is , trust me ,
i will find her .
hello , sidney ?
those phone records you wanted--
i have them .
and i think you &apos;ll find them quite helpful .
come on .
help !
someone !
oh , thank you .
it &apos;s you .
do we ... know each other ?
you &apos;re the woman i saw in my dreams
right before i hatched last year .
you &apos;re 1 ?
i know . i look young for my age .
oh , no !
the fairy dust !
i &apos;m an idiot .
all i ever wanted to be was a fairy godmother .
that was my dream ,
but i can &apos;t even pick up fairy dust alone .
i &apos;m so clumsy .
no , you &apos;re not .
i think you &apos;d make a great fairy godmother .
you really think so ?
i believe you can do anything you want ,
as long as you can dream it .
i &apos;m nova .
i &apos;m dreamy .
you know , dreamy , as fairies ,
we get to spend very little time in your world ,
and i was thinking about making a stop on my way back .
have you ever been to see the fireflies ?
i barely ever get out of the mines .
oh , i @-@ i @-@ i heard it &apos;s beautiful ,
that they come out just after sunset on firefly hill .
i was going to see them tonight on my way back .
oh , sounds fun .
have a good time .
dreamy ?
thanks .
you &apos;re my hero .
buy your miners day candles here !
handmade by storybrooke &apos;s very own nuns !
light your way to a good cause
by buying a candle .
this isn &apos;t working .
you &apos;re right . we should pack it up .
now you &apos;re quitting ?
if the customers won &apos;t come to us ,
we gotta go to them ,
door to door .
if they hate us here ,
what makes you think they &apos;ll like us in their homes ?
exactly . they &apos;ll pay us just to leave .
what the hell are you doing ?
what &apos;s happening ?
i just got off the phone with kathryn &apos;s school in boston .
registration was this morning , and she never showed up .
something did happen .
it looks that way .
oh , emma , help me out ! what &apos;s more sympathetic--
scarf or no scarf ?
s @-@ scarf .
okay .
come on . we &apos;re on a schedule .
thank you . gotta go .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
you &apos;re looking for a suspect , someone with a motive .
pixie cut over there has got one a mile high .
she had nothing to do with anything .
trust me .
but she &apos;s the one--
trust me . i know her .
just get me those phone records .
hi . we &apos;re selling candles for miners day .
we &apos;re not interested .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you &apos;ve barely touched your food .
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t eat . i can &apos;t sleep .
i don &apos;t feel at all like myself .
maybe i should have doc take a look at me .
you &apos;re gonna trust a dwarf
that got his medical degree from a pickax ?
i wouldn &apos;t worry about it . dwarves don &apos;t get sick .
it must be in your head .
it &apos;s not in his head . it &apos;s in his heart .
you &apos;re in love .
oh , that &apos;s impossible .
dwarves can &apos;t fall in love .
trust me .
i know love , and ...
you &apos;re in it .
what &apos;s it like ?
it &apos;s the most wonderful and amazing thing in the world .
love is hope .
it fuels our dreams .
and if you &apos;re in it ,
you need to enjoy it ,
because love doesn &apos;t always last forever .
but if love &apos;s so great ,
then why do i feel so bad right now ?
you need to be with the person you love .
yeah , but how do i know she feels the same way ?
all she talked about was going to see some fireflies ,
not loving me .
what--what did she tell you about these fireflies ?
uh , that she was gonna go see them on the hilltop tonight ,
that she heard they were the most beautiful sight in all the land .
what ?
she wasn &apos;t telling you about the fireflies .
she was inviting you to go be with her .
you think so ?
i &apos;ve had my heart broken enough
to know when somebody &apos;s reaching out .
now go . find your love .
find your hope .
find your dreams .
sister astrid ?
hi .
i have to talk to you .
see , i have some bad news .
oh , no .
what is it ?
the bad news is that ...
that ...
you nuns are gonna be real busy making candles ,
&apos;cause me and mary margaret just sold them all .
you &apos;re not losing the convent . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
how could you tell astrid
that we sold all those candles ? that is $ 5,000 , leroy .
$ 5,000 that we don &apos;t have .
don &apos;t worry about it , all right ?
i got a plan .
what plan ? a plan like going door to door
and having everyone in town laugh in our faces ?
just give me till the end of the day .
i &apos;ll figure something out .
and why is this so important to you ?
the nuns ...
they &apos;re gonna have to leave . hmm .
oh , my god .
you like her .
she is a nun , leroy .
could you possibly pick anyone any less available ?
says the girl who went after a married guy ?
at the end of the day , you &apos;re no better than i am .
you got your reasons for being here .
i got mine .
and when i say i &apos;m gonna get that $ 5,000,
i &apos;m gonna get that $ 5,000 .
i didn &apos;t think you were gonna show up .
i was afraid i was too late .
well , you did cut it pretty close .
come on .
look at all those lights .
are those the fireflies ?
no !
that &apos;s the village .
and beyond that , all the lights of the kingdom .
you &apos;ve seen a lot of this world , haven &apos;t you ?
from a distance , yes .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
flying over the world and being a part of it
aren &apos;t exactly the same thing .
well , at least you &apos;ve seen the world .
me--i live in the mines , underground .
all i ever see is diamonds and dirt and dwarves .
you know ...
we could see it together .
get a boat , sail all over ,
explore everything the world has to offer .
oh ! look !
okay , let &apos;s do it .
tomorrow night , after i drop off the dust ,
let &apos;s meet back here .
we &apos;ll run off together .
we &apos;ll see the world .
sounds like a dream come true .
now i know it &apos;s a bit of a fixer @-@ upper .
could probably use a new coat of paint ,
a few spritzes of febreze here and there .
but you can &apos;t tell me
that $ 5,000 &apos;s not a reasonable price for this beauty .
$ 3,000 , i think .
i need $ 5,000 .
you need $ 5,000 .
to what do we owe this specificity ?
trying to help out a friend .
oh , i see .
look , you don &apos;t even have to pay me anything .
just forgive one month &apos;s rent for the nuns .
the nuns ?
you can have the boat . they &apos;ll pay you back eventually .
it &apos;s a good deal . you get everything .
so that &apos;s what this is about .
come on . you &apos;re a rich guy . you can afford to give them time
to make up one month &apos;s , right ?
you &apos;re right . i could .
so great .
but i won &apos;t .
i have a fairly specific rental agreement .
if they miss a payment , i &apos;m within my rights to evict .
oh , come on . why would you--
and quite honestly ,
it &apos;s gonna be a great relief
to be rid of such distasteful tenants .
you don &apos;t like nuns ?
who doesn &apos;t like nuns ?
oh , i have my reasons .
and they &apos;re mine .
let &apos;s just say i have a long and complicated history with them ,
and leave it at that .
hello ?
astrid .
mary margaret said i might find you down here .
i ... i made you a pie .
it &apos;s the least i could do after all your help .
wow .
oh , this boat is great !
it &apos;s gonna be amazing when you get it out on the water .
i can &apos;t even remember the last time i was on it .
wh @-@ what &apos;s this ?
if you sold all the candles ,
why are they still here , leroy ?
i didn &apos;t sell them all .
i tried to , but nobody wanted to buy them from me .
i was gonna tell you the truth ,
but i was afraid of letting you down .
so you lied .
i &apos;m sorry , astrid .
i guess you believed in the wrong guy .
you find something ?
kathryn &apos;s phone records .
every call she made the day she crashed her car ,
including an 8 @-@ minute call between her and david
within an hour of the accident .
that &apos;s not possible .
he said he didn &apos;t speak to her that day .
then he &apos;s lying .
no . i know when someone is lying , and david--
it &apos;s right here on paper , emma .
phone records don &apos;t lie . people do .
and our friend david does it better than most .
don &apos;t beat yourself up over this .
you &apos;re not the only person david fooled .
i &apos;ll have what she &apos;s having .
well ?
did you get it ?
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re right .
i was dreaming if i thought that the town harlot
and the town drunk could accomplish anything .
yeah .
just dreamin &apos; .
ahahem .
stealthy .
you know , if you wanted to sneak out , you should &apos;ve come to me .
you &apos;re leaving us ? without even saying good @-@ bye ?
but--but where you going ?
to be with nova .
we &apos;re in love . we &apos;re gonna see the world together .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought we were meant to live our lives here , in the mines .
i thought so , too ,
but things change when you fall in love .
suddenly anything seems possible .
well , take this with you .
it might come in handy .
i don &apos;t need it anymore .
you can &apos;t do this , dreamy .
you can &apos;t go to her .
why not ?
you have a responsibility--
to mine the diamonds we make into fairy dust .
but i love her .
you &apos;re a dwarf , dreamy .
we &apos;re not capable of love .
it &apos;s not how we &apos;re made .
what if i &apos;m different ?
what if you &apos;re wrong ?
bossy &apos;s not wrong , young one .
what you feel--
it &apos;s just a dream .
who are you ?
i &apos;m nova &apos;s teacher .
and if the two of you run away together , it will not end well .
nova will lose her wings .
but if you return to the mines
and if you allow nova
to become the fairy that she was meant to be ,
the two of you will bring untold joy to the world .
nova can be a great fairy ...
if you let her .
the choice is yours .
leroy ,
you understand that a relationship
between you and sister astrid can never happen .
yeah . yeah .
my whole life people made it their business
to tell me what i can &apos;t do .
she was the first person that said i could do anything ,
who believed in me .
i didn &apos;t want to disappoint her .
but there are consequences to following through
when the world tells you not to .
i mean , look at me .
i am a pariah in this town .
what about your good memories ?
what do you mean ?
didn &apos;t you have moments with him that you love ?
do you regret them ?
no , of course not .
isn &apos;t that what life &apos;s about ?
holding on to your good memories .
all i wanted was a moment with astrid--
one moment to give me hope that any dream &apos;s possible .
you &apos;ve had all that , mary margaret ,
so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it .
because i haven &apos;t .
well , if i had the dream ,
i m sorry to say it wasn &apos;t worth it .
and sitting here drinking won &apos;t end this pain .
what will ?
i can only think of one thing .
perfect .
leroy !
what are you doing ? !
please don &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m not gonna jump .
you &apos;re not ?
no . are you crazy ?
i could hit someone .
you know how much damage i could do ?
i &apos;m solidly built .
leroy , what are you doing up here ?
i &apos;m gonna get my moment .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what ?
you might wanna duck .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m selling candles , sister .
dreamy , come on . i have to show you something .
nova , we need to talk .
no . you have to see this .
take a look .
it &apos;s amazing .
it has everything we need to explore the world--
supplies , maps of all the kingdoms , a sturdy sail .
nova .
i can &apos;t go with you .
what about our life together ?
our dream ?
i &apos;m a dwarf , nova .
i belong in the mines .
you belong with the other fairies ,
and that &apos;s never gonna change .
dreamy .
you control what changes in your life .
never let yourself forget--
you &apos;re special .
why ?
what makes us different from any other dwarf or fairy out there ?
our love .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s love .
it &apos;s a dream . we need to put it away .
i don &apos;t want to put it away .
i &apos;m not your dream , nova .
your dream &apos;s to be a fairy godmother ,
and you can still be that .
you talked to the blue fairy .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
what did she say ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
what did she say ? !
nova !
what matters is ...
i can &apos;t stand in the way of your happiness .
but you &apos;re my happiness .
i love you .
don &apos;t you love me ?
i &apos;m a dwarf .
i can &apos;t love .
let &apos;s pick up the pace , boys !
we &apos;re making magic here !
where &apos;s my ax ?
where &apos;s my ax ?
dreamy , you &apos;re ...
back !
well , heigh @-@ ho , boys !
good to have you back , dreamy .
no place i &apos;d rather be .
heigh @-@ ho .
bossy .
hand me another ax .
here you are , dreamy .
it &apos;s &quot; grumpy &quot; now .
here you go .
leroy .
we sold out .
well , go on .
give her the news .
have your moment .
excuse me .
okay .
5,000 bucks .
piece of cake .
you sold them all ?
i had a little help .
you made it happen .
you have no idea .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you &apos;re welcome .
listen , that boat of mine ?
i &apos;m gonna fix it up .
and , well ,
maybe you could be my first passenger .
i &apos;d like that .
well , then that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do , sister .
oh . it &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
if this is about the blackout ,
i &apos;ve got the guys from the power company
down there working on it .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s been 24 hours
since my friend kathryn went missing .
have you found anything ?
i found something . i just don &apos;t know what it means .
well , what is it ?
at this point in the investigation ,
it &apos;s best i don &apos;t divulge that information .
if you &apos;re covering for someone ,
if you &apos;re not doing your job , sheriff swan ,
i &apos;ll find someone who will .
emma .
david , we need to talk .
did you get ahold of kathryn ?
no , i &apos;m afraid not .
then what is it ?
i need you to come to the sheriff &apos;s station with me
and tell me everything .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought i already did .
so did i.
