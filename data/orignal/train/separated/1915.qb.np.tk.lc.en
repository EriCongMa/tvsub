&quot; man on the moon &quot;
every doctor has a dirty little secret--
we &apos;re all competitive science nerds .
in grade school ...
we made the biggest and best volcanoes ,
which erupted actual fake molten laval .
in junior high ,
we spent hours laboring over our rat mazes ...
the computer diagnostic is complete . everything checks out .
finished the robotic prosthetic inspection .
it &apos;s all in order .
so ... we &apos;re ready to try again ?
let &apos;s get her connected .
okay .
okay .
every time you do that ...
i feel like the bride of frankenstein .
so that one day ...
we &apos;d be the person who changed the face of medicine ....
forever .
this is so exciting .
your first printed portal vein is going into a test subject .
how do you feel ?
like a farmhand behind the back barn .
here . why don &apos;t you take over the clippers ?
look at us .
changing the face of medicine , shearing a sheep .
no , i was shearing a sheep .
you are just giving him a fade .
there you go . there you go .
look at us . we &apos;re changing the face of medicine .
wow . that was ...
you really know what you &apos;re doing .
are you grading me ?
maybe i am , a little .
you &apos;re gettin &apos; an &quot; a. &quot;
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m kind of an overachiever .
i &apos;d like to go for the &quot; a &quot; -plus .
no . we have a ton to do before the procedure today .
okay .
the conduit &apos;s coming off the printer in ...
two hours , 47 minutes--
which gives us another 30 minutes
before we have to start prep .
all right .
maybe a little extra credit ?
how &apos;s your research going ?
oh , the diagnostics look good .
i just slipped out for a sec .
i don &apos;t want to miss this .
do you think you &apos;re gonna make it to the shower ?
oh , crap . kepner &apos;s shower is today ?
yeah , it &apos;s today .
and she &apos;s our friend , so ...
i know she &apos;s our friend .
you don &apos;t have to tell me she &apos;s our friend .
sorry .
well ... i just--i &apos;ll be there if i can .
great .
great .
dr. robbins . dr. torres
dr. murphy .

i do . me .
whoa . hey , wait . what about my surgery ?
here &apos;s plenty of room . it &apos;s just me and dr. grey ,
an anesthesiologist , and a veterinarian .
you lost me at &quot; veterinarian . &quot;
he &apos;s putting a seeded conduit into a baby .

i need all of you to step back , please . step back .

i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s not moving .
ah , he &apos;s not breathing .
911 said a rig &apos;s ten minutes out ,
but we gotta get an airway now .
i swear i didn &apos;t see it happen . it was an accident , all right ?

back up . back it up .
he &apos;s not breathing .
whoa ! jeez !
what the hell are you doing ? !
good chest rise . i think he &apos;s breathing .
i hope he knows what he &apos;s doing .
the cameras are only recording
the doctors and the surgical field .
your son &apos;s identity will be completely protected .
good morning .
big day .
we &apos;re just hearing about the cameras .
sorry ?
we just told the glaziers
we have a lot of people who &apos;d like to observe ,
so we &apos;ve set up a live stream .
okay , but i think we would feel better
if we knew the focus was on our baby , not putting on a show .
the cameras are there so that , in success ,
other doctors can learn this technique
to help other kids like nathan .
no . no , that doesn &apos;t work for me . he &apos;s a baby .
he &apos;s a baby .
ashley .
ashley , look at me .
i will be performing the operation ,
and my focus will be your son .
that is all i care about , okay ? that &apos;s it .
you spring this on me the day of surgery ?
what ?
this circus ?
ross said that this came from you .
everyone in the hospital &apos;s been asking to watch the procedure .
i got e @-@ mails from ucla and baylor .
they wanted a stream .
and i felt none of that should be on your plate ,
so i made some executive decisions .
i &apos;m happy to have you veto any of them .
yeah , like all of &apos; em .
if that &apos;s what dr. yang wants , consider it done .
ross , hang on .
this is a teaching hospital .
we need to create conditions
where more people can learn from what you &apos;re doing .
live streaming ? what if something goes wrong ?
even if something goes wrong ,
you &apos;re doing important work , and people should see that .
i need take this one .
cristina ?
fine .
okay , now we &apos;re gonna start small today .
just wiggle your fingers .
got it .
okay .
let me do it .
okay .
yeah , okay . how about just one finger ?
now just a finger ?
which one ?
your choice .
keep it clean , though .
and just try to relax .
i &apos;m pretty relaxed , john .
not gonna distract you .
i &apos;m just gonna go grab a bite .
do you want anything ?
i wanna move this stupid finger .
you can do it .
try again ?
whenever you &apos;re ready .
damn it !
you put the sensors in weeks ago .
i haven &apos;t moved the damn thing once .
you will .
just focus on wiggling the fingers .
okay ? just bend it from here--
i can &apos;t focus on anything with you talking at me .
okay , hang a bana bag and give him 2 of ativan .
i &apos;ve treated him before .
he &apos;s a heroin addict .
okay , let &apos;s , uh , start a tox screen
and start him on methadone .
no .
no methadone .
the methadone will help you detox .
i haven &apos;t used in months .
i gotta get totally clean . off the methadone , too .
i gotta do it .
let me do it .
okay , then . no methadone .
let &apos;s admit him and watch him .
can we send him to a rehab facility ?
he &apos;s--he &apos;s alex &apos;s dad .
there &apos;s history . like , bad history .
i don &apos;t care who he is .
for you , he is a patient who had heart surgery
less than three months ago .
and you are his doctor , so act like it .
get him admitted .
oh , uh , dr. hunt ?
hey , i did it .
um , i did two days with her following me around
everywhere i go .
i don &apos;t need help anymore . i &apos;m doing really well .
you &apos;re pulling your fingers again .
oh , god . go away .
uh , look , i @-@ i just wanna be cleared for surgery .
dr. alma , is she clear for surgery ?
no , she &apos;s not .
hmm . dr. bailey , you &apos;re not clear until she says you &apos;re clear .
okay .
we need to fast track this
because , uh , i have patients trying to schedule surgeries .
so ...
just--just tell me what hoop i need to jump through
for you to clear me .
and this is the er , where i spend most of my time .
i kind of run it .
ah , hey . who &apos;s this ?
these are my sisters .
hi , i &apos;m arizona robbins . it &apos;s--
arizona !
i feel like i know you .
april told us everything about you .
are you gonna make it to the shower ?
we throw the best showers .
i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
i have a cat a home who lost a leg .
every time i see him hopping around ,
i just think , that is real strength .
stop talking .
well , it was super nice to meet you guys .
and i will see you at the shower .
she is such a good walker .
okay , um , i &apos;m just gonna get dressed .
and then we &apos;ll head out . okay ?
coming through !
32 @-@ year @-@ old male . we just lost his airway .
i &apos;m gonna change it over a wire .
we need a 5 millimeter shiley
and a percutaneous trach kit right away .
let &apos;s get him set up for transfer .
by my count , one , two , three .
all right , let &apos;s go . betadine the neck .
he couldn &apos;t breathe so i trached him .
you trached him ?
oh , yeah , he did .
took out his little boy scout knife
and sliced a wide and horizontal incision into his throat ,
way lower than it needed to be--
all things i &apos;m gonna need to fix in surgery .
ready ?
mother of ...
sick .
you guys cannot be in here .
damn it . all right , let the o.r. know that
we gotta come up there and fix your mess .
hey , i had to do it like that .
and when you take a closer look , you &apos;re gonna see that .
it doesn &apos;t matter right now .
what matters is we have to get him ready for transfer .
so can you just take my sisters and go now ?
alex , i have to tell you something that you &apos;re not gonna wanna hear .
well , then don &apos;t tell me .
your dad &apos;s here . jimmy &apos;s here .
what ? why ?
he &apos;s going through withdrawal .
kick him out .
i can &apos;t .
i can .
alex ...
get up .
hey , son .
how you doin &apos; ?
you &apos;re not staying here .
we &apos;ve helped you once .
we &apos;re not helping you with this .
alex--
son , listen--
oh , stop calling me that .
i know who you are .
i didn &apos;t remember--
i don &apos;t care .
i didn &apos;t remember till i saw you pissed off ,
till i saw you standing over me .
like when you were 15 , you said you wished i was dead .
i &apos;ve been trying to get right since the bar .
i &apos;m still trying .
not here .
no , alex , stop .
i &apos;m not gonna help a guy who made my life hell .
no , you &apos;re not .
but i am because he needs help and i &apos;m a doctor .
you can go .
i got this . really , it &apos;s okay .
so it &apos;s not the sensors . is it the coding ?
coding &apos;s been tested and retested .
so it &apos;s becca .
it &apos;s becca .
look , she is not the most positive person ,
i mean , every day it &apos;s a fight .
but she &apos;s trying .
she &apos;s no ray of sunshine , but she &apos;s trying .
uh , maybe it &apos;s me . maybe it &apos;s not becca .
maybe i &apos;m just not saying the right thing to get her to do it .
it may surprise you to learn that i am quite good at sutures .
it wouldn &apos;t surprise me in the least .
what would surprise me is if you were able to do
five of them without engaging in o.c.d. behaviors .
and if i can ,
you &apos;ll sign off so i can go back to work ?
that &apos;s the deal .
five sutures .
that &apos;s all ?
that &apos;s all .
game on .
uh , just a sec .
now ... only use the tools to your immediate right .
if you touch any of the trays , we start over .
if you count your fingers , if you double @-@ check a stitch ,
if you rearrange any of the instruments on the trays ,
we start over .
five sutures . whenever you &apos;re ready .
i can &apos;t believe you yelled at matthew in front of my sisters .
now they &apos;re gonna think i &apos;m engaged to a nitwit .
all right , duckie--
don &apos;t call me duckie !
okay .
it means &quot; ugly duckling &quot;
because i grew up with braces and pimples ,
and they still see me that way .
it &apos;s like idiot incapable of doing anything right .
i &apos;m a freaking trauma surgeon !
he did a great job .
actually , i would &apos;ve done exactly the same thing .
matthew was right ?
yep .
you should go spread the word .
you are not engaged to a nitwit .
you know what , this is actually gonna be a pretty easy fix .
so why don &apos;t you just go ahead and go ? i got it .
really ? i was kinda hopin &apos; that i could hide out here all day .
they came all this way to see you .
you should go .
smile .
edwards , can we stop fiddling with the camera ?
and let &apos;s get started .
getting proximal vascular control .
she said she &apos;s getting proximal vascular control .
you &apos;re changing the face of medicine .
you need to be louder .
do you know who doesn &apos;t talk about changing the face of medicine ?
people who change the face of medicine .
they just do their job .
okay , preparing to place the portal vein .
doctor ...
dr. yang , surgeons at baylor have joined us .
okay , at this point ,
i have dissected the scar tissue
and put the patient on bypass .
timing is everything .
we just received word that
the conduit has gone through its final round of tests ,
and is on its way to the o.r.
while we wait ,
dr. karev can give a brief patient history .
9 @-@ month @-@ old born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome .
he &apos;s rejected the synthetic conduit that was previously placed .
this conduit was granted by f.d.a. with compassionate use .
this is dr. ross .
and this is the conduit
we printed on the 3d printer .
all right . okay , let &apos;s commence with the implantation process .
declamping the portal vein .
oh ! we have blood flow !
okay , let &apos;s recheck vitals .
oh , uh , blood pressure &apos;s 115 over 75 .
blood pressure &apos;s falling .
you know , the conduit is a little smaller than anticipated .
i &apos;m gonna do a triangular cut with a patch .
call the lab and try to ...
global testing .
excuse me .
did she move her hand ?
no .
oh , that sucks .
yes .
well , it &apos;s just--it just takes time , right ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , cheer up .
why ?
my research just stalled . why would i cheer up ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know , that &apos;s just something that people say--
i know , i know . i &apos;m just ...
let &apos;s not fight .
callie .
i-- i should get back .
all of our preliminary research , however ...
wow . did you see that ?
yeah , that was intense .
do you think they &apos;re gonna break up ?
c.v.p. is low , he doesn &apos;t have enough volume .
okay , uh , give another , uh , bolus of l.r.
you &apos;re gonna fluid overload him .
what &apos;s that piece sticking up on the conduit ?
is there a gap in the anastomosis ?
dr. yang ?
say something .
for posterity .
uh , this is dr. meredith grey .
today , we implanted a 3d printed portal vein
with seeded cells into a sheep .
currently , her vitals are stable ,
and dr. edwards will continue to monitor her via ultrasound .
our hope is that
the portal vein will continue to heal , without stenosis .
he &apos;s in v @-@ fib .
damn it . starting c.p.r.
internal paddles .
okay .
charge to 10 .
turn the camera off .
clear .
ross , get the camera off .
stop filming .
we &apos;ve sat outside all night long waiting to hold him ,
and now you &apos;re telling us that we have to wait longer ?
nathan &apos;s numbers still aren &apos;t stable enough for--
we should &apos;ve never let you talk us into this .
we should &apos;ve gone with the synthetic graft .
we should &apos;ve listened to you .
it &apos;s still early .
the conduit could still be a success .
do you believe that ?
look me in the eye and tell me you believe that .
let &apos;s focus on what we know .
right now , he &apos;s on the oscillator
to force oxygen into his lungs ,
and if he can maintain his sats ,
we hope to be able to get him on a normal ventilator .
one step at a time .
okay ?
nurses &apos; station .
thanks for the strong show of support .
sorry , i &apos;ve got ...
i got a lot on my mind .
alex ...
yeah , it &apos;s just been a crap couple of days .
alex ...
do you really think the conduit &apos;s gonna be a success ?
i don &apos;t know . i hope so .
do you want another blanket ?
where &apos;s alex ?
alex , come here !
i &apos;m here .
who broke this ?
where &apos;s he at ?
jimmy , alex isn &apos;t coming back .
just tell me what you need .
helen , you let the damn kid do whatever he wants .
i told him not to play with my stuff .
now look at this !
where-- alex ! look at this !
jimmy . jimmy .
it &apos;s dr. wilson ,
you &apos;re detoxing , which causes hallucinations .
ah , oh , god . don &apos;t start that crap with me right now .
helen ...
i swear to god . i ...
alex .
okay . okay .
okay .
okay , shh .
dr. ross , how &apos;s it going ?
don &apos;t be smug .
what ?
you won , we lost . i get it .
dr. ross , you do not get to talk to me that way .
congratulations .
dr. ross , get back here !
nurses &apos; station . please hold .
where &apos;s april ?
oh ! um , a trauma came in .
she got pulled into surgery .
you know , i don &apos;t know how long she &apos;ll be .
so , what ? we just cancel the shower ?
we already paid for the flowers , the food , the champagne .
when she came in this morning to work ,
she promised she &apos;d be done on time .
yeah , we say a lot of things .
look , we &apos;re just not in charge of our schedule .
this is just how it works .
why do you live this way ?
because we save people &apos;s lives .
she &apos;ll pop in at some point .
no , it &apos;s her shower . she can &apos;t just pop .
you may have to settle for a pop .
done .
see ? two down , three to go .
i thought that a good night &apos;s sleep
was gonna make it easier .
you know what will make it easier .
miranda , i hate to see you suffer like this .
take the medication .
two down .
three to go .
okay , okay , um ,
why don &apos;t we take a five minute break ?
i &apos;m gonna go visit the ladies &apos; room .
just for reference .
oh , come--
i &apos;ll be back .
sir , what are you doing here ?
well , if i was gonna come back to work ,
i need to practice my skills .
but you are jeopardizing your recovery .
you should be home , not--
sitting on the couch , flipping through the channels
isn &apos;t gonna get me back to work in an o.r. any faster .
i mean , i &apos;m sitting there watching housewives flip tables
and celebs flip houses .
and pretty soon , it &apos;s just like
i could feel my brain cells wither and die .
bailey , these trays are a mess .
i don &apos;t know how you expect to find anything on &apos; em .
okay , now visualize the ligaments
in your right index finger contracting .
stupid , stupid , stupid .
hey , babe . they got those chips you like .
john , leave us alone .
i &apos;m sorry .
just wait outside ,
and i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m done .
just go .
my god .
did you see that ?
i just keep snapping at him .
and pretty soon , we can &apos;t even look at each other .
it &apos;s awful .
i &apos;m awful .
because ...
he does everything for me .
and i started this because i wanted to do something
for him for once .
and it seemed like something i could do .
i just wanted to do ... one damn thing .
and i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m done .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
okay . let &apos;s take a break .
no , you &apos;re not hearing me .
i don &apos;t wanna do this anymore .
i can &apos;t .
i hate this .
take this crap out of my head .
do you wanna schedule surgery to have them taken out ?
dr. torres , we are not there yet .
well , if she doesn &apos;t wanna keep--
dr. torres , may i talk with you ?
yeah .
excuse us .
no , no , no , no , no , no ! no .
she distended . she dropped pressure and flatlined .
she &apos;s been down for 20 minutes , dr. edwards .
it &apos;s over .
so sorry , little girl .
we tried .
edwards , do you know how many dogs the russians sent into space
before a man walked on the moon ?
those poor puppies .
edwards , we are going to do a necropsy ,
and we are going to find out what went wrong .
and then we &apos;ll try again , and we &apos;ll fail again ,
because that &apos;s what progress looks like .
progress looks like a dead sheep .
no , progress looks like a bunch of failures .
and you &apos;re gonna have feelings about that
because it &apos;s sad , but you can &apos;t fall apart .
and then one day , we will succeed ,
and we will save a person &apos;s life .
and we will walk on the moon .
figuratively , anyway .
are you with me ?
she hates being here .
she shows up every day . she is trying .
no , i can &apos;t fight anymore . every day---
every day is a fight . my whole world is a fight .
at home , i fight with arizona ,
and then i come here and fight with becca ,
and now i &apos;m fighting with you .
well , we just haven &apos;t figured it out yet ...
how to get her to do it .
so we &apos;re frustrated , and she &apos;s frustrated .
is it wrong that i wish
that water were a bottle of gin ?
is that gonna be for me or ...
we need to talk to becca .
it is so great that you two are trying to work things out .
it is so much better for the kids .
duckie doesn &apos;t know this , but my husband had an affair .
oh , that &apos;s ...
we have , uh , three boys , so we stayed together .
wow , so , did you go to therapy ?
because we can &apos;t even agree on that .
oh , no .
we didn &apos;t feel the need to talk it to death .
we just focused on moving forward ,
putting it in the past .
hoping things would get better one day .
so , well , did that work ?
well ... we are still getting through it .
and we &apos;re back to two .
let &apos;s try for a third .
no , no , this is the seventh .
two stitches ago , you tugged on your fingers .
two before that ,
you straightened an instrument on the tray .
look , i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t keep doing this .
i can &apos;t--
i know .
then you really need to consider
taking the medication .
okay , no , i &apos;m not taking the damn pills !
bailey , i was gonna head up to kepner &apos;s shower
to steal some food . come with me .
you just need a break .
n @-@ n--i need ...
to get back into surgery .
i heard nathan &apos;s not doing so well .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , i &apos;m trying to figure out
if there &apos;s a plan &quot; b &quot; we can try .
but i don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s gonna ...
i heard your sheep did great . congrats .
thanks . actually , the sheep died .
oh , sorry .
did you need the printer ?
yeah , but if you ne it more ...
no , i &apos;ll finish this up , and then it &apos;s all yours .
so can i ask you a question ,
um , about ross ?
yeah , what about him ?
he seems different .
do you notice that ?
well , no , not really .
well , he &apos;s not the same guy he was when he started here .
he &apos;s not the guy who delivered my baby .
yeah , well , we &apos;re not the same as when we were interns either .
well , i understand that .
but he is aggressive and mean .
i don &apos;t know , i mean ,
he spends a lot of time on your service .
do you think he &apos;s trying to be like you ?
or ... do you notice that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
are you saying i taught him to be mean ?
that &apos;s what he &apos;s learned from me ?
no .
because a little edge is not the worst thing for a surgeon .
i understand that .
and i am not mean .
i am effective .
are you implying that i &apos;m not ?
well , no , you just said i ruined a resident .
no , that is not what i said .
i said something is off about ross .
well , maybe he got tired of people thinking
he was soft around the edges .
maybe his focus is being a doctor ,
and not a flight attendant .
and my job is his surgical skill ,
not his personality .
talk to me , ross . what &apos;s going on ?
nathan &apos;s o @-@ 2 sats are stable , so ...
dr.ross says that &apos;s a good sign .
it &apos;s an excellent sign .
he can come off the oscillator .
it &apos;s working ?
i think so .
yes !
helen !
jimmy .
where are the car keys ?
you didn &apos;t get alex .
jimmy , it &apos;s all right . let &apos;s just take you--
he &apos;s--he &apos;s still out there waiting .
you said you &apos;d get him . i come home ,
you &apos;re just sitting on the bedroom floor !
alex is all right , jimmy . li--
it &apos;s after dark ! he could be anywhere !
you stupid--

she was supposed to get you . i was afraid you--
just shut up !
alex , please ! alex , don &apos;t !
go sleep it off !
come on .
go get some sleep .
you okay ?
i &apos;m sorry .
why are you sorry ? he &apos;s a junkie .
she was crazy .
i started running interference for them when i was 6 .
it &apos;s like riding a bike .
i &apos;m just asking for one more time .
last time , i swear .
if you wanna go , we can just--
john , hush .
fine , you wanna waste your time ?
i don &apos;t care .
all right . i &apos;ll be outside .
actually , john , we need you here .
you &apos;re gonna stand right here , okay ?
okay .
when you &apos;re thirsty ,
you don &apos;t think about moving your fingers ,
or grasping the cup .
you just get a drink ,
and the rest follows .
becca , i want you to look at john .
hi .
when do i move the hand ?
you don &apos;t .
just look at john .
think about what you want to say to him .
you don &apos;t have to say it .
just think about it .
did it just ...
look at john .
what do you want to say to him ?
becca ...
becca , you touched me .
i never thought you &apos;d do that again .
me neither .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
oh ! you are gonna love that thing .
i use mine all the time .
great !
it &apos;s a salad spinner .
i don &apos;t know what it does .
but the guy at the store recommended it and ...
the receipt is on the back .
thank you , mer .
ooh , another bow .
who &apos;s making the ribbon bouquet ?
ooh , hey , yay .
so she can carry it at the rehearsal .
super fun .
ooh , we are late .
do you think she noticed that we &apos;re late ?
i don &apos;t even think she knows we &apos;re invited .
what did we miss ?
um , garlic press , coffee maker ,
and a delicious tray of bruschetta .
oh , beautiful !
did you even see what she got ?
it doesn &apos;t matter ,
as long as you say something nice .
you gotta try the quiche .
lovely !
love it .
fantastic !
okay , um , you know what ? this one is from your sisters .
oh , no , not that one .
we wanted to save that one , duckie , to open in private .
oh , my god . you guys , you--you actually remembered ?
you remembered
how much i wanna wear mom &apos;s veil ?
no , we didn &apos;t--
grab it , alice !
i &apos;m trying , stop !
oh . this isn &apos;t mom &apos;s veil .
adorable !
delightful !
it &apos;s not .
we are sorry .
that was supposed to be for later .
but since you &apos;ve opened it ... surprise !
it &apos;s for your wedding night ,
for when you and mathew ...
oh , god .
there &apos;s no reason to be embarrassed .
we all had our first times , too , right , ladies ?
we wanted to give you the lingerie and some tips .
the pearls , by the way ,
are for the inside--
stop . just stop talking .
but mathew is your first real boyfriend .
we &apos;re trying to help .
please , don &apos;t .
and he &apos;s a great catch .
and you don &apos;t have the best track record with men .
no , she doesn &apos;t have any track record .
when i found out you had a boyfriend , i was like ,
&quot; don &apos;t make any sudden movements . &quot;
oh , my god , stop talking to me
like no man has ever found me sexy .
duckie--
and stop ... calling me ... duckie !
i &apos;m not duckie anymore .
my acne cleared up years ago .
i got rid of my braces in college .
i @-@ i wear contacts . i use makeup .
i did years of physical therapy to correct my pigeon toes ,
and in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;ve learned how to condition my hair .
i &apos;m not your ...
hopeless , ugly little sister anymore .
i am not an ugly duckling .
i &apos;m a swan .
and a surgeon--a freaking kick ass surgeon--
who , by the way , has had sex before .
oh , my .
does daddy know ?
you know what ?
you &apos;re fired as my bridesmaids ,
all three of you .
i don &apos;t want a single one of you
standing up for me at my wedding .
honey , don &apos;t be silly . you have to have bridesmaids .
and i will .
these are my people now .
right ?
right .
yes .
these are my bridesmaids .
you owe me an apology .
april said you would &apos;ve done exactly what i did .
yeah . yeah , i told april that .
but the truth is
that you messed up this guy &apos;s neck ,
and i spent eight hours fixing it yesterday .
so how &apos; bout &quot; thank you &quot; ?
how &apos; bout you should &apos;ve waited one second for the surgeon
standing right next you ? i mean , what was that ?
you felt like you had to be the big man out there ?
i mean , you feel threatened by me or ...
no , i don &apos;t feel threatened by you .
i was trying to save the guy &apos;s life .
great . so was i.
okay , i don &apos;t have a problem with you .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have a problem with you either , man .
hope to see you at the wedding .
yeah , i , uh , actually don &apos;t know
if i &apos;m gonna be able to make it .
well , i know it would mean a lot to april if you could .
since we &apos;re good ,
you should definitely come .
before my accident , you called me a drunk .
i am so sorry .
there has not been a day since
that i haven &apos;t regretted--
you &apos;re right .
i am a drunk .
sir ...
i &apos;m an alcoholic ,
which is why i &apos;m here now instead of home .
it &apos;s boring there , and lonely .
and when i &apos;m bored and lonely ,
i wanna have a drink .
hell , i wanted to have a drink when i &apos;m happy , too .
i always want a drink ,
because i have a disease ,
and it can &apos;t be cured .
but it can be managed .
but i can &apos;t do it by myself .
i need help .
accept that you have a disease , bailey .
accept help .
we &apos;re all here for you
when you &apos;re ready to get started .
sometimes , the key to making progress
is to recognize how to take that very first step .
then you start your journey .
that is not what i said , at all .
yeah , well , it &apos;s not what you said .
it &apos;s how you said it . that tone that you--
oh , okay , so now we &apos;re gonna fight about how we fight ?
this is-- i am sick of this !
i mean , every time we talk it--it turns into this--this--
okay , i &apos;m sorry ,
do you think that i &apos;m not sick of it , callie ?
&apos;cause everything i say seems to piss you off !
like everything &apos;s loaded and i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s--
i think talking may be the problem .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t ... talk as much .
you hope for the best .
and you stick with it ,
day in ,
day out .
even if you &apos;re tired ,
even if you wanna walk away ,
you don &apos;t .
because you are a pioneer .
alex , aaron , get your asses in the car ...
before i give you something to cry about .
but nobody ever said
