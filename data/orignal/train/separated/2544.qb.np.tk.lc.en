krusty the clown learns what it &apos;s like to work for himself .
pass .
there comes a time in everyone &apos;s life
when you need a little extra help
getting up from your chair .
that &apos;s why we invented the seat @-@ to @-@ feet lift chair ,
which makes getting up by yourself ...
a thing of the past ?
a thing of the past !
wha ... ? he &apos;s ... he &apos;s up !
he &apos;s up .
eleventy @-@ hundred ?
i can &apos;t afford that .
but that chair would be a lot better
than the way i get up now .

i &apos;m harper . just moved here .
trying to make friends .

trying to make friends .
well , i &apos;ve got news for all of your clubs :
at 3 p.m. , so willie &apos;s turnin &apos; on the sprinklers !
guys ,
i need your advice .
season three of anything is the best .
agreed .
but i wanted advice for something else .
it &apos;s something i really need for my well @-@ being ,
but i just don &apos;t have the bucks .
the thing everyone &apos;s doing these days ,
by which i mean a couple of years ago ,
is to get money through crowdfunding .
you thought about that ?
yes , but what is it ?
crowdfunding is when lots of people
give you small amounts of money
to help your passion project come to life .
thanks to crowdfunding , we have makey makey computers ,
the 3doodler pen ,
and zach braff &apos;s generation @-@ defining dud
&quot; wish i was here . &quot;
well , if there &apos;s anything
that has true wisdom , it &apos;s crowds .
hello , friends .
are you sick of &quot; big charity &quot; asking you for money ,
with its free return envelopes
and annoying black tie dinners ?
well , i &apos;m here to ask you
for something different .
something simple .
you can help a man get back on his feet .
dad , what are you recording ?
ooh , lisa .
turn to camera and quickly say &quot; please give . &quot;
please give .
give what ?
uh , lisa ... eh , well , we &apos;ll fix that in post .
he didn &apos;t even have the money to fix that in post .
that is the saddest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
well , i suppose i could spare a little
for my neighboreeno .
will you shut up , flanders ? !
lip zipped .
i don &apos;t give handouts
to poor people .
it &apos;s not in the spirit of self @-@ made americanism ,
as espoused by russian weirdo ayn rand .
dang it !
we did it , friends .
made our goal .
and now , to reveal the miracle
that you all made happen ...
that &apos;s right .
you bought me this chair .
my ass was just lifted
by a thousand angels .
we bought him a chair ?
that lazy lump !
after i finish this beer and have a nap ,
i may just call him .
you gave money to this idiot ?
it was from my separate bank account .
what separate account ?
i only use it to pay for my separate phone .
you have a separate phone ?
up , down ,
up , down .
up , down ...
up , down .
good !
you feel the burning in your core ?
oh , yes , i do .
homie , answer the door !
for the first time in my life ,
i &apos;d be happy to !
spend my money on a chair , sir ?
you &apos;re a lazy , bald monster .
don &apos;t be alarmed , there , homer .
we &apos;re just gonna calmly and gently
destroy that chair !
no way .
my chair is now protected by a human shield .
take that , you idiot !
lisa ...
the crowdfunding video you costarred in
is causing a lot of problems .
the what @-@ what i what @-@ whatted in ?
burn that chair !
burn that chair !
burn that chair !
wait a minute .
that &apos;s not the chair .
no tip !
guess a guy like me
is never gonna get the finer things in life .
what &apos;s the point ?
aw , you poor thing .
i &apos;ve never seen you this unhappy lying down .
dad ?
can you take me to a concert with my new friend harper ?
her dad got us the seats .
sure , why not ?
it &apos;ll be nosebleed or obstructed view seats .
that &apos;s all a self @-@ pitying guy like me ever gets .
who &apos;s the band ?
they &apos;re an adorable australian boy band ,
and you can &apos;t really understand what they &apos;re saying .
but who cares ?
i understand .
that &apos;s how i felt about crocodile dundee .
i will never forgive you
for making us see that third movie .
music in a sports arena .
the acoustics are gonna be a joke .
two tickets for homer simpson .
here you go ...
and here are your platinum v.i.p. wristbands .
what the ... ? v.i.p. ?
oh , this is never coming off !
just like the one
from the last great day in my life .
oh , those muffins .
and it &apos;s all thanks to harper &apos;s dad .
who is this guy ?
mi hijo queria ver esto ,
pero no puedo arrastrarla a mi show .
yes , yes , yes .
the only platinum band i have
is the one that &apos;s holding my skull together .
um , through that door .
remember when we were a @-@ list ?
it all went south for me when i got that d.u.i.
and said all those things i secretly believe .
doe @-@ eyed boys !
where ? where ?
maybe one of these four little wimps will tell me .
answer me , wimps !
that &apos;s them .
the band .
hi . i &apos;m bindi ,
and this is boz , mcquarrie and wodonga .
wodonga .
i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t belong here .
your wristbands are platinum with stripes .
you belong ...

oh , my god !
oh , i wish i could tell you guys
what &apos;s in there , but you know ...
no stripes .
lisa ! you made it !

and i am so stoked to meet you !

uh , listen , sweetie .
let me tell you a fact of life .
the world is full of wonderful , priceless experiences ,
and i can &apos;t give you any of them .

marge , do you know what it &apos;s like
to have a man take care of your every need ?
i &apos;ve thought about it a lot , but no .
how come you &apos;re so quiet ?
did he switch your brain with a rabbit &apos;s ?
&apos;cause that means somewhere there is one annoying rabbit .
shut up .
i just keep thinking about the way harper cut me off .
it &apos;s kind of weird .
yeah , that was kind of weird .
i &apos;d have said something for sure ,
but my mouth was full of truffle popcorn .
mike just invited our family

it just wouldn &apos;t be right for me to accept it .
you &apos;d rather have your crappy bike ?
look , harper , this may be crappy ,
but it &apos;s my bike .
my dad assembled it on christmas day .
which is why i have to pedal backwards to go forwards .
but still , i love this !
uh , i didn &apos;t realize getting you the best bike
you ever saw would make you so mad .
i &apos;m not mad , i just think this is ...
just what ?
don &apos;t appreciate what i did for you ?
why do you always interrupt me like that ?
that &apos;s not how friends ...
uh , i think i know how friends are .

i &apos;ll be the coolest kid ever .
oh ! too fast !
you can put that stuff away , &apos; cause the trip is off .

nowhere , &apos; cause we &apos;re not friends anymore .
you owe me a caribbean vacation , lisa !
st. croix or better .
lisa , sweetie , i just want to understand .
you got in a fight with her
because she tried to give you a new bike ? !
but she was so condescending !
yeah , she was &quot; kinda sending &quot; you a new bike .
can you all please get out of my room ?
let &apos;s not let our little girls&apos;
not liking each other
stand in the way of their being friends .
come to the island , man .
we have everything there ,
except for trunks your size-- ha !
you still want us to come ?
oh , kids fight all the time .
they &apos;re not in control of themselves like we are .
damn , that is a beautiful sunset !
damn ! damn ! aah !

and the only problem will be the sand in our whatevers .

homer , help me out here .
no , no , with the girls .
just tell your kid to let my kid have her way this time .
and every other time .
dad ...
i think you have a choice to make here .
it &apos;s time i stood up for myself .
harper , i know i shouldn &apos;t say this on your private island ,
but you &apos;re kind of spoiled .
that &apos;s right .
you don &apos;t deserve lisa .
there &apos;s nothing i love more than her .
she &apos;s the sun , the moon and the other thing to me .
thank you .
and we don &apos;t have to be on the same island
with people who push my little girl around .
let &apos;s go , marge .
now ? i just got up .
now , please !
if you leave this island ,
you &apos;re not taking the yacht .
oh , no .
you &apos;re taking a limo to the private jet ,
which is flying you straight home .
then so be it .
i know how you feel , buddy .
oh , i better sit down . where can i sit ?
dad , what you said was really nice .
and believe me , we are much better off
off that island .
