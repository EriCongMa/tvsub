"You Got to Hide Your Love Away"
Cancer is a biological bully,
always picking a fight,
and it'll sneak up on you.
Can we just stay in bed all day?
I could be into that.
You are not making this any easier.
Okay, okay, 15 minutes.
I have 15 minutes
until I absolutely have to get up and get going.
All right, well, then let's make
the most of the next 15 minutes!
It'll wait until the body feels safe,
until it feels healthy and strong...
I can't believe I'm dating a man who lives in a tin can.
A tin can on wheels.
You ever think of moving to a place that can't roll away?
I...haven't given it much thought.
Not that I don't love the trailer
and the roughing it in nature.
It's like camping.
Mmm. Wait. Wait. You hate camping.
I hate camping. I do.
Well, maybe we should look at getting
a bigger place... together.
I thought you hadn't given it much thought.
I just did. I'm a fast thinker.
What do you think?
I think that's a good idea.
I'm a fast thinker, too.
that's when cancer will move on in
and get bigger and bigger.
What do you think -- the blue or the, uh, burgundy?
The blue makes you look too handsome.
You don't want the president to be distracted
by those piercing blue eyes.
Oh, you want me to get the job.
I want neurosurgeon Dr. Shepherd to get the job.
I don't want my husband Dr. Shepherd to get the job.
That's complicated.
Yes, well, I'm complicated.
I'm gonna take a shower now.
So am I.
No.
It's been three weeks.
You went back on your promise.
I can't sleep with a man who's a lying liar.
What if I put on the blue tie?
Nope.
You're having fun. You delight in my pain.
I just took off my robe.
Now I'm soaping myself up.
Oh, my goodness.
The body never even sees it coming...
Callie, come on. We got to go.
Well, we said we'd each do a box a day.
I'm doing mine, so come do yours.
No, no, no. Sophia's ready to go.
Come on -- it'll just take a minute.
Callie -- - unpack this box!
You know, the whole world is not going to end
if I don't open this box --
Open it.
...because cancer is the master of surprises.
I inscribed the band
with the date we moved into this house.
Our new start.
Calliope Iphegenia Torres --
Put it on!
Take it off!
Take it off! Your ring.
Take off your ring.
Thank you, Dr. Avery.
I am, um -- I'm glad you agree
that a microvascular free flap is called for in this...
...particular sc-- scenario.
Yeah.
Well, you are not getting your security deposit back.
Glad I never gave you one.
You guys are really serious.
Yes, we are.
What did I miss?
Owen and Emma are moving in together.
He holds a meeting for that?
Thank you all for coming.
I know you're all busy, so this won't take long.
The board has just approved a new non-fraternization policy.
This hospital has to be a safe work environment
where our focus remains clearly on providing
the best patient care possible.
Moving forward,
all relationships with co-workers
will be discouraged.
And all relationships between superiors and subordinates
is strictly prohibited.
You will all receive a copy of the new rules.
Your supervisors will arrange meetings to go over the details.
And that's it. Let's get back to work.
So, um, you're the panty police now?
I know there will be some feelings,
and I know you've established
good relationships with the residents,
so I'd like you to take them today
and make sure that they understand the policy.
So you want me to be the panty police.
All due respect, nuts to that.
Dr. Hunt, we have some questions about the policy.
Dr. Webber can answer all of your questions.
Hey, Rory. How you doing?
Besides the fact that I have bone cancer, I'm great.
Seriously. Look at this polish.
It's called "Bad to the bone."
We saw it at the drugstore,
and it was like god ordered us to buy it.
Hey, I don't take any orders from any god
who gives me cancer twice.
Dude, your stupid brain cancer got us a puppy,
and your stupid bone cancer
is getting us both out of finals.
You're right.
Yay, god.
Take a deep breath.
All right, so, today's gonna be a piece of cake.
We're gonna stage the tumor, do a biopsy,
and then we'll come up with a treatment plan.
This isn't a brain tumor coming back?
I mean, it was six years ago, but --
No, I looked at Dr. Shepherd's notes
and his follow-up scans,
and I really think that you beat that.
I think this is a totally separate cancer.
Are you having any trouble breathing?
No.
She has decreased breath sounds.
Let's add a contrast study to that staging C.T.
Why? What do you think it is?
Uh, the contrast just gives us more of a detailed look.
Um, yeah, you know, and it'll give your toes
a chance to dry before the biopsy.
Perfect. Yeah.
Coming through.
What do we got?
Lisa Campbell, 32,
found in apartment trash chute.
Compactor tore her leg up pretty good before it jammed.
Lost a lot of blood in the field,
but vitals are stable.
Why was she in a trash --
Foraging for food, probably.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not homeless. I don't forage.
I have a PhD.
On my count. One, two, three.
Okay, start her on one gram of cefazolin.
We need to clean this out. Page plastics.
I'll do it.
All right, Lisa, is there anyone you'd like for us to call?
My boyfriend.
I was in that trash chute for two days.
He's probably worried sick.
His name is Ted.
If his wife answers,
hang up and try again in an hour.
This can't be legal.
It is.
The hospital is allowed to create any policy
regarding co-workers dating that they see fit.
Shepherd met Grey while she was an intern.
And what about Warren and Bailey?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're married, so just...
If dating co-workers is frowned upon,
how are they supposed to meet anyone?
I'm good. You don't have to worry about me.
You spend half your life here, Shane.
This is your dating pool.
Why am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?
They shouldn't be able to do this to us.
Nobody's doing anything to you.
This is being done for you.
One of your own didn't feel safe at work
and lodged an anonymous complaint.
One of our own?
You realize you just made my relationship illegal.
Pretty sure he just said it was anonymous.
Yeah, right.
That's a giant mass.
Could be a met.
She had brain cancer six years ago,
and Torres is doing a biopsy on a possible osteosarcoma.
Three cancers by the ripe, all at age of 16.
That's bad luck or something genetic.
Bailey's gonna test for a link.
What do you think?
Highly invasive.
I don't think you can remove it
without shrinking it first.
What if she doesn't respond to chemo?
Then we still need to figure out
a surgical approach that won't just kill her.
We need to be as aggressive as this cancer.
Okay.
All right, folks.
You're gonna study her case files, look at the scans.
I want you to come up with a surgical treatment plan.
The board did you a favor with this new rule.
You're gonna take all that brain power you use
to devote to penises and vaginas and put it to some good use.
Um, can we, uh, use other doctors as resources?
What, like your wife?
Yes, you should, and you can.
Work as a team.
Bounce ideas off of one another.
You come up with something, I'm all ears.
So, uh, you guys want to start
throwing some ideas around or...?
I'm good on my own.
My flight leaves at 9:00 tonight.
The cab's gonna pick me up here.
The kids are in daycare.
The laundry is clean and folded,
and the kitchen is fully stocked.
It's one last interview.
You've said that before the last two interviews.
I know. I will see you before I leave.
Where you going?
Uh, actually, I have another interview with the white house.
Oh, show-off.
Hey, do you want to sleep over?
You can help me try and figure out
why my research isn't working.
And you can help me with the kids.
Mnh-mnh. Sounds like fraternization.
We could talk about Owen and Emma.
Oh, what's there to talk about?
They're moving in. Whatever.
I have wine.
I'll be there.
Yeah. Figured.
For you.
So, we're supposed to fill this whole thing up with spit?
No. To the line.
How?
Think about dill pickles.
Oh, my God. It works.
Every time.
And this is going to tell you...?
If there's a genetic reason
why you all keep getting cancer.
Well, it's got to be in my wife's side.
There's been a couple of breast,
a pancreas, a lung, and a butt.
Oh, and Billy's balls.
But we keep surviving.
We beat cancer.
Yep.
That's what we do.
Go ahead and alert the O.R. I have a debride leg repair.
Right away, doctor.
God, Lisa.
I told you not to come to the party.
I also told you not to have a secret affair
with the head of the sociology department, by the way.
I know. I know. You're right.
But, you know, I wasn't going to go,
but then everyone from the department was going.
It would have looked strange if I wasn't there.
Really?
You don't think getting stuck in his trash chute
with a piece of fish in your hair
looks more strange than not going to a party?
How did this happen?
Well, you know, he ignored me all night,
which maybe I'm -- I'm used to
because that's how we are in public.
But after a while, I just --
I couldn't take it anymore.
So, I grabbed my coat and made a break for the door,
but just as I was about to leave,
he called my name, and I stopped because --
finally.
But all he did was ask if I'd mind
throwing out the trash on my way out.
And I didn't know what to say,
so I-I-I took the bag, the big, smelly trash bag,
and I tossed it in the chute.
But I was so mortified because I didn't realize
I had thrown my purse along with it.
So, you jumped in after it?
Oh, I clearly make excellent choices.
Does Ted know what happened?
No. I didn't tell him.
I was trying to preserve your dignity.
Thank you.
I didn't realize there was nothing left to preserve.
Um, well, I certainly can't do anything about your dignity,
but if we're gonna preserve this leg,
we need to get you right up to the O.R.
Is that a shrimp tail?
Oh, no, that's a prawn.
Ted's wife prepared them.
They were actually really good.
Oh, my god.
Well, the prelim path report
looks like high-grade osteosarcoma.
But we'll need another day to get the final report.
We still need to figure out
what's going on in her chest.
Yeah.
Hey! Did you show Kepner?
No, no, no, she's working with Avery all day,
so I didn't want to brag.
Ah, good call.
But then we had coffee, and it sparkled,
so I ended up, you know, showing it off, anyway.
There were -- there were squeals.
Hey, Karev, do you notice anything different about me?
No.
Callie gave it to me.
We're trying to unpack a box a day.
So, this morning, Callie was --
Hey, you know, most people at least pretend
to like this story, so --
Alex, you can't keep ignoring my pages.
We really need to talk.
Not now.
If not now, when?
We can't sneak off to have a private conversation.
It's forbidden!
Oh, will you stop? It's just a stupid rule.
Nobody's taking it seriously.
I'm taking it seriously.
You don't have to worry about it because you have seniority,
but I'm a resident.
This is my reputation we're talking about, my career.
I know that you think the rule is crap,
but we can't just ignore it at my expense.
You're overreacting!
No, I'm not!
Oh, so, what, you're just gonna roll over
and let the hospital tell you who you can be with?
There isn't a choice.
There's always a choice!
You can choose to make the best out of a bad situation.
You can choose to act like an adult.
You can choose not to pick a fight
in front of the entire hospital.
You want to walk around here
and pretend like we don't mean anything to each other?
Fine. I'll make it easy for you.
We don't mean anything to each other,
not anymore, 'cause we're done!
That is not what I want.
Oh, screw it!
Alex!
Are you okay?
How was that?
Alarmingly convincing.
Just stop freaking out, okay?
Now I will.
Thanks for doing that for me.
I'll see you tonight.
You know, I appreciate the dinner date,
but I thought Webber told you people to work together.
We're not gonna get anywhere that way.
I-I know this non-fraternization policy
is gonna be beneficial in the long run,
But for now, it just gives those kids
one more reason to shut me out.
Um, just who are you trying to fraternize with?
Um, my wife.
They're mad at me because I get to be happy.
Seems hardly fair.
I agree.
But, uh, you know, they're gonna hate me anyway.
So, uh, might as well get something out of it, right?
Ben Warren, we are at work.
But you can lock that door.
Oh, my god.
Already?
I haven't even gotten started yet.
No, um, there's a mutation in the p53 gene.
What does that mean?
Emma probably keeps a nice home,
has window treatments, uses place mats.
Oh, place mats are overrated.
I want him to be happy.
I'm enjoying torturing Derek.
Does that make me a terrible person?
It's weird, though.
It's really over.
I'm empty.
That window is closing.
She is gonna give him babies.
And then he's gonna be somebody's daddy.
And then it's really over.
But you guys are divorced and seeing other people.
Doesn't that mean it's really over, anyway?
Oh, come on.
You should know better than anyone
that that is not true.
But somebody's daddy?
You kind of can't get between that.
You're supposed to be on a plane.
They called me before I even left to go to the airport
and cancelled the interview.
Well, what does that mean?
The president dumped him.
You know, I'm out. I'm out.
You guys, uh, have, uh, a good night.
I'm catching a cab.
Bye, bye, bye.
Kiss to the girls.
I think I'm gonna turn in.
You don't know that it's over.
What did they say?
I better turn in.
Congratulations!
I heard you're moving...
in with Emma!
Um, yeah.
We might, yeah.
Yeah, so I brought you some wine!
Wait. This is a very nice bottle of wine.
Yeah, I know.
Uh, uh, I swiped it from Derek's collection.
It looked really expensive.
So, enjoy!
The both of you.
Oh, no, Emma's -- she's not here.
So, what's the plan now?
Should I start sneaking in your bedroom window?
You -- you do live with one of the board members.
I told you -- she's at Mer's.
Yeah, I'm not just talking about tonight.
Look. Things will blow over.
I'll work on Mer and Cristina.
This will all go away.
Until then, yeah,
maybe you sneak in my bedroom window.
But Yang's supposed to be out all night tonight.
Yeah. You want to go upstairs?
I would, but upstairs is just so far away.
I got so many compliments on my ring today.
It's so sad, though, about Alex and Wilson.
Oh, yeah.
It's not fair, right, that we get to be so happy
and other people have to be so miserable?
Yeah, like April -- just out in the cold.
I feel terrible.
Awful.
Who am I gonna sleep with?
The -- the hospital is my dating pool.
You -- you are making it impossible
for me to get laid.
Well, I don't think that has ever been a problem.
Yeah, well...
Are you sad
there weren't any window treatments at the firehouse?
What?
You know, drapes and, uh,
the thing that goes on top of it.
Uh... what are they called?
It's a -- curtain rod?
Mnh-mnh. No.
I mean, yes, obviously you need that,
but there's that other thing.
I should know this.
My mother is an interior decorator.
I spent my childhood
listening to her talk about these things.
Who are you -- are you --
Mom? Hey, it's me.
Yes. Yeah, I know it's late.
No, I'm fine.
Listen, uh, what do you call,
Uh, those things that are on top of your windows?
No, the other thing.
Valance! Yes!
Thank you. Okay, good night.
Valance.
Were you -- were you sad
we -- we -- we never had valances?
No.
No.
A little bit?
No. No.
I'm not sad...
that we didn't have valances.
It never occurred to me, you know,
to get window treatments.
I'll put them in for you.
Great. Thank you.
Hey, sorry I couldn't come by last night.
Oh, no, no, it's -- it's -- it's fine.
I had three surgeries,
including an emergency "C" at 28 weeks.
Baby's fine.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, it is. It was.
And so are you.
And I wanted to say something in person,
but I'm...
Okay, I'm just nervous, so I'm just gonna say it.
So, we're gonna look at houses,
and there's gonna be that awkward conversation
about how many bedrooms we need,
awkward because this is kind of new
and we haven't really talked about kids,
and houses have bedrooms, and kids go in bedrooms.
So, um, okay, I'm just gonna--
I would like two kids, maybe three,
and I plan on not working until they're in school
and being the kind of mom that walks them to school,
so I need a good school district.
I'm freaking you out.
Um-- crap.
When I went over this in the car,
uh, it didn't sound so
"Marry me and sire my children."
It was reasonable.
No, it--
It is.
You should be talking about this stuff.
Good.
I'm not crazy.
Mnh-mnh, no, you're not crazy.
Okay, then.
So, I'll meet you back here tonight,
and we'll go to the real-estate agent.
Yeah. Okay.
Bye.
It's time to rethink the plan.
Hey. What did you find?
Oh, Rory has Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
Li for what?
Never even heard of it.
Neither had I.
It's an extremely rare genetic condition
due to a mutation in the p53 gene
that suppresses the ability to regulate cell growth.
The poor kid can't fight off tumors.
So, as soon as you cure one cancer, another one pops up.
Yeah. That's awesome.
Now, I'm meeting with the family today.
I'd like to be able to tell them
we have some sort of plan in place for Rory.
Okay, so, that chest tumor might not even be a met
from the osteosarcoma.
That makes chemo that much more complicated.
Okay, the tumor in her leg should respond
to doxorubicin, plus cisplatin.
Radiation's out.
It would make her too susceptible to new tumors.
The chest tumor's so vascular,
even a biopsy would be pushing our luck.
How rare is this?
Only a few hundred families are reported in the literature.
We need those case studies,
but, I mean, that could take awhile.
Not if I get those residents on it.
Sorry I'm late. I'm doing scut for Hunt.
Well, it'll get handled. This is more important.
All right, listen up.
Your assignment's changed.
Rory has Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
It's rare.
Dig up every case of it you can find.
Find out what worked, what didn't.
I want one of you to look for Dr. Karev.
He's with the oncologist.
I will.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Got to face him sometime.
Now, you can't rely solely on the internet.
Hit the library.
Now.
Uh, Ross, a word?
You've been quiet.
I don't know what's going on in your head,
but if it's too soon to come back full time,
we can talk.
No.
Just trying to keep my head down and work, sir.
Well, if you feel like you have something to say,
speak up, son.
Keeping it inside won't help you or anyone else.
The last time I spoke up, a patient nearly died.
That was grief and exhaustion talking.
I'd like to hear you talk.
Thank you.
Of course.
You shoud put me back in O.R. rotation.
Start clipping aneurysms again.
Derek.
Hey.
Dr. Hunt.
Well, it would be good to have you back.
It used to be all I wanted to do.
I'm grateful that they approached me for the project
and that you pushed me towards it.
It wasn't about Washington or the accolades.
They're looking for answers
to questions I've been asking my whole career.
And to know that that project is out there --
I mean, how do I go back to being satisfied
doing neurosurgery again?
Yeah.
Your standards have changed.
Yeah.
My standards have changed.
We were able to clean it out in surgery.
And now we're gonna let this vacuum dressing work its magic
and start the healing process.
Oh, my God, those are beautiful.
Did Ted send them?
No.
They're from your mom.
Oh, damn it, Lisa. Really?
No, it's not Ted.
I mean, it is Ted.
You're right. I'm insane.
This whole thing has made me certifiably crazy.
I am a college prefessor.
I'm supposed to be, you know, smart.
But instead I'm jumping into trash chutes
and bursting into tears because I'm heartbroken
that my mom cares about me more than some jerk
who won't even talk to me in public!
What is that?
Can you hand me my phone?
I just want to call my mom and thank her for the flowers.
Sure.
You're gonna call Ted, aren't you?
I'm a monster.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we need to go public with this thing, okay?
I can't keep track of when and where
I can put my arms on my own wife.
Look. I know it's hard.
But the whispers and the stares after the wedding
have just started to die down.
As soon as we tell people,
they're just gonna start up again.
Yeah.
Plus, I like our secret, little marriage bubble.
Sneaking around is kind of sexy.
I am so proud that you're my wife.
I am married to a brilliant, gorgeous trauma surgeon,
and I just don't want to hide it anymore, you know?
Okay, that's even sexier.
So what do we do?
I think we should start telling people.
In a more, uh, controlled setting.
Just -- doctor.
Well, it looks like we're gonna get you started on chemo soon.
I saw mom talking to Dr. Bailey.
There were tears.
Oh, wow. Thanks for the cancer genes, mom.
If you have it, I have it.
Oh, you haven't been sick a day in your life.
You have dad's nice, safe genes.
Maybe not.
We'll find out after the test.
You know, you don't have to find out if you don't want to.
Knowledge sucks.
Your face sucks.
Oh, come on. I'm not kidding.
I know we like to act like this isn't a big deal
and we're the family that beats cancer,
but we're not actually beating anything.
I mean, like, I can handle one cancer at a time,
but it's all I see now --
just cancer after cancer until I'm dead.
And I wish I could go back and un-know that.
She can say no, right?
It's her decision.
Not according to mom and dad.
They say I need to know because it'll determine whether I take an aspirin
or get a brain scan for a headache.
And if I'm gonna have kids, I need to know --
Kids? You're a kid.
I'm just saying, all right?
Mom and dad are freaking out,
And they're calling the whole damn family
and wanting everyone to get a test
and wanting to start a foundation
and change the world
and be like the family that fights Li-Fraumeni.
Who cares what they want? What do you want?
I can really decide for myself?
Even though I'm only 16
and my parents say that I have to?
I can say no? I can make the decision?
It's your life.
Nobody can make you do anything you don't want to do.
Hey. I need the oncology report on Rory.
They said we should add methotrexate
for the osteosarcoma.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, what -- what are you doing?
I'm done sneaking around.
They can't tell us what to do or what to feel.
If they want to fire me, fine.
We had a plan. What happened?
Look. It's a stupid plan.
We're adults. We love each other.
They can go screw themselves.
What was that?
Is somebody in there?
Hey, guys.
You want to just hand me my shirt?
Mine, too.
Hi.
Appreciate it.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
No!
Dr. Webber. This isn't what it looks like.
Well, I'm fired.
We're not fired.
You're not. You're an attending.
I'm an expendable resident.
The rules are just a dumb thing on paper
to cover the board's ass.
No one actually cares.
Well, speaking
as the hypocritical board member in the room,
the board cares.
Since when are you two still doing it?
Since the wedding.
Nice.
What?
I'm deciding whether this makes me
hate you more or less.
More.
Hey, well, um, since we have you guys here,
there's something that we wanted to share...
Oh, no.
Think he's still out there?
There's only one way to find out.
You guys want to close the --
No?
Hey.
Hey. I need a consult.
Okay.
So, my project is at a standstill
unless I hand it over to a bioengineer.
Okay.
What's your pitch?
Become a bioengineer.
I can't give Derek the satisfaction
of lightening my workload
because his guilt is my only ray of sunshine.
Well, he doesn't think he's gonna get the job,
if that makes you feel any better.
I know.
I actually feel kind of bad for him.
But I feel worse for me. I hate quitting.
Don't think of it as quitting.
You're waiting for science to catch up to your brilliance.
Think of it as --
As letting someone else take your project out for a spin.
You just step back, see what else is out there,
so when you come back to your project, you'll have fresh eyes.
It'll be better than ever, just like coming home.
You slept with Owen.
Yes, I did.
Don't.
Karev, talk to me.
She was hypertensive and unresponsive,
with absent breath sounds
over her left chest when I got here.
A needle for a tension pneumo.
Okay, we'll have to get her intubated.
Okay.
Ariel, I need you to go find your parents.
I couldn't wake her up
when the machine started beeping.
I tried, but -- - Look, this is not your fault.
We're gonna help your sister, okay?
Go find your parents. Go! Now!
Where the hell did all this blood come from?
Her tumor could have ruptured. We've got to get her to an O.R.
Guys, I just found a case of Li-fraumeni in Chicago.
The guy has almost the exact same types of cancers as Rory.
Uh, they tried neoadjuvant chemo to shrink it,
then surgery, and then, uh...
And?
And then he died.
I'm really sorry for what I'm about to say,
and I want you to know that I'm not trying to be mean,
but I think that you should hear it from me.
Jackson and April are still together.
What?
Webber just walked in on Alex, me, and them in a closet.
I-I'm confused.
You know, I-I know that you were trying to punish them
when you made your complaint, but they're fine, Steph.
They're great.
The only one who's being punished is me!
This is gonna force Alex and me apart!
Didn't you guys just break up?
No, we faked it.
I'm so confused.
You know what you do
when your little heart gets broken, Steph?
You talk about it with your friends.
You don't file a complaint!
I don't know how many times I have to tell you this.
It was an anon--
An anonymous complaint, which you file,
because you're afraid if people find out it was you,
they'd treat you like crap.
Instead of understanding or even trying to understand
that it wasn't some frivolous thing you did
because your little heart got broken,
but a decision you made because you felt like
your medical education had been compromised.
God, I don't even know why I bothered.
I should have just signed my name.
This job is a privilege and a gift,
and we are squandering it.
I almost lost my place in this program
because I got distracted... with Dr. Yang.
And you are all letting distractions
get in the way of our work.
We have a chance here to actually save this girl.
And I have an idea.
Look.
You slept with Yang?
The anatomy's all messed up.
The tumor's stuck to everything in here.
Let's try clamping the aorta,
that may temporarily help curb the bleeding.
Now I just have to find it.
This patient survived six types of cancers,
they were onto something.
Yeah, but then he died from a surgical complication.
So, if we combined radiofrequency ablation
with an anterior-approach en bloc resection...
Yes.
V-fib. Starting cardiac massage.
Charge the paddles to 10.
No, no, no, no.
Look. Look. Look.
This gives us good local control.
So we can treat the tumor
without compromising the healthy lung tissue.
Exactly.
Okay, charge to 20.
Clear.
All right. We got a rhythm.
It's weak, but it'll do.
Okay, let's get in there and find the source.
And we can get a biopsy while we're in there
to customize the chemo to her specific tumor.
This will work, guys.
Let's go tell Webber.
We got it! We figured it out!
You start with radiofrequency ablation.
Then you take the remainder out en bloc.
And the healthy tissue remains healthy.
Guys. - But here's a twist --
You can do a biopsy.
Which will customize her chemo.
That's not gonna work.
It might have.
It's a worthy pitch,
but Rory bled out into her chest tonight.
It looks like it tore into her aorta.
We did everything we could.
She died?
She died.
We tried everything.
No.
Oh, my god.
We're so sorry.
Do I have it?
The gene -- I want to know if I have it.
No, honey. Now is not the time.
No, now is the time, mom.
I want to know.
You know.
Dr. Bailey told you.
Ariel.
Do I have it?
Yeah.
It's okay. It's okay, mom.
I always wanted to be like her, and now I am.
I'm just like Rory.
Really? Webber told on us?
None of us want to be here, Karev.
Then why are we?
You're having a relationship with a subordinate,
and that is against policy.
Can we not talk about my pernal life?
I'd love to not talk about it, Alex,
but you are making me.
Now, I realize that we cannot legislate for romantic feelings.
Okay, obviously, what you do at home is your own business.
Look, we're just asking that, at work,
things remain strictly professional.
That's crap!
Alex.
It's okay for you all to flaunt
your relationships and your rings
and your -- your -- your happy, little lives
just because you're married?
Karev, just sit down.
No!
I'm not gonna let a bunch of hypocrites
tell me to keep my pants on at work
when this place was built on all of you
feeling each other up in our on-call room!
I'm done! Punish me! Whatever!
Okay, so, this is not how we wanted to tell you guys this,
because it could look like
we're trying to get off the hook,
which we are not.
But we -- we are married.
What?
Yes, April is my wife.
So, our supply-closet activity breaks no rules.
Since when?
Since the wedding.
My other wedding.
Kepner, you continue to surprise me.
Con-- congratulations.
Thank you.
Okay. So, I sh-- I should probably go.
I'm so sorry. Good luck.
Filing that complaint really took balls,
balls I didn't have.
Jo's gonna be so pissed at me, isn't she?
Oh, yeah, she is.
Hide at the bar?
Yes, please.
All right.
Shane, we're drinking. You're coming.
You can try to hide from a bully.
But hiding won't work for long.
You're gonna send her flowers, you're gonna apologize,
and then you are never going to see her again.
I'll take this outside.
Okay.
Tell him he kisses like a turtle's butt.
Is she breaking up with him for you?
I can't be trusted to do it. I'm crazy.
But the first step is admitting you have a problem, right?
No more secret romances, no more married men.
What are you doing this weekend?
You're beautiful.
And you've already seen me naked.
So, you might as well buy me dinner.
I actually already have plans with my wife, so...
Stuck in a trash chute -- check.
Prawn stuck in my leg -- check.
Embarrass myself in front of my surgeons -- double check.
Yeah. That about sounds right. I can die now.
You know, he really should wear a ring.
It's not fair,
going around looking like that without one.
Totally agree.
There's really only one way to win.
It's an interesting idea.
I wish we'd had a chance to give it a try.
You know, but maybe we'll be ahead of the game
for her sister.
It was -- it was a team effort.
I don't want to get ahead of myself,
but I think I'm starting
to make some headway with those kids.
Warren!
Dr. Bailey, we're gonna go to Joe's.
You mind? Can Ben come?
Go on.
Go play with your friends.
But don't stay out too late.
Sure you want to come?
Just rub that in our faces.
I'm gonna come out.
Believe me -- I'm gonna get home tonight.
You have to fight back.
I don't understand.
This morning, we were making plans to see houses together,
and now you want to break up.
I thought I knew what I wanted.
What, the house, the kids, or me?
Emma, I am so sorry.
Don't.
I don't need an apology.
I want an explanation.
Because the last time I checked, which was this morning,
we were on the exact same page, and now we're not.
What changed?
I want to come home to someone at night
who is equally as passionate about their work --
I am.
Emma, you --
You would give up surgery
in exchange for family.
That's a problem?
No. No, it's amazing -- for you.
I want you to have that --
house with the bedrooms and the kids.
It is a beautiful future.
But I want to come home at night
and exchange O.R. stories.
We want different things.
So it's me.
Emma, come on.
Please. Just please let me go.
Emma, Emma --
I'm gonna call a cab.
Will you wait a few minutes
so that I'm gone before you leave?
And if you're lucky enough to get out alive...
...take just a moment to celebrate...
The White House called.
You got it?
No, it's much bigger than that.
That's why the interview process was so exhaustive.
They want me on the advisory board.
They want me to run the thing.
You're mad.
No.
I'm not mad.
I-I just -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy for you.
But there isn't room
for me to take my career to the next level
and for you to run the thing.
Derek, that's frustrating.
Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna have sex with my husband...
...because three weeks is too long.
And I guess I do find
presidential appointments very sexy.
And then we can fight more later.
...before you put your guard back up,
ready to fight the next one.
