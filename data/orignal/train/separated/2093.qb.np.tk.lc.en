how &apos;s that happen to a malihini like you ?
you &apos;re just a baby .
i played for the honolulu sharks for a minute .
he , uh , came to visit once .
how &apos;d you end up here ?
blew out my ucl .
by the time my elbow healed ,
hawaii winter baseball folded .
so here i am .
what &apos;s up with this white van ?
oh . that &apos;s just manny . he delivers bread .
no worries , brah . you &apos;ll learn the route soon enough .
it &apos;s only your first day .
we good ?
we &apos;re good .
kid , get out !
please .
my wife &apos;s about to have a baby .
hey , you tired yet ?
i &apos;m not hiring your brothers . okay ?
best contractors on the island , brah .
save you the sweat .
and doing it myself will save me the money .
you come around , and when you do ,
i &apos;ll be right here to make that call .
all right , kamekona ? you want to hang around , that &apos;s fine .
why don &apos;t you pick up a hammer and make yourself useful ?
i already help .
you come to me to cut you a deal on the wood--
this the best on the island .
you mean this ?
you get what you paid for , brah .
this stuff don &apos;t grow on trees .
yo .
hey .
howzit , haole .
baby huey . that &apos;s good .
what &apos;s the matter with you , huh ?
we got a situation .
i &apos;ve been calling you like you owe me money .
what are you talking about ? i didn &apos;t hear my phone .
called you like five , six times .
i believe you . i didn &apos;t hear my phone ,
i left it right over here . where &apos;s my phone ?
you see my phone ?
oh . oh ... sorry .
you didn &apos;t feel that vibrating ?
ever ?
oh , that &apos;s what it was .
here .
you keep it .
you sure ?
yeah . you keep it .
it &apos;s an armored car heist .
two dead , one hanging by a thread .
kid &apos;s name is jordan townsend . he &apos;s 25 .
this kid looks like he &apos;s 12 .
what else we got ?
eyewitnesses say everything happened real fast .
all they can remember is that
the shooters were dressed like painters .
some say there were two , some say there were ten .
you know how that goes .
carl . get these kids out of here , huh ?
so where &apos;s the truck ?
they jacked it .
they jacked it ? doesn &apos;t seem suspect to you ?
why not just take the cash ?
maybe our cowboys needed a horse .
yeah , maybe , but driving around
in a stolen armored car &apos;s not exactly stealth .
they were able to disable the gps .
we &apos;re still looking for it .
downtown waikiki , broad daylight ...
obviously no regard for human life .
this is a bold crew .
all right , chin , contact the hpd and the tsa .
tell them we &apos;re looking for anybody trying to travel with
or unload a large amount of cash .
yeah .
all right , don &apos;t cancel your lunch plans--
we might be wrapping this one up sooner than you think .
really ?
yeah . i just talked to the company rep .
aeko kula security tags each bag of cash
with a tracking device .
cash is lojacked .
yeah . it &apos;s all part of some new secret security protocol
that started a couple weeks ago .
and you know what ? we have a hit .
all we got to do now is follow the money .
are you sure this is the place ?
yeah , the signal from the cash is coming from right here .
anyone up for a swim ?
ah , forgot to bring my board shorts .
looks like the rookie is going swimming .
i &apos;ll go in with you .
very nice of you .
sure you don &apos;t want to come for a swim ?
no , you go ahead , uh ... with your pants .
i &apos;ll just be here with a dry towel .
you know , you can create shortcuts on that thing .
type a letter and it &apos;ll finish the word for you .
just for the words you use a lot .
well , then , i &apos;d have to seriously consider
the words i use a lot .
that you would .
we found the money .
and the truck .
they drove it right off the pier .
that was pretty smart .
without the tracking device in the cash ,
we might never have found it .
uh , no chance the shooters are in there , right ?
trunk was empty , doors were open .
i get dumping the truck , but why the money ?
maybe this heist wasn &apos;t about the money .
it takes a very specific type of psycho to jack an armored truck .
you &apos;ve got guys with vests , guns already drawn ...
yeah , maybe they get a rush from it .
psychos .
all right . all right .
oh , what is that ? seaweed ?
yeah , seaweed .
yeah , we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll take the front .
all right , see what these guys left behind ,
besides the money .
hey , they ripped up the dash ,
like they were trying to look for something .
yeah , these trucks come equipped with a smart black box .
kinda like a flight recorder on a plane .
records every move on video .
yeah , the aeko kula rep said 24 hours &apos; worth .
could be useful to us .
yeah , if they didn &apos;t put a bullet in it first .
you could fix that , though , right , cuz ?
little elbow grease and a prayer ... maybe .
mask , broken strap .
this the only one back there ?
yeah .
maybe there was a struggle . it got caught on something .
wait a minute . paramedic said that the guard
who was still alive , he had defensive wounds on his hands .
so he tried to rip a mask off ...
maybe he saw a face .
what are the odds , huh ?
guy gets a bullet in the dome ,
goes through four hours of brain surgery ,
and he survives ,
yet 150 people die every year from falling coconuts .
it &apos;s a fact . i read it online .
what , so now you &apos;re not going to let grace go near coconut trees ?
not without a helmet , i &apos;m not .
hi .
excuse me .
uh , camille townsend ?
yes .
hey , uh , i &apos;m steve mcgarrett , from five @-@ o.
this is my partner , detective danny williams .
we &apos;re investigating the shooting .
we &apos;re really sorry about what happened to your husband .
i warned him not to take that job .
that it was too dangerous , but ...
he didn &apos;t listen to me .
we &apos;ve been together since we were 18 .
i just don &apos;t know how to be me without him .
you &apos;re not going to have to worry about that .
doctor said that he &apos;s strong ,
and he &apos;s going to pull through , so you got to be strong , too .
i heard that the other two men ... didn &apos;t make it .
no . they didn &apos;t .
your husband might be the only witness to this crime ,
so at some stage we &apos;re hoping we can talk to him .
yeah , obviously it &apos;s the last thing on your mind right now ,
but if you could , when he wakes up ,
please , give us a call .
of course .
it was his first day .
hey , listen . we &apos;re going to do
everything we can to find out who did this
to him , and to you , all right ?
pulled this from the security cam at the loading dock .
there are four shooters .
this is the best frame we have .
not much to go on .
all right , they knew we &apos;d pull video .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re wearing masks and coveralls .
exactly . also not helpful is a group of painters
standing nearby , dressed exactly like our thieves .
probably not a coincidence .
right .
so i put the video through our facial recognition software ,
and i got a hit from the hpd mug shot database .
gordon smith .
prior for two home robberies ,
got out of halawa six months ago .
i talked to his parole officer ,
who said he missed today &apos;s meeting .
okay . um ...
i &apos;m not a rocket scientist ,
but i think i know why he missed his meeting .
all right , well , let &apos;s set a meeting he won &apos;t miss .
hey , hey , hey , man !
what are you doing , man ? i didn &apos;t do nothing .
how &apos;d you even find me ?
oh , your p.o. told us . you remember him ?
he &apos;s the guy that you were supposed to see this morning , but didn &apos;t ,
therefore , you violated your parole . huh ?
so they sent five @-@ 0 after me ?
no , we don &apos;t care about that .
no , we don &apos;t , gordon ,
but what we care very much about
is why you missed your appointment .
so please tell me , tell me ,
when did you go from boosting laptops
to capping people in the back of the head ?
i don &apos;t know what you talking about .
that &apos;s not true . you were there .
where ?
don &apos;t play dumb , gordon . i hate that .
it &apos;s a personal pet peeve of mine , all right ?
you were at fort and king at 8 : 00 a.m. this morning , okay ?
we have you on camera
while an armored truck heist is going down .
look , man , i went straight in the joint and found the lord .
i didn &apos;t do nothing wrong . all i did was answer an ad .
what ad ?
gavinslist for paint work .
they said meet there wearing a white jumpsuit ,
a hat , dust mask .
offering $ 30 an hour , cash money .
i figured my p.o.
would be all right if i miss our meeting for a job .
who &apos;s the meet with ?
i don &apos;t know . no one ever showed .
left me standing there with a bunch of other dudes .
then people started shooting , so i took off .
all right , go over there .
don &apos;t give me a look . i need some privacy .
the ad was a fake .
yeah .
our shooters didn &apos;t want a group of painters .
they wanted a bunch of guys at the site
wearing exactly the same thing .
a bunch of clones to create mass confusion .
that &apos;s it .
i think i &apos;m gonna enjoy catching these guys .
we need to find out when
that gavinslist ad was posted and by whom .
chin , you get anything off the box ?
well , i got what used to be something .
when our friend shot up the black box
it damaged the sd card that holds all the video .
i &apos;m trying to get it out without making it worse ,
but it &apos;s slow going .
ballistics came back .
it turns out the same guns were used
at a waikiki bank heist a year ago .
four perps wearing masks .
what was the target ?
the internal vault at oahu federal bank .
they killed two guards .
got away with close to $ 4 million .
wow . any suspects ?
no . unfortunately , it happened during
the annual koko crater classic triathlon .
streets were closed .
hpd was spread thin .
no one even knows how they got in or out .
but i ran the stats through an fbi database ,
and in the last year ,
there have been high @-@ end , four @-@ person robberies
in boulder , san diego and austin .
wait a minute . all cities that host triathlons .
bingo . and the heists always happen during the race .
okay , so this is their m.o.
they use an event like this as a diversion .
guys , this city shuts down for the triathlon tomorrow .
okay , all right , if we &apos;re right ,
this crew is probably planning another hit ,
which means we have , like , 18 hours before
somebody else is gonna wind up dead .
okay . thank you very much .
who &apos;s that ?
camille townsend .
jordan &apos;s awake and he &apos;s talking .
let &apos;s hope he can i.d. a shooter .
what is with you today ? your phone is blowing up .
it &apos;s rachel , all right ?
the lawyers have decided that since we &quot; activate each other , &quot;
that e @-@ mail would be a better form of communication .
except i hate e @-@ mail . i &apos;m never sitting at a computer ,
and i can &apos;t type on this thing &apos; cause i got goofy thumbs .
why don &apos;t you try turning it sideways ?
what &apos;s that gonna do ?
it makes the things bigger . i &apos;m just trying to help .
commander mcgarrett , detective williams ,
i &apos;m meredith michaels , channel 9 news .
do you have any leads on the armored car heist ?
no comment .
what is the press even doing here ?
we &apos;re going live in ten minutes .
i &apos;m hoping to get a comment from jordan townsend ,
the surviving guard .
okay , turn that off , please , all right ?
jordan townsend is a potential witness
for a double homicide , okay ?
the people that did this ,
they do not want him to talk . you understand that ?
you putting his name out there , it only puts his safety at risk .
jordan &apos;s condition was reported
from the crime scene three hours ago .
room 218 , code blue .
code blue , room 218 .
the doctor said everything was fine . i just went and got some coffee .
what happened in five minutes ?
did you catch that ?
yeah , why is he wearing a mask ?
hey , excuse me , doctor . doctor ?
sir , sir , i &apos;m talking ...
be my eyes .
okay , three ...
... four ...
five ...
five . he stopped at five .
hey , tell me something .
who can outrun an elevator going hand over hand up a cable ?
besides you ? i have no idea .
i got the whole hospital on lockdown .
yeah , but without a face , we don &apos;t know
who we &apos;re looking for .
i got two uniforms at jordan &apos;s door
and i got security at every exit .
still nothing .
how &apos;s jordan ?
doctor said he suffered . an embolism .
took air through a syringe through his iv .
he &apos;s unconscious . they &apos;re looking after him right now .
what about camille ?
her husband almost died twice today .
what do you think ?
i think if jordan was targeted ,
he must &apos;ve seen something .
kono .
that gavinslist ad for painters ?
i tracked down the ip address through a wifi router .
it was posted from a chiropractor &apos;s office in kaimuki .
clear .
clear here .
i got blood !
yeah , me too .
building manager said dr. kinkirk &apos;s been
out of town for the last three weeks .
had no idea the office even had people in it .
is that blood ?
yeah .
looks like our guys are dopers .
what does that mean ?
you draw a pint of your own blood ,
your store it in the fridge , and then you reinject it days later .
why , what for ?
increases your red cell count
and it allows your muscles to work harder for up to 12 hours .
some seals in coronado would do it
before their underwater drills .
kinda like an all @-@ natural steroid .
yeah , for vampires .
or ultra @-@ endurance athletes .
if these guys are dopers ,
maybe our shooters
are gonna be in the triathlon for real .
it would explain the tarzan stuff in the elevator .
it &apos;s a perfect alibi . you pull a heist in the middle ;
you still finish the race , but you claim to have
been in the race the whole time . it &apos;s perfect .
where &apos;s he go ... ?
where are you going ?
oh , they got a cleaning crew for that , babe .
do you need help ?
oh ! oh , i get it !
steve the science guy is back .
i need a print .
boss , i have a print kit in my car .
there &apos;s no time .
yeah , i got the print . i &apos;m running it now .
okay , did you get anything off the sd card from the black box ?
after all that , it &apos;s empty as in brand @-@ new .
the thieves must &apos;ve switched it out with the real one
before they shot up the box .
i don &apos;t understand .
why go to all the trouble ?
probably for the same reason they drove the truck off the pier ;
they want to slow us down and create another diversion .
they weren &apos;t just covering their tracks .
they were covering what they stole .
they wanted the video off that card .
yeah , but what for ?
i asked myself the same question .
so i pulled the video off another truck in aeko kula &apos;s fleet .
their cameras cover four different angles
including the driver &apos;s side and the front .
okay , so they got video footage of what , entry points , of gates ...
wait a minute .
they &apos;ve also got a peek at every pass code on that truck &apos;s route .
the video was the whole reason they stole the truck .
this whole thing is recon for their next hit .
i mean , having that information is almost as good as having the keys .
chin , we need to break down all the stops on jordan &apos;s route , okay ,
and start narrowing in on potential targets .
hey , i just got a hit from the fingerprint on the blood bag .
it &apos;s a local guy named kai rollins .
he &apos;s in the system for a string of liquor store robberies .
all right , where do we find him ?
you need a spot , kai ?
nah , i got it .
come on . i insist .
can i help you ?
let &apos;s talk story .
first thing i want to know is
what you were doing at kinkirk &apos;s chiropractic ?
never heard of it .
i think you have .
fo &apos;real ?
what is a human life worth to you , kai ?
$ 25,000 ? $ 35,000 ?
$ 45,000 ? half a million ? what ?
personally , i think it &apos;s relative .
i mean , every human life has got to be worth
a different amount , right ?
stop !
stop what ? you want some more weight ?
what &apos;d he say ?
i &apos;ll put ... we &apos;ll put more weight .
more weight .
that should be easy for you , right ?
you got that extra pint of blood pumping through your veins .
give you that big boost .
is this about the doping ?
no , it &apos;s about jacking an armored car
and shooting three people .
your fingerprints ,
they &apos;re on a blood bag at a doctor &apos;s office .
look , my girlfriend does housekeeping for that building .
dr. kinkirk travels a lot ,
so i use the office sometimes
to supply doping equipment to the triathletes .
help them draw blood .
you might have found one of my bags ,
but i don &apos;t know anything about ...
an armored car heist .
i need a name , kai . i mean ,
group of four-- see what you can remember .
there was a woman .
sabrina something .
lives local .
needed supplies for four .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s something .
a woman named sabrina , kai .
taut , buddy . real taut .
you know , i just had a thought .
don &apos;t hurt yourself .
that &apos;s funny .
we &apos;re going after this sabrina person
based on @-@ on the statement of a meathead .
well , she &apos;s the only sabrina
on the triathlon roster who lives on the island .
that &apos;s true .
matches his description .
why , what are you getting at ?
well , we have gordon on tape at the crime scene ,
we have kai &apos;s fingerprints .
all this lady did was go out and buy some medical supplies
and enter a triathlon .
last time i checked , neither of those are illegal .
we can &apos;t go knock down her door
and pin her to the ground , you know what i mean ?
okay , is there a plan of attack in there somewhere ?
absolutely .
we sit on her , we wait ,
we see who comes , we see who goes .
i mean , we got three accomplices we &apos;re looking for , right ?
right .
well , danny , these people use bystanders for target practice ,
okay , and if they are using the race as a cover ,
then we only have 14 hours before they pull their next heist .
exactly-- without hard evidence ,
we need to catch &apos; em in the act
or else we &apos;re going to spook &apos; em , scare &apos; em ,
and then we won &apos;t catch &apos; em at all .
why are you going this way ?
this is the street where sabrina james rents a house .
kono pulled the information off her triathlon application .
the house is rented to a seth james , her husband .
check your e @-@ mail .
e @-@ mail .
i know . i know . turn it sideways .
okay . uh , so you realize we can &apos;t see anything .
i know .
not exactly optimal
for our , uh , &quot; let &apos;s sit on them &quot; plan .
i just said i know .
why are you so angry ?
because i am an angry person .
okay ? can you just pull up ?
please .
to where ? this is their house .
just , please , okay ? i know somebody .
please .
danny , what are you doing here ?
uh , i need a favor .
how did you even get in the gate ?
because the code is still grace &apos;s birthday .
i told you to change it 15,000 times ,
but you don &apos;t listen to me .
so , perhaps , you &apos;d care to explain
what it is you &apos;re doing on my front porch
and who your friend is with the luggage .
uh , this is my partner , steve mcgarrett .
steve , this is my lovely ex @-@ wife , rachel .
absolutely not .
okay , then i &apos;ll just talk to stanley .
okay , he &apos;s a goof ,
but at least he &apos;ll listen to reason .
stanley !
stan is on a business trip to indonesia .
you know , i knew that you
would find a way to engage with me while he was gone .
okay , this has nothing to do with you and i.
you have potential murder suspects living next door .
we just need access so we can surveil .
surveil ?
yeah . yeah , surveil ,
and then we &apos;ll be out of your hair .
trust me-- they &apos;re bad people .
you don &apos;t want them walking around your neighborhood .
you got grace and , you know ...
have you noticed anything unusual about their behavior ?
not unusual .
i think they moved in a few months ago .
they &apos;re renters .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
just that they &apos;re only here for a short time .
they tend to keep to themselves .
sorry . you had a rather large chip there .
okay , rachel , i know that this isn &apos;t ideal ,
but we don &apos;t have much time and we need your help .
very well . the two of you can do what you like .
i &apos;m picking grace up from school and checking into a hotel .
uh , you can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m not your suspect .
i understand that ,
but we all just need to act normal .
uh , if you start breaking routines ,
they may get suspicious .
oh , rachel , i got an idea .
why don &apos;t you take gracie over to laura &apos;s for a sleepover ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s only been asking for , like , three months .
and i &apos;m supposed to just stay here ?
i &apos;m not thrilled about the situation , either .
this-- no .
so , uh , if it &apos;s all good , we &apos;ll , uh ,
find a spot upstairs , and we can get
a good vantage point on the house next door and ...
get to work .
this is ... this is ridiculous , okay ?
nobody needs a bed this big .
i mean , my whole apartment could fit into this bed frame .
it &apos;s over compensation . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s absurd .
i mean , this room-- it does have the best view , danny .
you &apos;re having fun with this ? you &apos;re enjoying this ?
i want to rip my face off ,
and you &apos;re enjoying this ?
would anyone like tea ?
do not mock me , daniel .
i wasn &apos;t mocking you . i wasn &apos;t mocking you .
i think it &apos;s cute . we &apos;re doing a stakeout ,
and you &apos;re offering teatime .
it &apos;s called civilization .
would you care for anything , commander mcgarrett ?
no , thank you , rachel .
um , but could you tell me how many people live next door ?
just a couple .
so two ?
last i checked , that &apos;s what a couple was .
that &apos;s cute .
oh , you know what we should do ?
uh , we &apos;re about to take them down ,
so maybe beforehand , we invite them over
for a game of tennis-- tea and tennis .
bite me .
that &apos;s very civilized .
she &apos;s cool , man .
she &apos;s cool . i don &apos;t know how you got her .
how did i get her ?
hey . i am a good catch .
no , really , how &apos;d you get her ?
seriously , uh , she hit me .
she hit you ?
yeah .
she hit you with what ? with her fists ?
like in the face ?
no , no , no . she , uh ...
she was new to the states , and , uh ,
she wasn &apos;t used to driving on the right side of the road .
and , um , she saw a cop car
and she got flustered , so she rear @-@ ended me .
all right , so i get out of the car ,
and i offered to give her driving lessons
instead of giving her a ticket .
pretty smooth , bud .
yeah , well , i was just ... just being nice .
and she did have a very nice tushie .
apparently , the , uh , the london school of economics
does not have driver &apos;s ed ,
so driving lessons turned into dates ,
and then dates turned into a two @-@ bedroom in weehawken .
she woke up married to a cop .
that &apos;s not so bad .
no . uh , that &apos;s what i thought , but ...
all right . we &apos;re up and running here .
enjoying your tea ?
yeah , i like tea . you want ... you want a cup ?
no . i &apos;m good . thanks .
we got movement .
all right . you want some fresh air ?
uh , yeah .
go .
okay , guys .
we got the suspects-- they &apos;re heading south
in a maroon suv .
copy that . we &apos;re on it .
think they &apos;re going on a dry run ?
let &apos;s hope so .
we got to find out what they &apos;re after .
all right , i &apos;m in .
what do you got ? you got anything ?
no , i don &apos;t have anything yet
in the seven seconds i &apos;ve been here , okay ?
no guns , no plans for world domination
next to the cereal box .
nothing . can i have a couple seconds , please ?
so what happened to you two anyway ?
happened with you two who ? what are you talking about ?
you and rachel .
you &apos;re breaking up . i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m going to send you something right now .
looks like a map of downtown ,
highlighted .
i think i just successfully sent a photograph .
all right , i got , uh , registration packets ,
some sort of electronic bracelet .
you know , long @-@ distance races issue
digital timing chips to all participants .
they keeps track of time , they record gps locations .
just send me the numbers .
we &apos;ll try to keep a tab on them when they &apos;re in the race .
when did exercise get so complicated ?
and there it is--
the third time we &apos;ve passed the moana surfrider .
we &apos;re going in circles .
do you think they know we &apos;re tailing them ?
no . i &apos;ve kept eyes on all their mirrors .
they &apos;re not looking at us .
then , what are they looking at ?
i don &apos;t know . this whole strip is door @-@ to @-@ door jewelry stores .
all high @-@ value targets .
we can put hpd on alert , but ...
where do we tell them to start ?
i thought they were taking the armored truck route .
this doesn &apos;t match up .
yeah , and that &apos;s the fourth triathlon blockade we passed .
we keep going off the triathlon route .
what if they &apos;re not casing the target ?
what if they &apos;re mapping their escape route ?
how &apos;s it going ?
kind of slow , actually .
hey , i &apos;m sorry again to invade your space .
it &apos;s all right .
sometimes i let my emotions get the better of me .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s danny .
so he &apos;s in there in the house with the killers ?
yeah , he &apos;s okay , though .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s alone . no one there .
you know , um , you don &apos;t have to worry .
danny &apos;s a great cop .
he ... he knows what he &apos;s doing .
i know .
i used to tell myself that every day he went to work .
did it help ?
not really .
danny , danny , you got to move , man .
i got the other two suspects coming in through the garage .
nice lead time , buddy .
i &apos;m sorry .
they &apos;re going to be in there any second .
go , go !
have you got any flammables in the garage ?
any kerosene , gasoline ?
what ?
danny &apos;s in trouble , okay ?
i got to create a diversion .
oh . i have a thought .
did you leave that open ?
no .
maybe sabrina .
can you grab some more protein bars ?
what the hell was that ?
oh ... oh , god .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry . i ...
this is not my house or my gate .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
i ... perhaps , um ...
stan &apos;s going to have my head .
uh , we need to exchange the ...
insurance and ...
get your name and ... fix it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i ... had a bit of ...
... g and t.
names , though i &apos;m fairly certain they &apos;re fake .
maybe you can get prints off the pen .
&quot; prints off the pen &quot; ?
i was married to a cop , remember ?
that was the extent of our pillow talk .
okay , rachel , that &apos;s not right .
that &apos;s not true . not always .
okay , not always , but sometimes .
what happened ?
it had a little chat with the neighbor &apos;s gate .
nice work . thank you .
i feel like i &apos;ve seen this trick before .
well , worked once , right ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry , um ...
are you implying that when you hit me ,
when we met , you did it on purpose ?
danny , game time .
hold on .
suspects are leaving for the race .
i &apos;ll meet you at the car .
okay , um , i need a laptop .
you have a laptop ?
what for ?
i need , uh ...
i need to see what &apos;s on this .
our crew &apos;s still in the water .
so far , nothing out of the ordinary .
right , but we still don &apos;t know what the target is .
kono had hpd alert
all the banks and high @-@ end jewelry stores
along the triathlon &apos;s route .
okay , how are you going there , kitty ?
not good .
is that how they do it in jersey ?
no , it &apos;s not how they do it in jersey .
this is grace &apos;s computer .
it &apos;s the only one rachel could give me .
and whatever &apos;s on this flash drive
is taking forever to load .
it &apos;s the biggest file in the history of files .
the names that rachel got from the neighbors ?
they didn &apos;t check out .
but their prints came back : aaron and kim rockwell .
and i also contacted the triathlon .
they said that all four of our suspects
finished the race last year .
average times , but they did finish .
all right , so now we wait for them to go off course .
or we get them earlier .
aaron used to work for oahu federal bank last year
at the time of the heist .
it &apos;s enough to detain them on probable cause .
hey , rfid signal
shows our four perps leaving the water ,
getting onto their bikes .
let &apos;s go .
chin !
coming up . coming up .
one , two , three and four .
right here . one , two , three , and four .
stop ! stop ! take your helmet off .
helmets off .
what ?
it &apos;s not them .
they tagged these riders with their tracking chips .
which means they &apos;re pulling the heist right now .
danny .
all right , so , uh , looks like
they dumped video from the truck &apos;s sd card
onto this flash drive .
all the footage is of a place called bobrow imports ,
a south african diamond @-@ trading conglomerate .
that &apos;s our target for sure .
millions in diamonds are easier to transport
than millions in cash .
hey , i know that building .
it &apos;s , like , three blocks from here .
okay , well , cars are never going to be able to cut through this .
so let &apos;s go .
45 seconds
before motion sensors reacclimate .
ready , three , two , one !
kono , i need you on that roof .
copy that .
okay , i &apos;m in position .
i don &apos;t see ...
wait , hang on .
they &apos;re exiting the building from the mauka side .
all four them .
they &apos;re dressed as racers with black lumbar packs .
kono , talk to me .
tell me what &apos;s happening .
they &apos;re splitting up !
they &apos;re taking the four routes from the map .
i &apos;m coming down , i &apos;m going to take mission .
all right , this way .
i &apos;m on four .
hands behind your back . hands behind your back .
hands behind your back !
ride &apos;s over .
whoa , brah , your arm &apos;s all bust up ?
i think it &apos;s broke , man .
let me help you with that .
how &apos;s that sand taste ?
i can &apos;t thank you guys enough .
well , you don &apos;t have to thank us .
save your energy . you got to take care of that kid .
jordan , when you &apos;re feeling up to it ,
we &apos;re gonna show you some photos , okay ?
d.a. &apos; s gonna ask you to point out the shooter if you can .
of course .
any time .
i feel okay , actually . i just ...
i &apos;m so sorry to put cami through all this .
oh , no . i &apos;m fine , babe .
we &apos;re fine .
everything &apos;s fine .
now .
thanks for letting me use your computer .
did you catch the bad guys ?
did i catch ... who are you talking to ?
you always catch the bad guys .
that &apos;s true .
all right .
i made this for you .
thank you so much .
i mean , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m the luckiest guy in the world .
i love you . come here .
thank you , baby .
