Guys?
Please, okay? I don't even have a gun.
Isn't this against the rules?
There's only one rule, fat Neil.
The prize goes to the last man standing.
So to speak.
You--
If you were a dude, I'd have my fist up your balls.
Thank you, Annie.
Kick their guns to me.
Kick--don't reach.
Christina "Reach-y,"
I said kick.
Annie, take it easy.
You gotta learn to trust people.
Can't you leave me with a little something?
We're friends, Annie.
Remember?
We played Dungeons & Dragons together.
That was a game.
This is paintball.
Okay, a couple of announcements.
I want to thank Pistol Patty's Cowboy Creamery
for sponsoring our end-of-the-year picnic.
Now.
Free ice cream and that one guy
having a heart attack
aren't the only surprises today.
We're gonna end this year with a quick game
of paintball assassin.
Last year's big mistake was way too valuable a prize.
And I've been assured--
that this year will be different.
So take it away, Pistol Patty!
Howdy, folks.
There's only one rule.
Last man standing gets the prize.
There's your guns.
And here's the prize.
$100,000 cash.
Go nuts!
I heard a rumor you never shoot an unarmed man.
Whoever started that rumor didn't eat my beans.
Then I guess it's lucky for me I'm not unarmed.
Seeing as I'm...
eating your beans.
Jeff wants to see you.
Yeah? And I want pants.
A lot of people want a lot of things.
It won't hurt to hear him out, will it?
We got a good hiding spot in the library.
As safe as you are here, you'll be safer with us.
Math club's gotten a lot better since last year.
Obviously, they were practicing
while the rest of us went on dates.
Hold on. I have a plan.
Math club!
Yeah.
I'm Asian.
You guys Asian?
That's pretty racist, man.
That wasn't a no.
I'm coming over!
Don't shoot me, shoot him.
He's white, and he's out of ammo.
Crap.
See you, Abed.
Shoot Chang!
He defected to the math club.
Math rules!
Agh.
Forget it.
Just a waste of ammo.
Let's go grab their paint.
Yeah, I'm much safer with you guys.
M'lady.
What do you want, Jeff?
Yikes. Well, what do we all want?
Ammo.
How much you got left?
$100,000 worth.
Yeah, we're running low, too.
Shut up, abed.
Okay.
What have you heard about Pierce?
I hear he's still alive,
Holed up near the cafeteria.
Well, I hear he has more paint than a French kindergarten.
Are you proposing we join him?
I'm proposing his ammo joins us.
You haven't changed.
You think Pierce has?
Annie, let's not rehash this.
The guy's been a jerk all year.
He's a jerk because we exclude him.
We exclude him because he's a jerk.
And the last time I checked, you were the last one
feeling sorry about it.
I guess I'm still waiting for you guys to come around.
Likewise.
Okay, I'm-- I am dead now.
I'm dead.
Who wears spurs in paintball?
Who the hell are you?
The guy that's gonna win.
Come on!
Does that guy even go to this school?
He's really good-looking.
Like, network TV good-looking.
And did you see how big his guns were?
Why don't you just marry him, Abed?
I'm just saying paintball is tough this year.
I agree.
Careful, Britta.
You can't hit all three of us.
She won't have to.
Hey, Troy.
Abed!
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.
Guys.
Oh, right.
By the power invested in us as deputies,
we now pronounce you arrested.
Deputies? What are you, deputies of the stairwell?
Fort Hawthorne.
There's a bounty on your head, my friend.
Pierce.
My forehead's not that big, right?
Mm.
It's not small.
So you guys just let Pierce boss you around
in exchange for paint pellets?
Actually, Jeff, he's been pretty decent
in this game so far.
He's created a safe zone
where people can rest, eat, and if necessary,
pump their breast milk.
Wow, that sounds very nice of him.
Beats standing around with empty guns,
waiting to get picked off by the Black Rider.
Are you talking about the handsome blond cowboy
With the big guns?
Is that guy a student?
Who--who is he?
We just call him the Black Rider.
Okay, but he's not really riding anything.
Look, I don't name people, Annie.
I'm a deputy.
I deputize.
You have to surrender your guns.
Oh, and your drugs.
My study group.
How long has it been?
Five hours.
Too long.
Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.
How is this even possible?
It began with a dream, Annie.
A dream and an impulse to hide in the men's room.
I found that people were willing to roll bullets
under the door,
Just for the right to take a dump.
By the way, for you guys,
taking a dump's on the house.
Or if you prefer, relax and catch a show.
This is insane.
Don't worry, Jeff.
I've also got someone more your speed.
Because you're gay.
All right, I think I've seen enough,
and I'd like my gun back now.
Only Hawthorne personnel can
carry weapons inside, Jeffrey.
All right, you got us here unarmed,
at your mercy.
What do you want?
We'll discuss over dinner.
You're famished.
Tonight, we feast.
Ah, the twinkies are wonderful tonight.
Give us some space, Miguel.
What if I told you guys I know where to find
enough ammo to end this cowardly hiding out
and split the prize seven ways?
So send your goons to get it.
Ah, they'd never bring it back.
We trust each other. We're a study group.
That's pretty warm and fuzzy talk
coming from you, Pierce.
Mm-hmm, you've kind of acted like a villain this year.
I have?
Well--
A little bit.
You guys.
Pierce is reaching out.
I'm not risking my butt hauling ammo back
for the guy that has Vicky dancing for twinkies.
She's a dance major, Jeff.
And she loves twinkies.
And if you ever took the time to get to know her--
Look.
Uh, summer starts tomorrow.
For you guys, it means pool parties,
dinners, one-night stands.
For me...
It means counting down the days 'til next fall.
Before we go, let me do this for you.
Let me bring us victory.
Fine.
Let's do it.
To the study group.
To the study group.
More juice, Miguel.
I hope we find this cache of ammunition soon.
I need to pump.
Me, too.
You talkin' about peeing, right?
No.
Me, neither.
Okay, about Pierce.
I feel bad.
I shouldn't put so much effort into--
It's okay. I just think--
the study group is my family, you know?
And if we start picking and choosing--
Where do we stop?
I get it.
You're a good kid.
And I wanna do my part to help you stay that way.
Benjamin Chang,
for your betrayal of the Cheerleaders' Alliance,
I sentence you to pretendsies death.
Guys?
You don't have to do this.
I betrayed the Math Club for you.
Ready...
Heather!
I'm sorry I told Trish about Amber!
Aim...
Fire.
Holy crap.
Not cool, bitch.
Yeah, so you told me at last year's tryouts.
Leave the guns.
Whatev.
Who's there?
Can I join you?
No!
Okay.
Damn it, I'm out. Gimme your gun.
All right, be careful.
Cheerleaders rule!
I'll take that.
Who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Stop trying to fluster me with your handsomeness.
You're creepy.
Then why is your chest getting all flushed?
It's a rash.
I'm allergic to beans.
Look, do you even go to school here?
Sorry, I get paid to
shoot paintballs, honey.
Not the breeze.
Lame.
I'll hit you in the foot.
Thank you.
You're dry, sugar.
I'll save you for last.
You won't get the chance.
You okay?
I got a better look at him.
He's not that good-looking.
Didn't he shoot you?
He tried.
He's a bad shot, too?
Man, what does this guy have going for him?
Pierce loaded your gun with blanks.
Don't--don't--don't shoot!
Why does this keep happening?
And what kind of Ice Cream company does this?
Where's the paintball stuff from last year?
I hid it
so the school doesn't get destroyed again.
Too late.
Oh, hi, Jeff.
We just ran into the black rider.
Dean, if you want this game to end,
we need firepower.
In there.
The key's in my shorts.
I can get it out, I guess.
Now, this is more like it.
Okay, black rider.
Now let's see who's attractive.
Dude, you have a problem.
Oh, nice.
Whoa, where you going?
To have a conversation with Pierce.
She's pretty awesome today.
What happened?
Black rider.
He wiped out the whole fort.
Then why are you still here?
I can't go back out there.
This is the only life I know.
Annie?
Is that you?
D'you get the ammo?
Yep.
Annie! What are you doing?
Why was Jeff's gun loaded with blanks?
Was it?
Agh! Okay, okay, okay!
Oh, coming out.
Oh, okay.
I get it.
So once again, I'm the bad guy.
Yes.
Well, he got to win last year.
It's a game, Annie. It's j--
Fine.
It's a game.
Let's play.
Put it in your holster.
Come on, Annie.
You're my favorite. I don't wanna beat you.
It's just that I don't want Jeff to be--
Put the gun in your holster,
and let's play the game.
Right.
So you can shoot me and play without me.
That's this group's favorite thing.
We're always nice to you, Pierce.
Wrong.
Wrong!
Three days ago, I walked in on you guys
playing cards without me.
Three days ago!
We weren't playing cards.
We were voting, and you weren't invited
Because we were voting about you.
What?
We were taking a vote...
on whether we'd invite you back to the group next year.
Lucky for you, it had to be unanimous.
There was one holdout.
One red card.
Pick it up.
Black rider...
It's Jeff Winger.
I know you've heard of me by now.
No.
He's lying.
Look, if you're half the cool cowboy
you pretend to be,
You'll respect that we've got
a situation playing out here
And let us be until it's settled.
Sure thing.
And once it's settled...
I'm taking out everybody in this room.
Starting with you, Mr. Insecure.
You think you're good-looking, but you're not.
You're average.
You're just an average-looking guy
with a big chin.
What's going on?
He's faking it.
No, something's wrong with him.
No, no, it's fake.
Last week he did it
to get out of letting me have a stick of gum.
He's old, though. Could be real.
It's real. It is.
The gurgling's a nice touch.
You guys are terrible people.
Ah, we warned you.
Buddy, are you all right?
You want me to call 911?
Sucker!
Wait, seriously?
Told you, dude.
I'm the best!
You're the worst.
I'm out of the group?
You're out of mine!
And I'm winning!
We've created a monster.
Let's not give ourselves too much credit.
I'm out.
Some old guy pretended to have a heart attack.
Shot me in the gut.
I don't care. That's your problem.
This school sucks.
Well, then why do you go here?
I wouldn't go to this toilet
with my big sister's toe.
I take a class online.
I was paid to be here and win the game
so my boss could keep his prize money.
You work for the ice cream company?
Sweetie, this thing is so much bigger
than you can even imagine.
I'm outta here.
I got coldplay tickets.
Coldplay?
Too late, bean allergy.
You blew it.
Hello?
Anybody?
Does anyone have an alliance I can join?
I'm really loyal.
Am I out?
On your knees.
No Greendale student can be allowed
to win this game.
Initiate plan b: operation total invasion.
There's some more community coming up right now.
Think it as extra credit.
Greendale students.
I understand you've unified
and intend to draw this game out.
Well, if it was a war you want, it's a war you shall lose.
Resistance is as pointless as your degrees.
Are we the little rascals?
I was.
I'm on your team. Stop shooting me.
We're gonna lose the war and this school.
Looks like this is it.
We're dying out here.
I had a dream it would end this way.
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.
Then I guess I'll see you in hell.
