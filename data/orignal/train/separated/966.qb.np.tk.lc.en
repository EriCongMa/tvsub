can we start over ?
it was a suprising day for the women of wisteria lane .
well , i was wonder if you might have dinner with me .
ok
he &apos;s giving her orgasms ? no , not deliberately
i can see we are going to be great friends
you &apos;re a vibrant , attractive women. you
who hasn &apos;t had sex in two years .
that sounds grandma to me .
let me come stay with you when i get out of here .
this guy thinked i am on a commition ,
i want to keep it that way .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you have been anxious all night .
i think i let the freezer door of scavo &apos;s open .
but it was even a more suprising night .
crap ! it &apos;s my dad .
for the scavos
where is she ?
don &apos;t. she &apos;s wearing anything , all right
who is she ?
just some girl in my class .
i go to the bathroom ,
you get 60 seconds to get her out of here .
there is a slight misunderstanding
in the scavo house that night .
you see , someone in the family was having an affair ,
with a married woman .
and lynette scavo suspected her husband .
false alarm. the freezer was shut tight .
unfortunately for lynette , she was wrong .
liar .
what ?
i always knew thing could change between us , tom
but no matter what ,
the one thing i always thought i &apos;d get is your respect .
lynette , what &apos;s going on ?
i followed you to the warehouse . i know everything .
oh , boy .
yeah , at this point ,
i think i &apos;m gonna need a little bit more than that .
you &apos;re right . i shouldn &apos;t have kept this from you .
and ...
for what it &apos;s worth , i wanted to bring you in on it .
but i was afraid you &apos;d overreact .
that &apos;s what you were afraid of ?
hey , i &apos;m upset , too .
but let &apos;s face it. boys will be boys .
i think ... i have to sit down now .
lynette , are you really surprised ?
it &apos;s not the first time this has happened .
and it definitely won &apos;t be the last .
you know what ? i have to kill you now .
well , he &apos;s your son , too .
who ?
porter !
what are you talking about ?
i found out porter &apos;s been hooking up a girl at warehouse
what are you talking about ?
and just like that ,
the slight misunderstanding in the scavo house had ended
hey. what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re having sex with your best friend &apos;s mother ? !
and a huge family crisis
had begun .
desire , it &apos;s an emotion designed to lead us astray ,
causing us to buy things we can &apos;t afford ...
encouraging us to sample desserts
we don &apos;t need ...
and pushing us into love affairs
we &apos;re clearly not ready for .
i want you to call that woman
and tell her you are never seeing her again .
her name is anne .
her name is mrs. schilling .
she was your t @-@ ball coach when you were 6 .
by the way , does your best friend know
you &apos;re sleeping with his mother ?
we &apos;re keeping our relationship from kirby for now .
this isn &apos;t a relationship .
you are being used by this woman .
no , i &apos;m not . i love her .
okay , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m calling her .
no .
hey ! what if her husband answers ?
gee , porter .
that &apos;s just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman .
listen to me ! mr. schilling can &apos;t find out .
he--he &apos;s totally violent. he--he would kill her .
well , then you have put her in a very dangerous position ,
haven &apos;t you ?
okay . i &apos;ll call her . i &apos;ll tell her it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m not going to say that you know .
that &apos;ll just freak her out. but you have to promise me
that you won &apos;t say anything to her psycho husband .
i am not promising anything .
so help me , if i find out
that you do something , and she gets hurt ,
i will leave this house and i will never come back !
oh , please ! you would never do that .
yeah ? well , i @-@ i &apos;ve done a lot of things
you never thought i would do .
wait .
we won &apos;t say anything .
but if you don &apos;t end this , you won &apos;t have to leave .
we will throw you out .
so ... you wanted to see me ?
sit .
tell us , charlie ...
have you enjoyed working here at mrs. van de kamp &apos;s ?
yeah. it &apos;s great .
you don &apos;t feel you &apos;ve been underpaid ?
no .
well , then perhaps you can explain
why you stole $ 200 from the petty cash box yesterday .
what ? i didn &apos;t steal anything .
charlie , we don &apos;t accuse you unless we &apos;d concrete evidence
and thanks to my diligent partner here , we do .
so am i , like ... fired ?
you &apos;re more than &quot; like &quot; fired .
you &apos;re fired. and , of course , we want our money back .
uh , i don &apos;t have have it . i spent it .
well , then i suggest you return your purchase .
do you have a receipt ?
yeah. yeah , like pot dealers give receipts .
well , you &apos;ve just covered yourself in glory on this one .
just ... please , don &apos;t tell my parents .
i &apos;ll get you the money . i promise .
can you believe it ? a thief and a pothead !
well , at least we know now
where the 2 pounds of cookie dough went .
too many ?
yeah . i gotta have one more. ah !
thank you for doing this .
ah , well ... we needed to wipe the slate clean , right ?
and honestly
this is the best second first date i &apos;ve ever had .
isn &apos;t it ?
and knowing we &apos;re not gonna have sex
takes all the pressure off .
that &apos;s ... something we know ?
yes .
we &apos;re starting completely over ,
so this time , we &apos;re gonna do things right .
w @-@ which means what ?
well , it means ...
no sex until at least date four .
ah . i want us to spend this time
really getting to know each other .
i @-@ i do know you .
what &apos;s my least favorite word ?
&quot; phlegm . &quot;
you &apos;re just guessing .
it &apos;s &quot; panties . &quot;
ohh. although some days it &apos;s &quot; larva &quot; or &quot; chunks . &quot;
well , i will try to remember that .
mm. now you tell me something i don &apos;t know about you .
okay .
i &apos;m a painter .
i sort of guessed that when you painted my house .
i mean , i paint ...
like ... on a canvas , in a frame .
seriously ?
i went to art school in paris .
and my professor had a beret , so you know he was good .
so now you &apos;re painting ... my bathroom ?
yeah .
it sucks .
but i &apos;ve been blocked for the past year .
blocked ?
yeah .
i mean , i keep trying to start new pieces , but ...
nothing comes. it &apos;s ... driving me crazy .
well , i &apos;m sorry things aren &apos;t going well .
but i &apos;m glad you told me .
see ? we &apos;re getting to know each other .
and we wouldn &apos;t have if we &apos;d spent the whole night in bed .
yeah .
and now i &apos;m creatively and sexually frustrated .
first dates are awesome .
jeez , roberta , i know you hate to throw anything away ,
but do you have the garbagemen bringing you stuff now ?
pardon my french , but what &apos;s french for &quot; kiss my ass &quot; ?
so you said dave has a secret .
now how you gettin &apos; that from this ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of phone numbers .
yeah , it may be just a bunch of numbers to you ,
but to a savvy sleuth with a keen eye of a bloodhound
yeah , yeah , you &apos;re miss marple with a bum liver .
so what &apos;s he hiding ?
let me walk you through it . around the 1st of every month ,
dave gets a string of calls-- five or six--
from this number in boston .
they &apos;re all short-- 10 , 15 seconds .
my guess is he &apos;s not picking up .
somebody &apos;s leaving him messages .
you know , bugging him .
once a month , huh ?
my guess is it &apos;s an ex @-@ wife looking for her alimony .
except it &apos;s not . you see this ?
after a few days , he always calls back .
and who , you ask , is he calling ?
a hospital in boston .
it &apos;s the office of dr.samuel heller ...
psychiatrist .
so ... once a month ,
dave whines about his life
to a beantown headshrinker , huh ?
big whoop .
i looked up your davey &apos;s doc on the web .
he &apos;s not your garden @-@ variety shrink .
he &apos;s a renowned psychiatrist and published author
with a very specialized field of expertise .
and that , my dear watson ,
is your neighbor &apos;s little secret .
oh , lap of luxury ,
how i &apos;ve missed sitting in you .
celia ! juanita !
chef is taking fresh @-@ baked cookies out of the oven .
you &apos;re not gonna catch me !
oh , i can &apos;t tell you how nice it is
to hear the sound of children &apos;s laughter in this house .
you know what i was thinking ?
why don &apos;t you all stay the weekend ?
ooh , we &apos;d love to .
jeez , we can &apos;t .
why not ?
celia &apos;s birthday party is sunday .
we &apos;ve gotta get ready for it , remember ?
what &apos;s to get ready ? you buy a $ 9 sheet cake
and fling a pita over a tree and bam ! party time .
but i don &apos;t have a change of clothes .
my nephew left a whole closet full of old clothes .
i &apos;m sure something will fit you .
carlos , just nod your head ,
&apos;cause i ain &apos;t leaving this pool .
oh , good. it &apos;s settled .
oh , gaby. your margarita &apos;s getting low .
i &apos;ll send brandon out with a fresh one .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
you heard the woman. she wants children &apos;s laughter .
and i want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner .
it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
i just don &apos;t feel comfortable with this .
why not ?
i mean , look at this place. it &apos;s like shangri @-@ la .
wow , you &apos;re right. the pitch black i see here
is much more dazzling than the one at home .
what is your problem ?
my problem is that it &apos;s a bad idea
to mix business and pleasure .
says the man who massaged her into an orgasm .
even more reason to keep some professional distance .
carlos , she is just a lonely old woman
yearning for some friendship and human contact .
and i , for one , am happy to be that human .
mrs.solis ? your margarita .
oh , shoot . i can &apos;t reach it .
hey , guys . sorry i &apos;m late .
hey. you bring beer ?
was i supposed to ?
no , tom was supposed to .
gosh. sorry . i thought the two cases i bought monday
would &apos;ve lasted more than one rehearsal .
boys , we &apos;re better off not drinking today .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work to do and only one week to do it .
what are you talking about ?
we are playing battle of the bands at the white horse !
uh , dave ? battle of the bands isn &apos;t for amateurs .
you gotta audition .
uh , we don &apos;t .
eddie &apos;s got estate buddy whose husband owns the club .
you &apos;re kidding. we &apos;re playing an actual gig ?
in front of people who aren &apos;t listening
just because i pay their allowance ?
well , this is fantastic !
yes ! but that means the pressure &apos;s on .
we gotta really rehearse our cover stuff
and ... we need an original song .
i don &apos;t know anything about songwriting .
i @-@ i know a little bit .
no , you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s fine . mike and i will write something .
you got a little time later ?
not tonight . i got plans .
&quot; plans &quot; ?
what &apos;s her name ?
can we just rehearse , please ?
you know , i heard that susan and jackson broke up .
i heard they got back together .
it &apos;s not susan . stop guessing .
also , get lives .
whatever , mike ,
just so long as you &apos;re having fun .
hey ! who said you-- turn the board around .
get back here .
no ! come out here and show me some moves !
sorry to bother you .
just wanted to see if you needed anything before i go off to bed .
no , we &apos;re good .
sure you don &apos;t want to order margarita number 12 ?
you sure you don &apos;t want to shut your piehole ?
it &apos;s so cute , how you two bicker .
carlos , how do those pajamas fit you ?
they &apos;re perfect .
i @-@ i hope your nephew doesn &apos;t mind that i was wearing &apos; em .
he &apos;ll never know. we &apos;re estranged .
oh. okay .
anyway , we &apos;re good. so have a nice night .
oh ! what &apos;s that ?
some animated thing .
i love animated movies .
the girls wanted to watch it ,
so we &apos;re kind of having a family movie night .
ooh , that sounds like fun !
my heavens , is that penguin surfing ?
gee , i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t really see the screen anymore .
oh , dear . i &apos;m being rude .
oh , that &apos;s okay .
there. that &apos;s better .
did she just crawl under ...
oh , yeah .
and so there i was in ninth grade ,
and my boobs had not made an appearance .
i was desperate .
here . let me refill that for you .
and so that &apos;s when i got caught stuffing
at the pep rally .
and six months later ... kaboom .
i was voted prom queen. nice work , girls .
stop that right now .
what ?
the sex music. turn it off .
that--that &apos;s not sex music .
we are not having sex until date number four ,
and this is date number two .
i know what it is .
it--it &apos;s just that you look so hot in these pants ,
smells so good .
and your eyes ...
look , i made you dinner. come on .
jackson
i braised beef for you .
do you know what a pain in the ass it is to braise meat ?
okay , do you know how sad it makes me
to know that you only braised it to boink me ?
you &apos;re supposed to be asking me questions .
the point of all this was to get to know each other better .
how is it gonna make our relationship stronger
for me to know that in the fifth grade ,
they sent you to the therapist
&apos;cause you wouldn &apos;t stop chewing your hair ?
you know , that was hard for me to share ,
and the fact that you just make light of it ...
no , i &apos;m am calling the second date officially over .
and you know what ?
i was going to let you feel me up over my blouse .
but now ? nada .
so before we wrap up here ,
we still need some chaperones for the junior prom .
anne schilling is coordinating the volunteers ,
and she could really use some help .
nobody ?
i know we &apos;re all busy ,
but this is important .
we want our kids to have fun , but let &apos;s face it .
if we don &apos;t keep an eye on them ,
god only knows what kind of trouble they &apos;ll get into .
helen ?
marjorie ? you &apos;ll help ?
fantastic. thanks , guys .
hey , lynette .
do these meetings keep getting longer ,
or do they just seem that way ?
i don &apos;t know .
so ...
how &apos;s the family ?
i haven &apos;t seen penny in so long ,
and all the kids are getting so big now .
i guess the boys will be going off to college soon .
aah ! lynette !
i know everything , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , but ...
it &apos;s important for you to understand ...
i love porter .
so do i .
and if you ever lay a hand on him again ,
you will find out just how much .
oh , bree . i &apos;ve got good news .
me , too. you go first .
i hired a girl to replace that thief charlie .
oh. well , are you sure she &apos;s trustworthy ?
well , she comes with a strong recommendation
from the head of the local f.b.i. office--
her father , who &apos;s mormon .
well done , orson !
thank you. your turn .
&quot; the new christian reader &quot; just published
an advance review of my cookbook. listen !
&quot; mrs. van de kamp &apos;s colorful stories of her upbringing
&quot; show her upstanding values ,
but her recipes are sinfully delicious . &quot;
they gave me four halos !
then i think this is appropriate
holy cow !
i have to admit ,
i had some reservations about us working together ,
but this is succeed beyond my wildest dreams .
we &apos;re quite a team , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah , and the best part is
we get to see each other all the time .
mm @-@ hmm , i know , which makes the hardest part
keeping my hands off you all the time .
orson !

this kitchen is the birthplace of our triumphs .
what better place to celebrate them , hmm ?
ooh ! oh , this counter &apos;s hard on my head .

i &apos;m making a castle .
it &apos;s stupid .
no , you &apos;re stupid !
you &apos;re both stupid. stop it !
um , mrs. hildebrand , this is really nice of you .
but why would you want to ruin your beautiful room ?
oh , it &apos;s not my room anymore. it &apos;s their room .
what ?
yes. it &apos;s the room they &apos;ll be staying in
whenever you come to visit .
they &apos;re getting a new tv , bunk beds .

we &apos;re not going to europe with grandma nutjob .
i &apos;m not walking away from $ 100,000 .

that you try to shake off before anybody can see it .
i can &apos;t believe i ever thought you didn &apos;t know me .
well , i guess i should let you finish this .
i &apos;m sort of missing hands .
actually , that is one detail i could use some help with .
really ?
unless you have a problem posing naked .
oh. come on .
i think you know the answer to that .
hi .
hello , katherine .
um , i thought you might want this videotape ...
from our surveillance camera .
we have a surveillance camera ?
yes , in the , uh , test kitchen .
oh , my god .
so that means you saw me and ...
mike. yes , indeedy .
oh , i &apos;m so embarrassed !
oh , what you must think of me !
let &apos;s not dwell on it .
i mean , having sex in the kitchen ,
where food &apos;s prepared ...
what kind of a demented slut would do that ?
i said ... let &apos;s not dwell on it .
thanks for bringing it by .
katherine , i &apos;m sorry , but i just have to ask--
are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
meaning what
meaning susan is your oldest friend on this street .
she divorced him , bree , and she &apos;s seeing someone else .
why can &apos;t mike do that ?
because she &apos;s your friend , and we &apos;re women .
we don &apos;t do that to each other .
look ...
i &apos;ve been alone for five years .
i &apos;m finally in a relationship ,
and you &apos;re trying to make me feel guilty ?
is that what i saw on the tape a relationship ?
i don &apos;t know what it is .
all i know is ...
i &apos;m having the time of my life .
fair enough. but just be careful ,
i mean , this is very complicated .
i &apos;d hate to see it end badly .
hey , breakfast &apos;s on the table .
porter , this whole hating me thing
that you &apos;ve got going on right now
believe it or not , i get where you &apos;re coming from .
i don &apos;t hate you .
but one day ,
you are gonna meet someone more ...
appropriate .
someone who want the same things that you do out of life .
then you are gonna know what real love is .
and when you do , i hope you will finally see
where i am coming from .
yeah ?
it &apos;s me. can you talk ?
hey , gary . i &apos;m running kind of late. can i call you later ?
just listen .
i can leave town saturday .
you have the money , right ?
yeah. no problem .
i love you .
i know where you &apos;re coming from , mom .
and ...
i @-@ i want you and dad to know
that i really appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me .
good .
i &apos;ll see you downstairs .
desire--
it &apos;s an emotion designed to lead us astray ,
persuading those who crave love to make foolish choices ...
causing those who yearn for family
to act out in anger ...
allowing those who are lonely ...
to behave in reckless ways .
and when the pursuit of our heart &apos;s desire
becomes an obsession ,
the best we can hope for
is a caring friend willing to come along ...
hi . i &apos;d like to book the next flight to fairview .
and stop us .
