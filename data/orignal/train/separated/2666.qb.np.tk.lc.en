is that alcohol on your breath ?
hey , how &apos;s the boy ?
how am i ? i got dust up the crack of my ass , and i &apos;m starving to death .
you &apos;re doing an excellent job . take pleasure in that .
he &apos;s been ragging in my ear all day . i &apos;d like to kill him . hear that , prick ?
get him out of here . just get him the hell out of here .
is there a problem ?
you made your point .
i made my point .
you made your point .
what point ?
enough with work stoppage .
this union safety official
stays until he deems this place is free of hazard .
i have the money .
you do ?
christopher , see if he &apos;s paid up his union dues ...
... then pop a wheel cover to check the brakes .
i &apos;ll get right on it .
i &apos;ll get your money , okay ?
we shall return .
halle @-@ fucking @-@ lujah !
give me your cell . i gotta call carmela .
you sure it was them ?
they were drunk in gym class . byron barber vomited all over the teacher .
i spat it out .
anthony . you &apos;re gonna lie to me now ?
he &apos;s sorry , father hagy . he &apos;ll be sorrier when he gets home .
anthony , why don &apos;t you wait outside ?
he &apos;s suspended for three days .
let me pay for the wine .
this isn &apos;t just a crime against property ...
... it &apos;s an affront to our holy sacristy .
i &apos;ve asked dr. galani , our school psychologist , to join us .
he &apos;s been keeping an eye on anthony . meeting with his teachers .
why don &apos;t you pick it up from there , doctor ?
in many respects , anthony is a normal , healthy 8th @-@ grader .
sister patricia , his art teacher ...
... thinks he shows strong skills in spatial orientation .
but the thing is , and it &apos;s not just this one incident ...
... anthony sometimes has trouble following the rules ...
... weighing consequences .
at times , doesn &apos;t think before he acts .
and ...
... it &apos;s thought that there &apos;s a good possibility anthony could be add .
add ?
attention deficit disorder .
i knew it .
i knew there was something .
what is it ?
it &apos;s an aggregate of symptoms .
inattention , impulsivity ...
... sometimes , although not always , hyperactivity .
to be sure , we &apos;ll give him a thorough evaluation .
he needs a whack upside the head .
if he &apos;s got an illness ? it &apos;s an illness , right ?
you &apos;d hit somebody who &apos;s sick ? you &apos;d hit somebody with polio ?
you hit anthony ?
nobody gets hit in our house . not exactly my idea .
what &apos;s happening if you can &apos;t do a little tarantella on the kids ...
... when they step out of line ?
so what happens now ?
he &apos;ll be given a complete battery of testing .
psychological , behavioral , medical .
let me ask you a question .
these other kids , you keeping an eye on them ?
are you testing them ? the ones that aren &apos;t named soprano ?
there &apos;s no immediate plans for that .
we attend to every child at verbum dei according to his own circumstances .
and so what do we , as the parents , do ?
nothing ?
oh , no , i mean , anthony &apos;s misbehaved . he should be consequenced .
it &apos;s a crime !
to suspend that child from school with all the money you give them ?
that gym teacher shit a brick
when your friend puked on his boots , huh , anthony ?
want to encourage him ?
whatever happened to &quot; boys will be boys &quot; ?
he stole from the church . they don &apos;t make them any lower .
what a loser .
that &apos;s enough out of you .
oh , his father was the same way .
i practically lived in that vice principal &apos;s office .
could we not , please ?
you only remember what you want to remember .
yeah , well , i must &apos;ve had another son ...
... who stole a car when he was 10 years old .
he could barely see over the wheel .
he was a hellion . him and his little crew ...
... they stole lobsters on the boats ...
... and sold them for a buck on bloomfield avenue .
really ?
how many times must i say it ? i don &apos;t want that talk in front of him .
that is wrong , and i don &apos;t condone it !
yeah . sure .
who are you yelling at ?
what ?
you stupe .
what did you say ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
what &apos;s he doing now ? what &apos;s going on ?
he yells at me--
anthony .
i thought this could wait till after dinner ,
but your father and i have talked .
you are not to play mario cart or go skateboarding for three weeks .
and no tv .
you won &apos;t sit on that internet .
and every day , you &apos;ll ride your bike to go visit grandma .
oh , that &apos;ll be nice .
it &apos;s not fair !
some fucking day , huh ?
i feel like a bomb went off .
you know that stuff the doctor said ? i never saw any of that in anthony .
you never notice how he picks at the tongue of his shoe ?
like he can &apos;t help himself .
if he even has this thing .
something &apos;s going on .
carm ?
yep ?
do you think he knows ?
i don &apos;t know .
she knows .
are you-- ?
really ?
what makes you say that ?
are you in-- ?
i don &apos;t know . things she says . she makes remarks , like this today with him .
are you in the mafia ?
she talk to you about me ?
talk ? to me ?
something happen on that college trip ?
happen ?
like what ?
i don &apos;t know , she seemed peculiar when she got back .
i think pretty soon we &apos;re gonna have to , you know ...
... talk to her about the business .
yeah . the two of us should sit down with meadow .
talk as a family .
with him , they &apos;ll test him and we &apos;ll see what &apos;s what .
right ?
good night .
good night .
maybe i don &apos;t want to admit something &apos;s wrong with my kid ...
... but this sounds like bullshit .
what do you mean ?
if he &apos;s got a disease , why punish him ?
isn &apos;t that bullshit ?
add is a controversial subject .
is it a disease , or a way for psychologists to line their pockets ?
many children can really benefit by professional intervention .
he got in trouble .
so you don &apos;t consider his behavior out of the norm ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
what do i know about it ?
what do you mean ?
oh , i gotta spell it out for you ?
do you see his behavior as a reflection of your own ?
look , like i said , maybe i don &apos;t want to admit there &apos;s something wrong ...
... but if he &apos;s got this thing ...
... we &apos;ll deal with it .
if he had polio , we &apos;d deal with it .
you pick up the pieces and you go on from there .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
do you want to say anything else about this ?
well , last time you were telling me that you had intimate feelings for me .
but you &apos;ve not mentioned it .
intimate feelings ?
i think i said i was in love .
how are you doing with it ?
i can &apos;t turn off my feelings because you say it &apos;s a byproduct of therapy .
i never said to turn off your feelings .
well , i already got a girlfriend .
she &apos;s russian , 24 .
how old are you ?
it &apos;s interesting it took you so long to tell me you had a girlfriend .
how are you doing with it ?
i gotta ask you one more question about my son .
you think i should go easy on him now ...
... or press him harder ?
that &apos;s difficult to say .
what , you want a raise , maybe , to figure this out ?
anthony ! anthony jr . , you get up !
why ? i don &apos;t have to go to school . i &apos;m suspended .
you aren &apos;t lying around in bed all day . we &apos;re not running a hotel over here .
get up , have some breakfast !
i don &apos;t want any . i &apos;m not hungry .
what you are gonna do today is get up and go rake .
then pull all of those leaves out of the pool filter .
you &apos;re gonna do some work around here .
mom , where &apos;s my gray jacket ?
i left it downstairs . what &apos;d you do with it ?
hello ?
anthony jr . , turn off that music ! your father is sleeping !
you said i couldn &apos;t watch tv or play nintendo .

... you walk through the colored neighborhood .
junior ! big fancy car .
we &apos;re going to my sister &apos;s , and you promised to--
nonstop ! don &apos;t you get sick of yourself ?
dad , could you and uncle jun give me a ride to school ?
not now , tony . you be good , though .
pay attention to what those teachers tell you .
see you , ma .
okay . be good .
hey , wait up !
shit !
hey , rocco !
come on , move , move , guys ! move , move !
hey , john , one more day , man ! one more day .
there &apos;s gonna be a huge payoff . -i &apos;m gonna kill you !
what do you got ?
what the fuck is this ? what the fuck are you bringing me here ?
who are you fucking with , rocco ?
fuck you ! -motherfucker !
you asshole !
what are you bringing to me here ?
piece of shit !
what the fucking-- ?
christ !
you &apos;re up .
who the fuck can sleep with all this shit going on ?
i thought about jefferson airplane this morning . how about that ?
1967 .
made me think of my father .
what about him ?
first time i saw him whack the shit out of somebody .
what made you think about that ?
something to do with my son , i think , what &apos;s been going on .
why did your father whack the shit out of some guy ?
i never saw him do something like that .
he used to whack us kids around a little .
really ?
yeah , the belt was his favorite child development tool .
this was different .
you could tell he knew what he was doing .
how did you feel about your father after that ?
i didn &apos;t want him to do it to me .
seriously .
what should i say ? i was glad he wasn &apos;t a fag .
how did you and your father get along ?
good .
he was a good guy , my father . everybody liked him .
he knew how to have a good time .
he loved shellfish , clams , oysters .
taught us how to eat them .
put some worcestershire on , suck them down .
it &apos;s good .
my mother never ate anything raw .
but he wasn &apos;t around much .
what did he do for a living ?
retail meat and provisions .
and a little numbers , extortion , loan @-@ sharking .
how did you feel about that ?
how did i feel ?
about your father ...
... being engaged in illegal activities ?
you know , i never really knew about it .
when did you find out ?
who remembers ?
you thought of that incident this morning .
are you concerned that your son is going to find out about you ?
don &apos;t talk to me about legitimate business .
what about chemical companies ?
dumping that shit into rivers and they got deformed babies popping up all over .
does he know anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
has he asked you ?
no .
how will you handle that ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you ever talk to your father about it ?
are you kidding ?
no kidding , tony . that doesn &apos;t sound like anthony .
yesterday , he &apos;s a boy . today , i worry about him .
teenagers .
my daughter gives me feminist shit about this place .
how it &quot; objectifies women . &quot; shit like that .
these girls pull down 1500 a week .
this bears no weight with the principessa .
meadow was one thing , but this is my son .
boys are different from girls .
pussy , kevin and matt , they ever ask you about this thing of ours ?
i lied through my teeth , but they knew . fucking nitwits .
they love me anyway .
it &apos;s hard to raise kids in an information age .
you know , to protect them .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
who &apos;s got an anniversary or a special occasion ?
what are these , antiques ?
i was picking up the chinaman &apos;s vig ,
and the fedex van was wide open .
the guy went in for a burger .
no shit , fedex . they &apos;re usually pretty careful with those .
you did this in daylight ?
nobody saw me .
that &apos;s interstate commerce .
you want to be in prison for a stunt like that , be my guest .
i &apos;d take a licking but keep on ticking .
i &apos;m getting out of here .
jesus christ !
what &apos;s with his ass ?
he &apos;s got a lot on his mind .
what do you think is going on in this one , anthony ?
i don &apos;t know . how many more are left ?
the quicker you answer , the faster we &apos;ll be done .
whatever pops in your mind .
there &apos;s no guy ?
okay , good . where do you think he is ?
out buying food for the horse ?
anything else ?
watching tv , maybe ?
maybe he &apos;s watching south park . number one &apos;s on tonight .
aliens abduct cartman
and they give him an anal probe and it makes him fart fire .
you &apos;re home .
you know , if it &apos;s bad , the add , they put anthony in special ed .
the doctors say that ?
doctors don &apos;t know anything yet . they started testing today .
i picked up these books at the mall .
help me to help my child ?
listen to this .
&quot; about 50 % of children diagnosed with add ...
... receive help from special education teachers . &quot;
we don &apos;t even know that &apos;s what he &apos;s got .
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s just be ignorant . why worry about anything now ?
you blame me , don &apos;t you ?
who said anything about that ?
no , go ahead . you blame me .
i blame myself .
for what ?
for what .
for staying with me ?
i have two eyes .
who do we blame our daughter on ?
straight @-@ a student , national honor society , featured soloist in the choir .
yeah , this isn &apos;t going anywhere .
&quot; like father , like son , &quot; right ? what about &quot; daddy &apos;s little girl &quot; ?
my son &apos;s got your uncle lenny in his gene pool .
do i blame you for that ?
if it helps you .
hi , grandma .
well , look who &apos;s here .
oh , look at that little face .
pearl , meet my grandson .
this is your grandson ?
he rode his bike all the way over to visit his grandma .
how do you like that ?
how come he &apos;s not in school ?
because he was a bad boy !
yes , he was , that &apos;s why .
he &apos;s a big one !
she had a stroke .
now half her brain is gone .
so what shall we do ? what shall we do ?
let &apos;s see .
let &apos;s play scrabble .
you &apos;d be surprised how good your grandmother is .
i don &apos;t think so , gram . i &apos;m kind of wiped .
oh , you &apos;re a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy . you &apos;re too young to be so tired .
they sent me to a psychiatrist all morning . i took a million tests .
a psychiatrist ?
you know , because i got suspended and everything .
they sent you to a psychiatrist ?
but that &apos;s crazy . that &apos;s all nonsense .
that &apos;s nothing but a racket for the jews !
dad goes .
he does not .
yes , he does .
he does not .
yes , he does .
to a psychiatrist ?
he does not .
he does too .
why do you say that ? that &apos;s ridiculous !
i heard him and mom talking about it .
what does he need a psychiatrist for ?
is it okay if i take that pear , grandma ?
he goes to talk about his mother . that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing .
he talks about me , he complains .
&quot; she didn &apos;t do this , she did that . &quot;
oh , i gave my life to my children on a silver platter .
and this is how he repays me .
dad , what &apos;s that noise ?
noise ?
it &apos;s a flat tire .
i asked you to clean the nails from the driveway .
i was praying for something like this .
i spent too much money on braces for two years ...
... not to take you to the dentist now .
maybe we should call the auto club .
we change tires at our house . watch and learn .
yesterday , with the psychologist , how &apos;d that go ?
okay .
yeah ? what &apos;d you guys do ?
he made me look at pictures . and then i had to say something about them .
did you talk about anything interesting ?
that &apos;s kind of between me and my therapist .
he said i don &apos;t have to say anything if i didn &apos;t want to .
that &apos;s what we pay extra for at that school ?
the other night at dinner , you made a remark .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yeah , you did .
i &apos;m not mad . i just need to know what you meant by it .
i didn &apos;t mean anything .
come on .
kids at school said some stuff .
what &apos;d they say ?
that you were in the mafia .
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
the guys at uncle jackie &apos;s funeral .
and those other guys writing license plates and taking pictures .
those were feds , right ? like in godfather i.
uncle jackie &apos;s funeral . right .
i found this page with uncle jackie on the web .
it said he ran some union that ripped off these pension things or something .
uncle jackie was a complicated man .
but you loved him , right ?
yeah .
you didn &apos;t see me on the web , did you ?
no .
that &apos;s right .
give me a hand so we can get the algae scraped off your teeth .
i &apos;m going crazy with this shit , what he knows , what he doesn &apos;t know .
he &apos;ll find out eventually . what &apos;s the difference ?
me , my father . it &apos;s probably in the genes , right ?
you know , this add thing .
it &apos;s probably genetical .
what about pussy ?
he &apos;s an acquaintance of mine .
this guy is a stone gangster , and he &apos;s got three kids .
one graduated , and two are going to villanova .
how do you account for that ?
then you got leopold and loeb .
they murdered this kid for fun ...
... and their father was a successful businessman .
do you hold your father responsible for what you &apos;ve become ?
sometimes i think about what life would &apos;ve been like ...
... if my father hadn &apos;t gotten mixed up in what he got mixed up in .
how life would &apos;ve been different .
maybe i &apos;d be selling patio furniture in san diego .
we talked last time about how you felt when you became aware ...
... of your father &apos;s criminal life . any more thoughts on that ?
when you first started therapy , you said you had this dream ...
... about those ducks .
they flew away with your penis . it was a bad omen ...
... that something was going to happen in your family .
is this the terrible thing ?
look , if you know something , please , quit fucking around .
i think it &apos;s important to remember .
you said you liked the history channel .
he who doesn &apos;t understand history is doomed to repeat it .
let &apos;s talk about your father .
my father .
heads up !
why are you smiling ?
just thinking about my uncle .
he used to throw the ball with me .
the one with whom you have all the static ?
uncle jun.
he was always practicing his curve ball outside in front of the house .
i was probably about 8 or 9 .
then my sister came out .
the one who lives in california ?
janice .
how does she feel about your parents ?
who cares what she thinks ? she calls herself vishnamantha .
soprano isn &apos;t good enough for her . wannabe dot @-@ head .
why were you thinking of your uncle ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting in the car .
why ? where are you going ?
someplace .
where are you going ? can i come ?
your mom wants you to get the screens down to the basement .
no , i want to go with you guys .
he said no .
janice ...
... you both won &apos;t be going , you talk to your brother like that .
go on .
my mother was inside , cooking the meat for the gravy , you know , the &quot; red lead . &quot;
pork bones and veal . it was a sunday .
but you said--
i said we &apos;d see .
what &apos;s the matter with her ? she won &apos;t eat .
you won &apos;t have to get me anything for christmas ...
... or tell me to take the trash out .
i shouldn &apos;t have to tell you to take the trash out .
why can &apos;t i have this ? it isn &apos;t fair !
i don &apos;t want to hear about that stupid electric organ !
it &apos;s not stupid , it &apos;s fun .
enough ! he won &apos;t give me a moment &apos;s peace .
if janice wanted it , she &apos;d get it .
she always gets what she wants .
where were they going ? why couldn &apos;t i go ?
your sister does as she &apos;s told .
right , i forgot .
janice never does anything wrong . she &apos;s just perfect .
you &apos;re driving me crazy !
no , i &apos;m not .
she said what ?
she was high @-@ strung , very dramatic .
every night to her is a night at the opera .
i could stick this fork in your eye !
she wasn &apos;t gonna do it .
holy shit , that &apos;s why i &apos;m remembering all this .
on account of where they were going .
where were they going ?
i found out a couple sundays later .
the toll now stands at 11 dead and 600 wounded ...
... as well as hundreds of businesses ....
mom , i &apos;m going to the cyo to play ball .
take a bat with you , what they &apos;re doing on springfield avenue .
-looting and sniper fire along springfield avenue continue ...
... with mayor hugh addonizio placing blame on outside agitators--
come on , dad , let &apos;s go !
i &apos;m coming , i &apos;m coming .
keep your sticky fingers off the car . i just waxed the damn thing .
can i steer ?
maybe on the way home , honey .
here we are .
come on .
uncle jun ?
buy something nice .
my heart was broken .
you felt your father was showing favoritism .
i still remember that feeling in the pit of my stomach .
did you confront them ?
have you been listening to me ? kids don &apos;t confront in my family .
how does this pertain to the situation with your son ?
this amusement park is where i found out my father wasn &apos;t like other fathers .
i took the bus this time .
it was three transfers from newark .
i had this candy bar in my pocket .
it had sand or lint or something on it .
what you doing ? where you spitting ?
i ain &apos;t doing nothing !
you threw that wrapper on the floor .
pick it up !
leave me alone !
come back ! pick it up !
what in the world ?
stop or i &apos;ll shoot !
you &apos;re under arrest !
stop !
you &apos;re under arrest .
my leg !
name was cicchi sasso , my father &apos;s cousin on his mother &apos;s side .
got out of vietnam on account of cops blew his kneecap off .
what &apos;s the matter with you cops ?
can &apos;t bring your kid to an amusement park no more ?
daddy ! daddy !
it &apos;s okay , baby . it &apos;s okay .
you go home to mommy , sweetheart .
va fangool , why don &apos;t you go lock up the melanzane ?
they &apos;re burning down newark .
i want my lawyer . i &apos;m not saying shit to you .
that &apos;s johnny @-@ boy soprano !
asshole , you &apos;re hurting my wrist .
get the fuck in there , clarabell .
he used janice as a front . they brought their daughters ...
... so that their business looked sweet and innocent .
that must &apos;ve been devastating .
it turned out it was no big deal .
to see your father handcuffed and led away by the police ?
well , at the time i thought my head was gonna explode .
he looked helpless .
but when i got home , my mother had a different perspective .
which made me feel better .
so in her pain , she reached out to you .
that &apos;s one way to put it .
your father may not be home for dinner . go wash up .
i know .
what do you know ?
i saw him getting arrested . what did he do ?
he didn &apos;t do anything ! they just pick on italians .
still , in my heart , i knew my father was no freedom fighter .
so he went to jail ?
he came home in a couple hours .
we were watching ed sullivan .
hey ! livia !
look who &apos;s home .
what happened ?
what happened ?
i got you cherry vanilla at nasto &apos;s .
that didn &apos;t take long . must be in good with the uppity @-@ ups .
let this be a lesson .
those stupid cops , they went to the wrong place .
arrested the wrong guys .
how &apos;s my little girl ? you all right ?
i &apos;m okay .
good .
johnny @-@ boy ! hey , johnny @-@ boy !
good for you , johnny .
show those fucking sons of bitches .
what &apos;s up , rocco ?
so ...
... everything okay ?
i don &apos;t understand . the man your father beat up ...
... was the same one congratulating him ?
yeah . one of them .
rocco allatorre .
why &apos;d they arrest him ?
he was in violation of his parole .
association with known undesirables .
but nothing ever happened . it just went away .
he &apos;d been in prison ?
he was away when i was a kid ...
... but they told me he was in montana being a cowboy .
what ?
my son is doomed , right ?
why do you say that ?
this is the part where i &apos;m supposed to tell you ...
... how terrible my father was and the terrible things he did ...
... and how he ruined my life .
but i &apos;ll tell you , i was proud to be johnny soprano &apos;s kid .
when he beat the shit out of that guy ...
... i told the class how tough my father was .
is that how your son feels about you ?
yeah , probably .
and i &apos;m glad . i &apos;m glad if he &apos;s proud of me .
but that &apos;s the bind i &apos;m in . i don &apos;t want him to be like me .
he could be anything he wants .
he could be like a guy i knew in school .
his grandfather invented ties for the end of salamis .
he made millions of dollars . he &apos;s sitting on his ass .
have you communicated this to your son ?
not in so many words .
probably not at all .
what &apos;s the difference ? you said it .
it &apos;s in the blood . it &apos;s hereditary .
genetic predispositions are only that . predispositions .
it &apos;s not a destiny written in stone . people have choices .
she finally offers an opinion .
well , they do . you think everything that happens is preordained ?
you don &apos;t think that human beings possess free will ?
how come i &apos;m not making fucking pots in peru ?
you &apos;re born to this shit . you are what you are .
within that there &apos;s a range of choices .
this is america .
right . america .

okies and misfits , that &apos;s who goes there .
losers , the beverly hillbillies .
so now rocco allatorre &apos;s a loser ?
i &apos;ve had to rough rocco up because of money ,
but he &apos;s got a fucking brain .
he &apos;s opening a new book .
after that gets up , we get a little cash flow--
oh , mr. cash flow ! big businessman now .
what do you know ? you &apos;re scared of your own shadow .
reno is growing by leaps and bounds , livia .
it &apos;s a chance to get in on the ground floor .
after rocco gets the book up , he &apos;ll open a supper club .
he wants me to run it .
a supper club ? are you drunk ?
jesus christ almighty !
fucking albacore around my neck !
every time i try-- me and the kids &apos;ll go without you !
they are not going anywhere !
i &apos;d rather smother them with a pillow than take them to nevada !
always with the drama !
livia , here you are .
junior , you scared me to death .
i can &apos;t stay , but i didn &apos;t want to let another day go by .
business headaches like you won &apos;t believe .
oh , yeah , you and the other one . with all your headaches .

don &apos;t be so hard on him .
he &apos;s got a lot to learn , but he &apos;s headed in the right direction .
where to ? overbrook state mental hospital ?
what ?
hey , uncle jun. how you doing ?
he &apos;s keeping his hair .
you see , what a good boy , he comes to visit his mother .
my son &apos;s staying for dinner , junior . i don &apos;t suppose you have time .
you two want to visit each other .
junior &apos;s very busy these days with his headaches .
not too busy to shoot the shit with you , tony .
we gotta catch a ball game .
hey , you got my number . all right .
that man .
he &apos;s so full of himself since becoming caporegime .
he makes me sick .
remember the allatorres , ma ?
oh , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
they moved to nevada . they &apos;re billionaires now .
oh , that rocco allatorre , he was a real go @-@ getter .
didn &apos;t dad want to go with him ?
your father ? no .
yeah , he did . i remember you guys talking about it .
allatorre would start a business , dad would do it with him .
rocco just got him all worked up , that &apos;s all .
what is this with all these questions ?
dad wanted to go with him .
you wouldn &apos;t let him .
let him ?
what do you mean ?
you just tell me one time your father didn &apos;t do ...
... exactly as he wanted .
i don &apos;t know . maybe this was his chance to get out .
dad was no choirboy , but maybe with a little bit of support ....
mr. sensitive now .
well , if it bothers you , maybe you better talk to a psychiatrist .
what are you talking about , a psychiatrist ?
that &apos;s what people do when they want somebody to blame for their life .
you &apos;re a real stone player , aren &apos;t you ?
you threatened to smother his children .
what does that mean ?
everybody thought dad was ruthless , but i gotta hand it to you .
if you &apos;d been born after those feminists ...
... you would &apos;ve been the real gangster .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
please , sit .
i know you &apos;re probably eager to hear the results of our testing .
how &apos;s anthony doing ?
good , i think . don &apos;t you think so ?
yeah , i think so .
well , good .
let &apos;s get to it .
the good news is , no evidence of learning disability .
cognitive function , verbal and nonverbal intelligent testing ...
... arithmetic and reading evaluation ...
... all within normal range .
thank goodness .
got a clean bill of health .
no soft sign on the neurological , either .
that &apos;s all the good news . why don &apos;t you tell us the bad news ?
well , as to whether anthony has add ...
... the results were interesting .
the apa standard is for the subject to manifest six out of nine ...
... possible symptoms of add .
in testing , anthony manifested five of those symptoms .
five , really ?
he often has difficulty awaiting his turn ...
... is often quote @-@ unquote &quot; on the go , &quot; or acts as if driven by a motor ...
... often interrupts or intrudes on others ...
... and often fidgets with hands or feet .
he fidgets with hands or feet ?
that &apos;s right .
you mean , like , he fidgets .
and that &apos;s a sickness , to fidget ?
mr. soprano , it &apos;s one of nine possible symptoms .
what constitutes a fidget ?
no , no , what constitutes a fidget ?
so what if he fidgets ? who doesn &apos;t fidget in school ?
the kid &apos;s in puberty . he gets a hard @-@ on every 10 minutes .
anthony is a borderline case .
he &apos;s not a case , he &apos;s a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
every time you see a problem , you turn it into a disease .
he &apos;s a kid who made a mistake , and he &apos;ll pay for it .
but he &apos;s gonna be fine . come on .
i think he &apos;s right .
and i don &apos;t think we should have to pay for this testing .
to oppose this massive force bearing down on midway ...
... admiral nimitz had no battleships in shape for the fight .
however , he had the carriers ...
... yorktown , enterprise and hornet .
this might prove to be the trump card .
studying ?
government .
it &apos;s not the end of the world , anth .
i &apos;m depressed .
you &apos;re not depressed .
you &apos;re sad because you did something stupid , and you got grounded .
you can &apos;t watch tv or play on your computer for a couple weeks .
it &apos;s gonna stay like that .
it isn &apos;t fair .
you got that right .
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s it look like ?
can i have one too ?
this one &apos;s yours .
