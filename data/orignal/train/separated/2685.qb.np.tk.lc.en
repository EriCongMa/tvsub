we &apos;ve seen guys drag their dicks .
take advantage of the government &apos;s generosity , playing both ends .
will you give me a window over here ?
he &apos;s already suspicious. l gotta be careful .
altieri ate the pill for you .
any suspicions went to the grave with jimmy altieri .

he tried to suffocate his own mother .
his own uncle wanted him whacked .
you said he &apos;s been shitting on you for years .
l know what l said .
plus he &apos;s been crying to a shrink .
you don &apos;t owe him dick .
don &apos;t take a bullet for a yuppie who thinks you &apos;re his errand boy .
your honor , this man should not be released for medical reasons .
every time we get an elder mafioso incarcerated . . .
. . .we get the same bag of tricks .
your honor .
l take offense at the characterization of my client as a mafioso .
mr. soprano has not been found guilty of anything .
he &apos;s awaiting trial for allegations .
noted .
with all due respect to the state &apos;s medical facilities . . .
. . .in his condition , mr. soprano has every right . . .
. . .to seek the best medical care he can afford .
mr. soprano has a benign illness .
a few clogged arteries , your honor .
l &apos;m leaning towards releasing this man from lockup .
unless you can demonstrate a serious flight risk .
mr. soprano .
lf l approve this , you will be under house arrest .
you understand this concept ?
not really .
lt means that you must remain in your residence . you cannot leave .
except for doctor &apos;s appointments , food shopping .
your honor , the government asks for an electronic bracelet .
your honor , while we certainly agree to house arrest . . .
. . .we are asking that mr. soprano . . .
. . .not be further persecuted for yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ proven allegations .
he shows no prior arrest since 1.968 .
he pays his taxes and he &apos;s a veteran of the second world war .
mr. soprano , do you have any problem with wearing an electronic bracelet ?
lt sounds like nazi germany to me .
obviously you need a history lesson , sir .
l don &apos;t think that we , you and l . . .
. . .should let our shared sorrow or biases . . .
. . .enter into this , judge .
he &apos;s wearing a bracelet . . .
. . .to avoid any risk of flight .
who are you ?
jesus , you scared the shit out of me .
jesus ain &apos;t got nothing to do with it .

83 . get the fuck out of here !
what do you want with my son ?
gotta discuss a little business .
lf you say so .

that &apos;s a little long in the tooth .
ln &apos; 43 they was taking everyone , no matter how old or ugly .
they even took a fat boy l knew . he was already 34 .
wasn &apos;t no good to nobody , except he could cook .
l swear he was more dangerous with that . . .
. . .stove than he was with that rifle .
you ever watch the history channel ?
television ?
no , the history channel .
l think you &apos;d like it . they even do a lot of that bible shit .
only shit in the bible came out of pharaoh &apos;s ass . . .
. . .when moses parted the red sea .
parted the red sea , praise his name .
never underestimate a man &apos;s determination to be free .
l &apos;ll come back at another time .
break it , you pay for it .

l heard the tapes the feds made at green grove .
so she &apos;s crazy half the time . which half did you listen to ?
the half that makes no sense , or the half that played you like a child ?
nobody played me . she didn &apos;t know she was setting you up to get popped .
that &apos;s right ! your uncle isn &apos;t as dumb as you think !
you and that miserable fuck , altieri .
all of my capos meeting behind my back !
now you let sleeping dogs lie , okay ?
l have my reasons .
l &apos;ll tell you one dog you left barking , that fucking freddie capuano .
