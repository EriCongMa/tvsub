he has a gun . he has a gun . stay down .
oh , my god .
you still think he &apos;s a nice guy , jess ?
that &apos;s what i thought .

maybe violence is his only tool to express himself .
hi .

don &apos;t use guns !
stop it . just stop it . just get down .
we &apos;re sorry . take the spot .

he &apos;s overreacting .
i &apos;m overreacting ? he has a gun ,
and you &apos;re dressed like a bull &apos;s @-@ eye .
thank you , sir . thank you .
i can &apos;t believe this is working .
sorry .

you always see the worst in people .
here we go again .
another text message from work . look at that .
&quot; tokyo call at 11 : 00 ? &quot; this is driving me crazy !
what is she trying to say ?
i &apos;m not an expert at your industry at all ,
but , um , sounds like there &apos;s a call .
from tokyo .
sometime today .
oh , wait . at 11 : 00 .
you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve been getting a lot of mixed signals from my boss lately .
what is wrong with you ?
the world is not out to seduce you .
&quot; and bring me the budget reports . &quot;
why can &apos;t she just say what she wants ?
what kind of sick game is she playing ?
it &apos;s all in your head , man . it &apos;s always in your head .
nonfat vanilla latte .
we &apos;re not talking about coffee ...
are we ?
three , please .
are you sure you want me to ...
stop at three ?
i have a package for schmidt .
sir , i &apos;m very flattered , but i must decline .
he said he had a package
for schmidt .
oh , you &apos;re always starting fights with everyone , nick .
i mean , not everyone &apos;s out to get you .
he had a gun , jess !
he was literally out to get me .
isn &apos;t nick the most negative person you &apos;ve ever met ?
absolutely , and you know what ? it all pools up
right in that little satinous center below his belly button .
i mean , he &apos;s not wrong , though .
his life is genuinely terrible .
you know what , jess ?
i guess i don &apos;t live in a world where i smile ,
and people do what i want them to do .
you never smile .
a smile is a sign of weakness .
no !
all right , everybody relax .
get out !
it &apos;s fixed .
okay , nick , i &apos;m calling the landlord .
this is ridiculous .
don &apos;t call the landlord .
we don &apos;t need him here , and he &apos;s a jerk .
see , here &apos;s an example .
maybe you never gave him the chance
to show you what a great guy he is .
no , jess . he sucks .
yeah , he &apos;s a terrible person .
don &apos;t call the landlord , i &apos;m serious .
okay .
hey , kim , where should i put this ...
budget ... report ?
on the desk .
yeah , um , okay .
i &apos;ll just ... thanks . so ...
schmidt , my files need sorting .

okay .
so , you want me to ...
sort ... your files ?

what am i ... ? hmm ? okay .
because i probably got this one wet , so i &apos;m gonna re ...
i &apos;m just gonna replace all of them .

um , i know you probably think cupcakes are totally lame .
i know i do ,
so if you could do me a solid and
take care of those extras ?
cool office .
i like your ...
bucket of ...
gasoline .
it &apos;s super practical .
what you got there ?
broom .
so , i live in , um , four d.
there are a lot of real safety hazards in our loft .
nothing a little landlording couldn &apos;t fix .
what do you say ?
no .
that &apos;s a sweet picture .
how old are your kids ?
i did that .
it &apos;s me and my ex @-@ wife .
okay , you know what ? um ...
my roommates are really scared of you ,
but i know you &apos;re a good man ,
and i know you don &apos;t want the four of us
living in a dangerous apartment .
the four of you ?
apartment four d , there &apos;s only supposed to be three people .
oh , did i say four ?
you know what ?
i was counting myself twice .
it &apos;s so easy to do .
big personality over here , so ...
gonna go ...
hey , guys .
i &apos;ve got a fun exercise .
i &apos;d like everybody to take a moment
and think back to a time when they did something stupid ,
how they were treated , and how they wish they were treated .
what did you do , jess ?

oh , i &apos;ll miss him .

so , someone told me you have four people living here .
well , that idiot
probably doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about , so ...
you don &apos;t want ... you don &apos;t want to go in the library ...

why would you do this ?
this was schmidt &apos;s room , okay ? he painted this .
it is a sexually @-@ charged , zero @-@ gravity tea ceremony .

or you pay for it .
he &apos;s fair .
who painted that ?
giancarlo .
some creepo schmidt was obsessed with .
he used to wear a le ...
i sut you paint it , and you paint it fast !
have fun , buddy .
to be honest , i was expecting a lot worse , so just ...
four people is fine .
just paint over the sex wall , and don &apos;t bother me anymore .
hey , sir , wait .
jess , let .. let him go .
i just want to apologize on behalf of all of us
for lying to you about how many people live here .
stop reminding him .
but while you &apos;re up here , might as well
just fix a few things .
please ... remy ?
how did you know my name ? they call you ?
i saw your tattoo that says ,
&quot; hello , my name is remy , &quot;
and i just ... i took a leap of faith .
look , i know you &apos;re a good guy ...
okay , what do you ... what do you want fixed ?
why don &apos;t you close your eyes and point at something ?
her . not you .
schmidt ?
yeah .
i need you to clean up my hard drive .
okay , do you want me to reformat first ?
i said , i need you ...
to clean up ...
my hard drive .
i should have seen a divorce coming .
you know , we stopped doing the little things ,
like , talking .
one day , we were humping .
then everything changed .
we weren &apos;t humping .
that must have been really hard .
you know , it was what it was .
come on , remy .
it was hard .
it was hard .
all right , give it a shot .
great .
here , i &apos;ll help ...
i &apos;ll brace you . pull back .
use your hips . come on .
okay
oh , that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s it , is it ?
okay .
that &apos;ll do it .
hey , jess .
can i talk to you for a minute alone ?
so , what &apos;s up ? ready to admit you were wrong ?
hello . my name is nick , and i like eating crow .
that man wants to sleep with you .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
yes , he does .
he was just showing me
how to close a closet .
okay , anytime a man
shows a woman how to do something from behind ,
it &apos;s just an excuse for him to get really close
and breathe on her neck .
watch any sports movie .
that is not a thing .
you mind picking up that mug ?
oh , no , you &apos;re doing it all wrong .
here , let me show you .
no , no , no . i &apos;ve been doing this for years .
see , the way to pick up a mug is like that .
you just got to relax into it .
he wasn &apos;t doing that !
that &apos;s exactly what he was doing .
you always see the worst in people !
yeah , because people are the worst !
oh , five bucks !
look out , college . here i come !
that &apos;s it . people stink !
you must have been doing something .
are you seriously defending the man
who pushed me into the bushes ?
well , people can be good .
you just have to give them a chance to show you .
hey , little girl .
you like candy ?
i sure do !
great ! my nana made way too much !
why can &apos;t you admit you were wrong ?
i was nice , and now he &apos;s fixing our apartment .
i &apos;m working up an appetite in there .
boy , i hope you don &apos;t mind the smell of a real man in your room .
let me know when you want to get started on that bed .
okay .
he &apos;s turning my mattress .
yeah .
this is so wonderful .
oh , come on .
don &apos;t you ever wear jeans ?
honestly , you look like you should be
distracting james bond at a baccarat table .
no , i &apos;m actually gonna go meet kyle .
jess loaned me her seasickness bracelets .
going to a party on greg kinnear &apos;s boat .
you &apos;re going to a party on neptune &apos;s folly ?
yeah , relax . he &apos;s not going to be there .
i know , he &apos;s in rio till the 16th .
cece ,
can i talk to you , as a ...
as a woman ?
all right , schmidt .
my boss and i , we &apos;re running a pre @-@ sex marathon right now ,
and i feel like we &apos;re stuck in mile 25 .
i &apos;m cramping , cece , my toenails are falling off ,
i &apos;m peeing down my leg , it &apos;s like i can see
the finish line , but i just can &apos;t get there .
i need to put one of these on right now .
the problem is is we don &apos;t talk .
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s thinking .
should i make a move or not ?
stop asking permission and go get it .
that &apos;s what i would want .
there &apos;s nothing less sexy than a dude asking if he can kiss you .
nothing ? i mean , what if
i ate my own hair and pooped out a wig ?
what if i called my mom after sex to describe it to her ?
what if i had a croissant blog ?
two of these now .
hey , bob ross , how &apos;s painting going ?
going absolutely fantastic , schmidt ,
because everything is easy ...
&quot; when you are a battleship , invading the bay of success . &quot;
what ?
i have here
schmidt &apos;s new year &apos;s resolutions from 2007 .
oh , please , read on .
read my favorite one .
&quot; stop pursuing caroline .
she &apos;s nick &apos;s girl . &quot;
&quot; deal with it . &quot;
deal with it .
she &apos;s my girl .
okay , where &apos;d you find that ?
do not ever stop reading this .
i was very young . and drunk .
were you too drunk to &quot; begin the search for the cocoon ...
... that will one day release your butterfly &quot; ?
no , it does not say that one !
that &apos;s number three .
come on !
why are you doing this to me ?
maybe i just got
bored painting over your interplanetary ass dojo .
this is my favorite .
&quot; find out where winston gets his sparkle ,
and then steal it . &quot;
you were gonna steal my sparkle ?
give me that .
the funniest thing just happened .
i was watching remy fix the sink ,
and i got totally soaked .
you were so wet !
man overboard !
so i invited remy over
for dinner to thank him for all the stuff
he &apos;s been doing around the apartment . who &apos;s in ?
i gotta ...
i ... i got a boat , so ...
so , i guess it &apos;ll just be me and jess .
oh , no , remy .
i changed my mind ; i &apos;ll be there .
just watching you .
remy brought a bottle of ...
this ?
i ferment things in the basement .
i also make cheese .
hm , you &apos;re not drinking that , jess .
yes , i am , remy made it .
think you can handle some , nick ?
oh , i &apos;m okay .
somebody needs to stay sober to fight you later .
nick , be nice .
how hard could it be to just open yourself up a little bit ?
dip your toe in the pool of possibilities .
yeah , nick .
dip your toe .
you guys have a lot in common .
nick went through a break @-@ up last year
that was really hard on him .
schmidt said your mom had to fly out .
that was a scheduled trip .
did you smell your girl on your sheets for months
until they were too soaked through
with your own sweat and tears ?
no .
did you punch out
all the windows
until you hit the wall and broke your hand ?
did you go out , looking for companionship ,
a little human warmth ,
only to come to in the woods covered in animal blood ?
in my own way .
come here , man .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
well , i guess i &apos;ll just go home and open a bottle of wine .
yeah , i &apos;ll probably just do the same .
i want you .
now .
finally .
no , no , no , no , she wanted me to ! oh , dip !
no , no ! stop ! stop hitting him !
she wanted me to ! consensual , guys !
tap out , ow , tap out !
oh , man , tonight is just ...
i @-@ i honestly didn &apos;t know if i &apos;d ever enjoy myself again .
so ... thanks .
bathroom break .
see ?
i was right .
what do you mean , you &apos;re right ?
you &apos;re wrong .
you see the way he &apos;s buttering me up so he can move in on you ?
why can &apos;t you just admit that you were wrong ?
how have you lived this long on your own ?
there is no part of that man that wants to sleep with me .
he &apos;s been creeping on you all night .
no , he hasn &apos;t been .
open your eyes , like , i &apos;m worried ...
hey , remy , what happened to your pants ?
i &apos;ve never done a threesome .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing here , right ?
this i did not expect .
i love watching you be wrong , jess .
i might &apos;ve been a little bit off about remy ,
but people are generally good , and i &apos;m not wrong about that .
jess , people are jerks .
he is hurting from his divorce ...
are you still making excuses for this guy ?
well , look , if you feel so bad , then just get in there .
just dip your toe into the pool of possibility .
hey , remy , let &apos;s get weird and toss that ball around , huh ?
so turned on .
okay , you would
seriously have a threesome with that man
just to get me to admit that i &apos;m wrong ?
i think we could do a lot worse than remy .
he &apos;s got strong arms .
let &apos;s have a threesome .
all right , so , a menage a trois is about
three of us ... trois ... sure .
... menage @-@ ing fully .
oui .
okay .
this is happening with this guy .
this is happening right now , jess .
yeah .
so , it &apos;s gonna get even a little more uncomfortable .
we just have to keep talking with each other , all right ?
around and communicating .
let &apos;s get some relax music going .
great idea , great idea .
okay ? all right .
thank you .
why can &apos;t you just admit that he &apos;s a good guy ?
we are about to have a menage a trois &apos; cause you won &apos;t admit
you &apos;re wrong . you &apos;re out of your mind .
i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s a good guy .
yeah , get into it .
i am so into this .
i can &apos;t wait till we &apos;re all menage @-@ ing .
are you into this , jess ?
yeah .
say you &apos;re wrong .
no , turn this up . it &apos;s great .
say it &apos;s over , and it &apos;s over .
don &apos;t get nervous , nick .
this is just a regular conversation we &apos;re having .
except i &apos;m rubbing your back .
that &apos;s right .
and then i &apos;m going to start
unbuttoning your pants ,
and then i &apos;m gonna
unbutton my shirt .
i &apos;m not gonna take my underpants off , though .
not right away , i &apos;m gonna keep my underpants on
until i let you take my underpants off , nick .
okay ? because you
are gonna be the underpants captain tonight .
makes sense .
great choice , remy .
nick will make a fantastic underpants captain .
let &apos;s bring it in . okay .
you two get us started .
me and jess get it started ?
yeah .
all right ? go ahead .
us two , getting it started .
you know what to do .
breathe into each other .
oh , yeah , jess . i &apos;m not here .
relax into the menage .
let &apos;s get this started , nick .
you doing this ?
yes .
come together .
are you doing this ?
yes .
i will do it .
all right , okay .
we &apos;re gonna do it .
then let &apos;s do this .
nick , i will do this .
say that you &apos;re wrong , and it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m not wrong .
jess , you can &apos;t do this .
but i can .
okay .
let &apos;s do this , nick .
let &apos;s do it , jess .
i can do it .
no , okay !
fine , i admit it , i &apos;m wrong .
yes ! yes !
i &apos;m sorry , remy .
what , we &apos;re not doing this ?
we &apos;re not doing it .
i get it , cold feet is just , you know ,
it &apos;s part of the journey , so ...
what is going on in here ?
all right , i am not ready for a four @-@ way .
that &apos;s , uh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m out of this .
to be honest , i &apos;m kind of riding a weird ego high .
why didn &apos;t you tell me
four people couldn &apos;t live in this apartment ?
if we &apos;re gonna do a shenanigan , i &apos;m fine with doing shenanigans .
i love shenanigans ,
as long as no one gets hurt .
okay , just so we &apos;re clear ,
we &apos;re gonna have to live with this , right ?
yep .
absolutely .
hey , kim ?
look , i just wanted to apologize for yesterday .
i hope you didn &apos;t get into too much trouble , i just ...
i really don &apos;t want to lose my job , okay ?
i &apos;ve worked at associated strategies for six years .
nothing means more to me than ass strat .
your lip is bleeding .
it opens back up when i talk .
look ... kim , this wasn &apos;t your standard 2 : 00 a.m.
mistaken assault in the parking garage .
i &apos;ve had a thing for you every since i was
the husky kid in the mailroom .
and if ... if you don &apos;t believe me ...
here you go .
straight from &apos; 07 . read resolution number four .
it &apos;s about you .
&quot; only think about hot new c.f.o. every other time i masturbate . &quot;
i did not live up to the challenge .
number seven : &quot; start floating idea that people call me
mr. finish / game time jones /
the hook @-@ up @-@ erator . &quot;

number nine : &quot; just pick a color of crocs and buy them already . &quot;
