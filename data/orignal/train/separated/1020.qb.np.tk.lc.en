that was a tough case .
it was a multimillion @-@ dollar embezzlement scam .
all right , i &apos;ll give that to you ,
but all you got to do is follow the money .
look , i &apos;ll show you . do you have a quarter ?
will i get it back ?
depends . if it disappears , can you find it ?
what are you , a party clown ?
i &apos;m embezzling your quarter .
there &apos;s a crime in progress . solve it .
it &apos;s in your right pant pocket .
you didn &apos;t make the switch with your right hand . case closed .
how &apos;d you know ?
because i kept my eye on the quarter .
see ? all you got to do is follow the money .
you &apos;re brilliant . but we &apos;ve got a new case .
neal .
thank you .
since when do we handle murders ?
since it &apos;s linked to corporate espionage .
the victim worked for novice systems .
tech firm ?
yeah , they manufacture
everything from cellphones to supercomputers .
meet joseph hayes .
he was novice &apos;s lead r &amp; d specialist .
dropped dead of a heart attack .
what was he carrying ?
a next @-@ gen quantum microprocessor .
anybody know what that is ?
sure .
it &apos;s a very small ...
tool ...
... tool .
... for binary code @-@ breaking .
novice was vying for a defense contract
with several competitors .
according to their p.r. ,
hayes had a functioning prototype ,
which put them in the lead of that competition .
how do we know he was murdered ?
toxicology report
says there was digitalis in his bloodstream .
somebody killed him and stole the prototype .
any suspects ?
wesley kent , founder and c.e.o.
he &apos;s pointing fingers at his competitors ,
but according to nypd ,
he had an after @-@ hours meeting on his calendar with hayes
the night that he died .
his initial statement contradicted
the timeline from the coroner &apos;s report .
in other words , kent &apos;s hiding something .
looks like it .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m sending someone in undercover to the company .
i know a bit about corporate culture , so ...
sit down .
novice has its annual audit scheduled
for the beginning of next week .
it &apos;s a perfect opportunity
for us to get the access we haven &apos;t been allowed .
kent is expecting an accountant from banefield financial
to show up at his offices .
well , if i &apos;m not going in , who is ?
peter lassen , cpa , at your service .
thought you joined the fbi to avoid number crunching .
glad your accounting degree hasn &apos;t gone to waste .
i was recruited by several fortune 500 companies .
single or double windsor ?
single . it &apos;s hard to picture you at a big financial firm .
been a life @-@ changer .
that &apos;s true .
in some alternate universe ,
you &apos;d be wearing power ties , doing power lunches ,
flying corporate jets .
doubt we &apos;d have ever met .
well , maybe .
under different circumstances .
well , that &apos;s true .
you might have robbed the company .
yep .
you could have had a mansion .
i like my house .
horses . a stable in the hamptons .
i &apos;ve got a dog .
no regrets , huh ?
no . i &apos;ve got the bureau . i &apos;ve got elizabeth .
no . no regrets .
banefield putting you up ?
yeah , company booked me in a suite at a four @-@ star hotel .
impressive .
yeah .
almost as impressive
as your getting kate &apos;s flight @-@ recorder data .
that &apos;s right . sara told me .
neal , if you &apos;re working on this , so am i.
i &apos;m not working on anything .
which means mozzie &apos;s working on it .
i want somebody from my team involved .
peter , he does not ...
no protests .
we are working on this together .
all right , who &apos;d you have in mind ?
diana .
what ? she &apos;ll eat him alive .
well , he &apos;s not much of a meal .
i want you to arrange a meeting .
are you sure this ...
go .
i look good .
peter lassen .
can i see your bag , please ?
the basket is for your phone .
i &apos;m ellen samuel , mr. kent &apos;s personal assistant .
sorry for the security , but we can &apos;t risk
our visitors leaving with
any sensitive information .
i understand .
you can pick up your phone and
your laptop at the front desk on your way out .
if you &apos;ll just follow me ,
mr. kent would like a word before you start .
after you .
thank you .
sorry we can &apos;t give you your own swipe key .
they &apos;re for employees only .
executive offices are just around the corner .
mr. kent , this is mr. lassen .
mr. kent , pleasure to meet you .
wesley ... please . you mind if i call you peter ?
no , not at all .
good .
you &apos;re gonna be with us for the week ,
might as well work on a first @-@ name basis .
most c.e.os aren &apos;t as welcoming to an external auditor .
well , you &apos;re just looking at our books .
armagnac ... my daily vice .
i thought that we could , uh ...
you know , drink to your new home for the week .
ah , sorry , but not on the job .
suit yourself .
i &apos;ll be coordinating with my team at banefield financial .
the first thing i &apos;ll need to send to them
are expense reports from your senior staff .
whatever you want , we will provide .
and miss samuel is at your service .
if you can just show me where to set up ...
i &apos;m sorry ?
my office ... where is it ?
peter ...
this is your office .
we all want the same thing , ok ?
now , if we can come together ... &quot; together &quot; being the key word ...
we can move forward .
look , if i &apos;m gonna spend my time working with lady suit ,
it &apos;d better be worth it .
and if i &apos;m gonna spend my precious time
supervising your pocket @-@ sized pal ,
he better watch what he says .
why are you even here ?
because my boss asked me . you ?
uh , because neal asked me .
so neal &apos;s your boss ?
hey , i answer to no one , nancy drew !
i already have one fed in my life .
and i &apos;ve got plenty of crooks in mine .
hey , hey . we need to find fowler .
we know kate tried to contact him
after peter showed up at the hangar that day .
he &apos;s the only one who can tell us what really happened .
please .
fine . but i have rules .
you have rules ?
you will meet me with all the pertinent files
at a time and place of my choosing .
i will contact you via express courier .
you will receive a package .
in that package will be a sonnet
giving clue to our rendezvous point .
you want to send me a sonnet ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t do scavenger hunts . or poems .
ah , this is jones .
go . i can handle this .
i don &apos;t get handled !
guys , please .
adults .
hey . we &apos;re good ?
yeah , we &apos;re good .
warrant came through for the novice hard drives ,
so we &apos;ll be looking for anything relevant to hayes .
come on , peter . where are you ?
... and an index of your earnings reports .
can i get you anything else ?
i &apos;m fine .
coffee ?
sure . coffee .
espresso , cappuccino , macchiato ?
regular coffee &apos;s fine .
do you have a preferred blend ?
just plain old coffee .
we have brazil bourbon santos ,
a panamanian boquete , and an ethiopian sidamo .
i prefer the mediterranean espresso .
the beans are imported from the cafe vivace in rome .
italian roast ?
mm .
yeah , let &apos;s go with that one .
remote access . well done .
timbuktu software peter installed
just gave me access to the entire novice database .
all i have to do is get around the server &apos;s firewalls .
and we &apos;re in .
that was fast .
a catalogued index of our earnings reports .
excellent .
and here &apos;s your espresso .
thank you .
got it .
i assume you have everything you need ?
i do now .
yeah ... that &apos;s good .
can you see me ?
i can .
look at us being a modern couple .
i know . okay , so , how &apos;s the room ?
uh , not a room , honey . it &apos;s a suite .
see for yourself .
looks pretty fantastic .
oh , wait a minute . look at this view . look at it .
there &apos;s a button that opens the curtains automatically .
and i &apos;ve got a baby grand .
well , it looks like you have everything you need .
well , not everything .
let me show you the best part of the room ...
you .
oh , thanks for bringing me along .
all right , now , get back to work .
i miss you .
miss you back .
anybody see you ?
no , i double @-@ backed through the service entrance .
you sweep the place ?
yeah , minute i walked in . it &apos;s clean .
nice digs , peter .
maybe you picked the wrong universe to live in .
nope .
no , no , no . stay out of there .
six bucks for a candy bar .
yeah , it &apos;s on the tab . embrace your hypothetical self .
i don &apos;t do hypothetical .
oh , we speculate all the time .
on our cases . not on my life choices .
no touching .
come on . what do you have ?
didn &apos;t get anything on kent , but jones found
something pretty interesting on hayes &apos; computer .
failed password attempts .
the day hayes died ,
someone tried to access his office desktop .
they tried variations on his birthday ,
a bunch of song titles , and the name of the dog he had as a kid .
somebody had a close relationship with him .
looks like novice has a mole .
all right , kent and his upper management
can access any e @-@ mail account that they want .
they wouldn &apos;t have to go fishing for a password .
we can rule them out .
well , we need to dig into the junior execs .
since i &apos;m the auditor ,
i can &apos;t be hanging around the water cooler .
but maybe you could .
you &apos;re sending me in ? how ?
kent &apos;s kissing my butt .
he wants a clean audit so badly
that maybe he &apos;d hire a friend of mine
who &apos;s looking for work in marketing .
if i pull the strings , think you can land the job ?
marketing ?
i can do marketing .
i had westen farms conduct a poll
on what people found aesthetically pleasing
in their cereal bowls .
you know what people liked to see ?
what ?
raisins .
raisins ?
well , a finite amount of raisins .
market research gave us the key formula ...
6 to 1 flake @-@ to @-@ raisin ratio .
i made sure every box we packaged met that standard .
sales went through the roof .
that &apos;s how you got this job ?
breakfast cereal ?
ready @-@ to @-@ eat @-@ cereal market ,
$ 10.7 billion last year .
right , the little plastic prizes in the box .
yeah . that &apos;s billion with a &quot; b. &quot;
but tech &apos;s where it &apos;s at , dawg .
that &apos;s why i want to talk to you guys ,
you know , get some pointers .
want to grab some drinks later ?
oh , well , we &apos;ve already booked a dinner at draytons , so ...
oh , you should come .
jessica ...
screw you , trent .
andrew ?
fine with me .
see ?
fine . you can play the game .
he can play the game , right ?
what &apos;s the game ?
it &apos;s a little tradition we have here .
it &apos;s called credit @-@ card roulette .
go out , run up a nice tab , throw all our company cards
on the table , and let the server pick one .
and that card foots the bill .
blows your dinner budget for the month .
you up for it ?
lock &apos; n &apos; load , trent .
mr. danvary ? george .
the auditor would like to see you .
he spoke to accounting
and has some questions about your 2009 w2s .
uh @-@ oh . excuse me .
see you guys later .
i don &apos;t like him .
you don &apos;t like anyone , trent .
i like andrew .
&apos;cause i owe you money , trent .
thank you .
you are stepping up in the world .
well , it &apos;s not really my office .
can it be mine ?
you already have a workspace .
oh , yeah , i get a cubicle . you get a palace .
i work harder .
yeah .
hat .
how &apos;s the marketing department ?
oh , nice blend of smarmy and suspicious .
i &apos;ll narrow it down later .
i &apos;m meeting everyone for dinner tonight .
oh .
espresso ?
i &apos;ve always liked espresso .
no more ugly fbi mugs for you .
i think you missed your calling .
tiny cup , big office , expensive suits .
ugly mugs are fine .
don &apos;t fight your instincts , peter .
embrace your true self .
you done ?
i can keep going .
you &apos;re done . what time is dinner tonight ?
9 : 00 . what are you thinking ?
if we do have a mole , we might be able to bait &apos; em .
you &apos;re pretty good at chitchat , right ?
you want me to spread some gossip ?
tell everyone that you noticed i was looking into hayes &apos; files .
maybe i found something interesting .
let &apos; em think you found something on the dead guy .
our mole will want to poke around your office .
yeah , make him come to us .
i &apos;m on it .
how much was the smoked squab ?
more than the lobster tartine , trent .
which is why i had to raise you with the opus .
uh , uh ... three bottles of opus ?
no matter who loses ,
someone &apos;s gonna have to answer to accounting .
or kent himself .
i haven &apos;t met him yet .
look , the only thing you need to know
about the boss is that he likes the high life
almost as much as he likes quarterly profit .
and he also likes his daily armagnac .
buying him a bottle every now and then
will help you stay on his good side .
thanks for the tip .
so , uh , what &apos;s up with the hat ?
oh , that &apos;s just my humble assault on the commonplace .
i like it .
kind of weird .
so , um , what happened with joseph hayes ?
he was head of r &amp; d , right ?
he was working on the quantum processor .
somebody told me he was murdered .
uh , w @-@ why do you care ?
oh , when i was in the auditor &apos;s office ,
hayes &apos; file was on his desk .
why is the auditor looking into hayes ?
i don &apos;t know . he had all your files too .
are you serious ?
yeah .
uh , here comes the bill .
well , all right .
bump @-@ bump , bump @-@ bump @-@ bump
what &apos;s the damage ?
ooh ! ouch ! $ 2,000 .
so , hat guy , in or out ?
oh , i &apos;m in .
all right .
shaking it up .
i &apos;m not looking , i &apos;m not looking .
you do the honors ?
hey , uh , pick a winner , honey .
ooh , i guess you win . trent .
that &apos;s great . owie .
great .
hope that bonus comes through .
gotcha .
jessica .
george . hey . you surprised me .
really ? you don &apos;t like surprises ?
what are you doing here ?
working late .
how about you ?
what are you doing in the auditor &apos;s office ?
you told me the auditor was looking into us .
i don &apos;t like anyone looking into my life ...
personally or professionally .
it &apos;s a little hypocritical ,
considering your current position , don &apos;t you think ?
you said you were working late .
what is it you &apos;re working on , george ?
i needed to see r &amp; d &apos;s field studies
on the new product launch .
oh , those are in records on 12 .
12 . got it . mm .
so , uh , why didn &apos;t you call security ?
you could have reported me .
i &apos;m here after hours . i could be up to anything .
which means you could probably report me , too .
well ...
i won &apos;t tell if you won &apos;t .
you &apos;re probably asleep right now .
oh , i know , it &apos;s too late for coffee ,
but this is ethiopian sidamo .
and it &apos;s not decaf , and it &apos;s delicious .
i know i &apos;ll be tossing all night ,
which would probably drive you crazy if you were here .
or i was there .
yep ...
... this could have been my life .
any regrets ?
no .
but it &apos;s not all that bad .
the coffee &apos;s good , and we should think about silk sheets .
i never saw myself as a robe guy , but i don &apos;t know .
when in rome ...
room service .
i love you .
coming !
look at you .
what , you &apos;re staying in character
in case i &apos;m one of kent &apos;s minions ?
all right , what do you have ?
she took the bait .
hmm . jessica breslin .
she &apos;s been at the company for the last 14 months .
when did novice put in its bid for the defense contract ?
18 months ago .
so it &apos;s possible she &apos;s spying for one of their competitors .
she could lead us to whomever she &apos;s working for .
room service .
uh , yeah , come on in .
keeping up appearances ?
a man has to eat .
your kobe steak , sir .
ah , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome , sir .
nothing but the best
for peter lassen , cpa extraordinaire .
i think you &apos;re jealous that i got the penthouse
and you got the paperwork for once .
it &apos;s true . up is down . black is white .
let &apos;s focus on jessica .
she &apos;s been sending out a lot more mail since hayes died .
most of it to a p.o. box in white plains .
company doesn &apos;t do any business in white plains .
exactly .
i &apos;ll have jones get a warrant for that p.o. box .
you get a chance to check out jessica &apos;s office , take it .
sure .
what &apos;s that ?
looks like kent &apos;s inviting me to dinner tomorrow night .
晚上8点 韦斯利 · 肯特
ooh , look at that . wow .
this smells delicious . you want some ?
no , i &apos;m good .
you sure ?
ah , ate before i came .
oh , you had some kobe , as well ?
yep .
look at that . okay . what is kobe beef ?
are you ready yet ?
i have a process .
i didn &apos;t even get to write my sonnet yet .
you have o.c.d.
uh , some might call it highly attentive .
okay . i did a full background check on fowler .
there &apos;s been no hits on his credit cards ,
bank accounts , or passport .
i showed you mine . you show me yours .
don &apos;t ever say that again .
understood .
this is all we have on him .
this is just fowler &apos;s resignation from the bureau .
yeah , as of five weeks ago .
o.p.r. booted him , swept the whole thing under the rug .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
oh , no , not at all .
you are but a welcome and striking reprieve
from the bureaucratic oppression in my midst .
isn &apos;t he charming ?
he has a way with words .
yes , he does .
i wanted to speak to you for a moment , please .
peter gave me some forms
regarding neal &apos;s housing arrangements ,
and i &apos;m not sure that i understand them .
oh , sure .
please .
well , of course you can &apos;t understand them .
bureaucracy has a vested interest
in creating the chaos in which they exist .
right here .
oh , yeah , yeah .
it says that you can set neal &apos;s curfew if you want .
uh , you can also establish any procedure you deem appropriate
for preventing a criminal relapse .
i think neal is doing just fine .
we &apos;ll talk later .
okay .
bye , mozzie .
bye , june .
i got to get back to my office in 20 minutes .
i need copies of every statement you have .
oh , of course . i &apos;ll e @-@ mail them to you .
lunch ?
yep .
邮箱 98437 @-@ 2a
do you have five minutes to look over the kensington proposal ?
uh , legal needs to see
my prep work on the north @-@ morrison outlets .
five minutes is gonna kill you , jess ?
if it &apos;s five minutes ,
why don &apos;t you do it yourself ?
i wrote it . i can &apos;t check my own work .
oh , come on . have an intern do it .
thanks , appreciate it .
novice communications . how may i direct your call ?
how are you doing today ?
good .
jessica &apos;s putting together intel on wesley kent .
she &apos;s digging into his travel arrangements .
what does she want with the c.e.o. ?
he could be another target .
jones got our warrant .
he &apos;s gonna get ahold of me as soon as he gets to white plains .
we find anything incriminating , i &apos;m bringing her down .
where you headed ?
oh , business lunch .
hey . all right , let &apos;s make this quick .
i need to get back to the office .
first week , and you &apos;re already a corporate shill ?
my condolences on your recently departed integrity .
how &apos;d it go with diana ?
i saw some sheet music in her briefcase .
maybe she &apos;s learning the violin .
it was mozart &apos;s &quot; piano sonata no . 2 in &apos; f &apos; &quot; from 1775 .
the year the music box was made .
need i go on ?
i &apos;m sure you will .
i will . there &apos;s no historical record
of what song it &apos;s playing .
the only way she would know it &apos;s mozart
is if she &apos;s heard it .
peter trusts diana . and i trust him .
ah , could be something . could be nothing .
i just thought you should know .
also , you &apos;ve got a tail .
yeah , i noticed a couple blocks back .
listen , i &apos;ll worry about my shadow .
in the meantime , stay close to diana .
why don &apos;t i just go have coffee with hughes while i &apos;m at it ?
you &apos;re a hero , moz .
jessica .
who do you work for ? you work with kent ?
no , no . i &apos;m with the fbi .
i was sent in to find out if you murdered joseph hayes .
i didn &apos;t murder joseph .
then who did ?
that &apos;s what i want to find out .
your hand gun was registered to joseph hayes .
you want to explain that ?
joseph and i were close .
you were seeing each other .
yes .
but we couldn &apos;t tell anyone .
what do you know about the project he was working on ?
the microprocessor ?
mm @-@ hmm .
he said he was close to a functioning prototype .
kent claimed the prototype was already working .
he lied .
let &apos;s focus on you for a second .
why did you break into hayes &apos; e @-@ mail account ,
rummage through his desktop ?
the day before he was murdered ,
joseph was acting ... different .
he said someone was following him .
he said not to tell anyone anything about what i knew .
and then he gave me the gun .
and you started playing detective ?
kent murdered someone i care about very much .
and i would do anything to make sure he pays .
look , he &apos;s been taking trips , okay ?
by himself , under the guise of business .
eastern europe , china . no one knows why .
you were trying to find out .
i was trying to get into kent &apos;s office .
i &apos;ve been seeing garbage bins coming out of there .
he &apos;s been destroying documents ...
shredding them and then putting them in burn bags .
what would it take to get in there ?
all right , let &apos;s start with the good news .
tech lab has a remote scanner
that they can attach to the head of kent &apos;s shredder .
makes a copy before it shreds anything ... nice .
something wrong with your coffee ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;ve been spoiled .
it &apos;s fine .
all right , the bad news is getting the scanner in place .
kent &apos;s office is tough .
not even building security has clearance .
the only people allowed inside are kent and his assistant .
which is also the good news because at lunch time ,
no one will be on the entire floor .
these are the key @-@ cards that give them access
to the top floor of the building .
we can &apos;t duplicate them .
kent also has a voice @-@ activated security system
that unlocks the door to his office .
it opens and responds to his voice only .
well , do we know what the password is ?
thanks to your friend jessica , we do .
&quot; faber est suae quisque fortunae . &quot;
&quot; every man is the artisan of his own fortune . &quot;
now , i had jones looking through on @-@ air interviews with kent ,
seeing if he can string together some audio clip .
yeah , well , i doubt he speaks a dead language
when he does press .
can we get kent to say it into a recorder ?
oh , i &apos;ve got an idea .
your dinner with kent . all right .
i like it .
mr. kent , good to see you .
i told you ... call me wesley .
yes , you did .
drink ?
oh , peter , please , i insist you treat yourself .
you &apos;re not on the job now , are you ?
scotch and soda .
there we go .
i appreciate the invite .
well , it &apos;s the least i could do .
believe me , i wish i could do more .
oh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine , really .
how would you like to come work for me ?
a member of my finance committee
is stepping down in a couple of months .
it &apos;s a very lucrative position .
i &apos;m in the middle of auditing your company ,
and you &apos;re offering me work ?
well , i &apos;ve seen your credentials .
peter lassen looks damn good on paper ,
but he &apos;d look even better in my offices .
i &apos;ve already got a job .
no .
no , working for novice is more than a job .
it &apos;s an achievement .
it &apos;s a new beginning .
hence the name of your corporation .
you know your latin .
i understand the etymology of novice .
and synonymous with the newly arrived ...
unique and original .
i also know a few other words .
da mihi factum , dabo tibi ius .
&quot; give me the facts , and i will give you the law . &quot;
you want the facts ?
i want incentive , details .
okay .
what i &apos;m working on right now
is gonna set up the company and everyone in it for life .
look , i &apos;m a self @-@ made guy ...
so am i.
and i believe that every man makes his own fortune
with a good decision .
the politician caecus .
he had a saying for that , didn &apos;t he ?
faber est suae quisque fortunae .
&quot; every man is an artisan to his own fortune . &quot;
amen .
he offered you a job ?
i got what we needed .
yeah , but , peter , think of all the tiny cups you could own .
kent &apos;s meeting his r &amp; d team today at 1 : 00 .
you think you can snatch one of those key @-@ cards ?
yeah , won &apos;t be a problem .
how &apos;s jessica holding up ?
she put her game face on .
time for you to do the same .
... just grab the comic @-@ book novel ?
i did , i did .
and i put it on your desk for , uh , next tuesday .
faber est suae quisque fortunae .
so , how &apos;d you even get in there ?
faber est suae quisque fortunae .
they have some pretty fun toys around here .
so , have they found anything yet ?
well , agents are going through the latest scans now .
we &apos;re gonna find something .
you know , even if you arrest him ...
it won &apos;t change what happened .
i understand .
i don &apos;t think you do .
do you know how joseph died ,
how he was poisoned ?
this chemical ...
it drops the heart rate , spikes the blood pressure .
you can &apos;t see .
and a few minutes later , you can &apos;t feel .
you &apos;re dead .
you can &apos;t think about that .
it &apos;s all i can think about .
if someone took away the person you loved ,
wouldn &apos;t you want them to know how it feels ?
be right back .
we just pulled this from the shredder in kent &apos;s office .
this is hayes &apos; prototype .
yeah . and it never worked .
kent tried to make it look like espionage ,
and he had the damn thing the whole time .
this is the cover @-@ up .
neal ...
i think i know why hayes was killed .
we found another document in the shredder .
it &apos;s addressed to an unnamed foreign intelligence agency
to arrange a meeting in the next month and a half .
the trips he &apos;s been taking ...
kent knew he wouldn &apos;t win the defense contract
from our country in time .
so he decided to sell his device to another government .
it &apos;s treason for profit .
hayes didn &apos;t want any part of that .
that &apos;s why kent killed him .
and corporate espionage is the perfect cover .
he made it look like a competitor stole a working product .
company saves face ...
if a foreign government turns up with it later ...
kent &apos;s in the clear ,
and hayes stays silent .
how do we prove it when kent hasn &apos;t
committed treason yet ?
but he has committed murder .
the c.e.o. &apos; s concerned
about anyone finding out what he &apos;s really up to .
maybe hayes talked to someone before he died .
you want to use jessica as bait ?
i &apos;m meeting kent in the afternoon .
maybe i can hint to him that she knows something .
he &apos;ll come after her .
and when he does , we take him down .
think she &apos;s up to it ?
she &apos;s certainly driven .
yeah , that &apos;s what worries me .
i &apos;m not sure if she wants revenge or justice .
can &apos;t blame her either way .
you have empathy for that woman .
what if i do ?
there &apos;s a right way to do things and a wrong way .
revenge is the wrong way .
it &apos;s short @-@ sighted , and it &apos;s dangerous .
what &apos;s justice , then ?
it &apos;s restoring order ... not furthering chaos .
you kept that recording data from me .
i hope you don &apos;t have any more secrets .
likewise .
you talked to diana lately ?
not today .
you trust her ?
as much as you trust your friend .
is there a problem ?
what happens if we do find fowler ?
what comes next ?
we &apos;ll cross that bridge when we come to it ...
together .
now let &apos;s prep the team for what we have today .
hey , it &apos;s time .
you know the drill ?
we meet as planned . and then we go to the safe house .
right . there &apos;s no reason to be nervous .
i &apos;m not . see you outside .
advanced copy of my report .
your company has nothing to worry about .
well , this is cause for celebration .
there is one other thing about one of your staff members .
uh , jessica breslin was involved
with one of your former employees
in research and development ...
joseph hayes .
uh , how do you know this ?
cross @-@ referenced expense reports between your workers
to see if any them were in a league to bilk funds .
apparently , the two of them shared a hotel room
a few weeks in a row .
when i confronted ms. breslin about it ,
she asked me not to say anything .
i thought you might want to deal with her appropriately .
well , i will take care of ms. breslin .
now , more importantly ,
have you thought any more about my offer ?
i hate to sound like a broken record ,
but i &apos;ve already got a job .
okay .
well , if you change your mind ...
i appreciate that , wesley .
you on the job ?
it is after 6 : 00 .
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
hey . doing okay ?
all right . an agent will be here any second .
she &apos;s gonna need your phone and all forms of i.d.
for the protection detail .
sure .
pretty calm for somebody who &apos;s about to go into hiding .
thought i was supposed to be relieved .
hello ?
are you sitting down ?
what is it , moz ?
sitting or standing ?
standing .
then you better hold on to something .
i did some additional checking . peter knows diana has the box .
what ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to say anything until i was sure .
but the trail for the box just goes cold with him .
neal , there can &apos;t be any other explanation .
neal ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
faber est suae quisque ...
why do you have this ?
um , i @-@ i found it on your desk .
you were in kent &apos;s office . what &apos;d you do , jessica ?
i wanted him to know how it feels
to die the way that joseph died .
poisoned him ? how ?
daily vice .
the armagnac .
peter &apos;s in there with him !
what is this ?
there &apos;s a powder on this .
i got to get to the phone and call 911 .
i @-@ i need to get to the top floor .
nobody gets to the top floor .
this is an emergency , sir .
what &apos;s the emergency ?
please !
i got to check with mr. kent and then my supervisor .
yes , good . yes , check with kent .
hey !
stop !
call 911 .
get back here ! i will call the police .
good . call the paramedics .
you need to exit the elevator now , sir !
will you send me up to kent &apos;s floor ?
hell no !
then i can &apos;t .
this is alpha @-@ 2 in the lobby . where &apos;s my backup ? !
on the way , sir .
how much time do we have ?
how much time do we have ? is there an antidote ?
is there an antidote ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
how much time did hayes have ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on , kent ! think !
this is the same poison
that you gave him !
you met with him , you gave him something to drink .
and then he died . now , how much time passed ?
who are you ?
how much time , kent ?
how much time , kent ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
15 ... 15 , 20 ...
what ?
i don &apos;t ... 15 minutes .
peter !
come on , buddy .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
stay with me , all right ? hang in there .
get kent .
no , no . peter , we don &apos;t have time .
come on .
you can &apos;t leave him behind .
you are dying !
neal ! neal !
we don &apos;t leave anybody behind .
heart &apos;s stopped . i need the epinephrine .
no , nothing on the pulse .
clear !
what ... what ... what are you doing ?
you confessed to a federal agent .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of joseph hayes .
you can &apos;t be serious .
you give me the facts , i &apos;ll give you the law .
thanks , di .
i &apos;m not the only one who makes dumb decisions .
saving kent ?
you &apos;re taking this &quot; innocent till proven guilty &quot;
thing a little too far .
if he lives or dies , it &apos;s not my call .
whose is it ?
you do what &apos;s right .
let the pieces fall where they fall .
&quot; do what &apos;s right . &quot;
she said she didn &apos;t mean to hurt peter .
she had no idea he &apos;d be having a drink with kent .
what happens to her now ?
got to charge her with attempted murder .
she can &apos;t just walk away from this .
looking good .
feeling even better .
i got a clean bill of health this morning .
you know , there &apos;s a coffee shop a couple blocks away .
i hear they make a pretty nice espresso .
this tastes just fine to me .
oh , come on . you can &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t miss it ...
the imported beans ,
the giant office and swanky suite .
all right , i &apos;m gonna humor you for a second .
what if i went corporate right after college ?
best @-@ case scenario ... i became a millionaire .
sounds like a pretty good scenario .
mm , one with a flip side . what if i never joined the fbi ?
would have made my life a lot easier .
mine too .
but what if 12 years ago
i was never assigned to an art @-@ gallery scam downtown ?
what if ...
i never met this assistant manager ?
no , there are more important things in life than a nice view .
like having people in your life you care about .
i don &apos;t wanna imagine that i &apos;d be without those people .
i like the man i am .
&quot; do what &apos;s right . &quot;
yeah .
you lied to me about the music box .
i know you still have it .
how did you find out ...
mozzie found the sheet music . it wasn &apos;t hard from there .
you want to talk about it ?
if you &apos;re ready to listen .
i want to see it .
i didn &apos;t tell you everything ...
for your own protection .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re gonna do , and neither do you .
i know my options .
revenge or justice , right ?
neal ...
as long as i &apos;m involved , it &apos;s going to be the latter .
what if justice isn &apos;t good enough ?
it has to be .
it will be .
what &apos;d you find ?
there &apos;s a piece of the box that &apos;s still missing ...
right here .
now , at first , i thought
it was one of the cherubs that had broken off .
but if you look more closely , it hasn &apos;t broken off .
it &apos;s a keyhole .
the missing piece is a key .
which you have .
no more secrets , peter .
