doctor sullivan .
she &apos;s not here .
looks like she didn &apos;t come home last night , either .
i walked toby outside and
when i came back inside , it was here .
we have five hours to obey our chucky dolls .
when my dad came back to rosewood ,
he hooked up with my mom .
is this true ?
i thought we felt the same way about each other .
you deserved to be with somebody who can be honest with you .
so i &apos;m sorry .
what do you want ?
i think you need to leave hollis .
what were you and noel kahn talking about today ?
the english teacher , the one that you think is so great
is having a thing with one of his students .
aria , have you heard anything about this ?
i &apos;m not leaving hollis , but you are leaving ezra .
if spencer &apos;s parents find out about this ,
they will ruin you .
i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve asked me to do .
those are a set of latitude and longitude coordinates .
dr. sullivan !
there &apos;s something down there .
&quot; a &quot; set us up !
evidence doesn &apos;t lie .
we &apos;ve known all along what the murder weapon was .
tonight we caught you with it .
i wish i could see those bitches right now .
it &apos;s over , jenna .
there &apos;s nothing left that can link us to that night .
she deserved to die like that .
ding , dong , bell ,
somebody help .
pretty little liars have lied yourself .
sneak to the park , dig in the dark .
telling little lies to make their mark .
only an hour and thirty minutes to go .
i think it &apos;s more like two hours ,
but who &apos;s counting ?
how many hours you got left ?
six months .
sure your momma &apos;s not a big @-@ shot lawyer
getting you and your pals community service
for tampering with evidence .
i thought you said they killed somebody .
that &apos;s what the cops think ,
but the cops can &apos;t prove it .
cops are stupid .
we didn &apos;t do anything .
don &apos;t talk to them .
i &apos;ll talk to anybody i want to .
no , you won &apos;t .
and who &apos;s gonna stop me ?
both of you just shut up .
i don &apos;t want to hear it anymore .
did you at least think about my idea ?
it was a bad idea when they arrested us ,
it &apos;s a bad idea now .
we finally have something solid .
why won &apos;t you use it ?
because you can &apos;t make a deal with a rattlesnake .
you can if you have something the rattlesnake wants .
can we stop talking about snakes ?
listen to me .
we &apos;re not going to be making any kind of a deal with &quot; a. &quot;
that &apos;s final .
maybe for you .
the rest of us don &apos;t have lawyers for parents .
meaning what ?
meaning your mom may have gotten us a deal ,
but if they ever figure out a way to charge us for killing ali ,
she &apos;ll throw the rest of us under the bus to save you ...
and you &apos;d let her .
you guys , stop !
whoa ! spencer , stop !
can you at least try to be civil to her ?
i am civil .
hanna , when you and emily walk into the same room
the smoke alarms go off .
if emily &apos;s parents had taken her back to texas ,
the plea bargain would have fallen apart ,
you might have gone to jail .
whatever it is that happened between the two of you--
have you talked to dad since the big event ?
yes .
he still seems mad when he talks to me .
because he &apos;s angry .
he &apos;s angry , isabel &apos;s angry--
i &apos;m still trying to figure out why you did what you did .
i had to stop it .
you stopped the wedding
but you didn &apos;t stop the marriage .
he went back to baltimore and got married anyway .
yeah , in some court justice &apos;s office .
well , at least creepy kate
didn &apos;t get to show off at the reception .
good morning .
good morning , emily .
so , how does it feel to be done with community service ?
almost done .
there was a problem in the park .
spencer and i have to do an extra two weeks .
well , maybe then things can get back to normal for all of you .
i don &apos;t really know what normal is anymore .
having you and hanna under the same roof ,
i know how hard this has been for both of you .
i hate to see the four of you drifting apart .
i was really hoping there &apos;s be some kind of ...
thaw by now .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s something hanna and the other girls want .
fax is for you .
so , you like this guy ?
he &apos;s okay .
i mean , he &apos;s really old , but he &apos;s not a jerk .
he doesn &apos;t make those listening noises like my first therapist .
he dialed down my meds ,
and he doesn &apos;t look at me like i &apos;m a bobblehead
the way i catch mom and dad sometimes .
they do not look at you like you &apos;re a bobblehead .
really ? i still catch them looking .
and you too .
well , we just want you to be okay .
that &apos;s tough to do with people
waiting for you to turn into a zombie or something .
hmm . that &apos;s funny .
i always saw you as more of the cute werewolf type .
hello .
hey , mike . aria .
hi .
haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
i don &apos;t really get over to hollis anymore .
have things to do around here .
so , i still have that ivy dunbar book that you lent me .
the essays . i know that you said it &apos;s pretty rare ,
so you probably want that back .
no , it &apos;s okay .
no rush . as long as i know you have it .
i do . i really like her writing .
yeah . i knew you would .
mike , would you-- would you go ... ?
sure .
how are you ?
numb .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
aria
no .
i can &apos;t handle it .
my mom thinking that you were with spencer--
don &apos;t worry , she hasn &apos;t told anybody .
the trouble with the police--
i can &apos;t let anything bad happen to you .
aria , something bad has happened .
you won &apos;t let me see you--
well ... we gotta go .
yeah , i gotta go too .
it was great seeing you , mike .
mr. fitz .
bye .
bye .
what do you mean you &apos;re not coming ?
i &apos;m here.i &apos;m waiting for you .
um , i should probably go . we &apos;ll talk later .
are you back for more drivers ed ?
uh , actually i was hoping to see jenna ,
but she &apos;s staying home today .
you two make an interesting couple .
has anybody ever mentioned that ?
i mean , i liked it better
when you guys were keeping it a big secret .
now all the mystery &apos;s gone .
it was never secret . it was private .
when the time was right ,
we let people know .
yeah , well , timing is everything .
you keep saying things to me
like they &apos;re supposed to mean something .
no , no , just that it &apos;s interesting ,
you know , the timing of things .
like the shovel that killed ali turns up ,
and all of a sudden you two are holding hands in the town square .
look , just because two things happen at the same time
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re connected .
well , you know all about things being connected , don &apos;t you ?
again , is that supposed to mean something ?
you know all about connections .
like you &apos;re connected to jenna
and ian and jason ...
almost like you guys are members of the same club .
hey , where is jason , anyways ?
nobody &apos;s seen him since the night we were arrested .
he was at the police station ,
and then all of a sudden he &apos;s gone ...
you were there that night .
do you have any ideas ?
maybe he got tired of you and your friends
and he just went away ... like dr. sullivan .
all my blood levels are good ,
the ulcer &apos;s completely under control .
i &apos;m totally okay to swim again .
see ? no exercise restrictions .
that &apos;s really great , emily .
i can be at practice tomorrow .
i hope we can work something out .
it &apos;s already worked out .
i &apos;ve got a clean bill of health .
you &apos;ve got it right in your hand .
it &apos;s not just about your health , emily .
being on a team is a privilege , not a right .
you know what i &apos;m talking about , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m almost finished with community service .
we have to think about what it means to the team--
the sort of signal it sends
to the other schools if we let you back .
what exactly are you telling me ?
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not my call .
i have to talk to the principal .
i &apos;m sorry .
um , this is my extra @-@ credit report on vonnegut .
thank you .
so it &apos;s okay ?
i look forward to reading it .
hey !
sorry .
stop it !
i &apos;m tired of making allowances for you guys .
you &apos;re supposed to be friends . now go sit down .
it &apos;s the first time i see him in a week
and i can &apos;t say anything .
because of mike ?
no , &apos; cause i just ... i can &apos;t .
there was nothing you could do .
you had to break up with him .
i know .
we &apos;ve all got somebody we want to protect from &quot; a. &quot;
and on top of all that ,
you &apos;ve got jackie the ex to worry about .
what did he ever see in her , anyway ?
i have no idea .
maybe she was a late @-@ onset psycho .
well , we &apos;ll take care of jackie ,
but right now we just have to do what spencer said ,
just slay one dragon at a time . okay ?
okay .
hey . i found another one .
oh , no .
what can i say ,
you were on the side of the road for a month
and there are a lot of cellphones in the world .
people take pictures .
but why do they have to take pictures of me
in an orange jumpsuit picking up beer cans ?
this one wasn &apos;t so bad .
you looked at them ? !
i have to look at them if
i &apos;m gonna find them and get them taken down .
show &apos; em to me .
no , no . don &apos;t show them to me .
okay , let me look .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , nothing .
oh , god , i look like a demented creamsicle .
it &apos;ll be down by tomorrow .
look , you have been amazing ,
and i &apos;m so , so grateful to you ,
but you &apos;re never gonna find all of these , are you ?
look on the bright side . it is the internet ,
you &apos;re up against talking dogs
and people eating bits of sofa cushion--
it &apos;s way more interesting than a pretty girl in an orange baggie .
i do not look pretty in these pictures .
you do . sort of .
in a post @-@ apocalyptic- rag @-@ tag @-@ band @-@ of @-@ survivors kind of way .
okay , now you &apos;re just trying to make me feel better .
and how is that working ?
surprisingly well .
i thought it was a good way to talk about architecture in context .
i mean , people lived in these buildings .
it was the real world for them .
anything that gets people reading henry james is
fine by me .
yeah , and we could combine classes .
we &apos;ll show &apos; em &quot; the heiress . &quot;
count me in .
is everything okay ?
i never used to wince when my phone went off .
now i &apos;ve got judges and lawyers on my speed @-@ dial .
it &apos;s a different world .
how are you holding up ?
one day at a time .
families get through much worse than this .
everybody &apos;s been very polite about what happened ,
very sympathetic ... and i hate it .
i know that underneath it they &apos;re just glad
it wasn &apos;t their kid that got in trouble .
i guess ... i know aria well enough to believe
that she would never do anything to hurt you and ella .
well , nobody starts out to hurt anybody .
no . no , they don &apos;t .
you should come back over . we &apos;ll finish that dinner .
and that scotch .
i would love it .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to ella .
great .
you okay ?
yeah .
you stopped picking up your cell ,
and i didn &apos;t want to call the house .
well , my folks are in philadelphia with melissa .
something wrong ?
they wanted her to see a specialist .
there &apos;s something irregular about her heart rate ,
so she &apos;s having tests done .
you okay out here alone ?
yeah .
you &apos;re finished with community service , right ?
well , no . they tacked on two more weeks .
why ?
because emily and i had a fight .
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re best friends .
i &apos;m getting really tired of people telling me who my friends are .
two weeks is close enough .
that &apos;s beautiful .
i made it for you .
i can &apos;t take it .
why not ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
i told you the night they arrested you ,
i &apos;m not walking away .
do you hear what you just said ?
the night that i was arrested ?
i don &apos;t care .
well , i do ! please , toby , i do .
you have to stay away from me !
i can handle your father .
this isn &apos;t about my father .
then what is it ?
i don &apos;t want you &quot; handling &quot; my father .
i don &apos;t want to have to look over my shoulder and find you there .
what i want is for you to forget about me .
if you really want to worry about somebody ,
why don &apos;t you worry about
your sister and that cop boyfriend of hers ?
&quot; you were always my favorite .
want to make a deal ? &quot;
&quot; a &quot; took the bait .
we pulled it off .
&quot; a &quot; totally think we &apos;re not friends anymore .
they think that we have real evidence .
does it bother anybody that we don &apos;t actually have anything ,
we &apos;re just making it up ?
but jenna and garrett don &apos;t know that .
i don &apos;t know . it just scares me that emily &apos;s doing this alone .
no , no . she &apos;s not gonna be alone .
we &apos;ll be outside .
yeah , but it &apos;s just the four of us .
hanna , every time we ask someone for help ,
they end up collateral damage .
like dr. sullivan .
or a traitor , like garrett .
it was so creepy to have to talk to him ,
but it was totally worth it to rattle the cage .
so tomorrow .
and everyone that &apos;s watching is going to believe
that emily totally went rogue
and that she wants the box that jason gave me .
the one with the evidence ...
that doesn &apos;t really exist .
are you sure that &quot; a &quot; is gonna follow emily ?
absolutely .
i &apos;m the weakest link .
and the weakest link wants some payback .
so what &apos;s the difference between a comic book and a graphic novel ?
about 12.98 .
did you miss me ?
玫瑰镇高中鲨鱼队对阵罗林斯高中
he follows her around like a trained monkey .
it &apos;s worse when he comes to the house .
i didn &apos;t see jenna . is she here ?
must be in the girls &apos; room .
still supporting the sharks ?
they &apos;re swimming against rollins high .
thought i &apos;d make some noise .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
what the hell is going on with spencer ?
you &apos;ll have to talk to her about that .
she &apos;s not talking .
i really can &apos;telp you with spencer . sorry .
emily .
don &apos;t you shut me out , too .
i &apos;m not shutting you out .
it &apos;s just not good for any of us right now , toby .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;ve got a very short memory .
we had a deal . you were going to stay away from him .
i did stay away from him . we broke up .
i &apos;m just returning a book .
returning a book . i saw .
look , i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t leave it . i was taking it with me .
i can show this to your father too .
you think i won &apos;t do what i promised ?
this is your game . you picked the rules .
she said she &apos;d destroy you .
she &apos;d go to my dad , and he &apos;d have you fired .
at least i know why you broke up with me .
you know , before jackie , i don &apos;t think i understood how ...
how dangerous it was what we were doing .
did you stop because of jackie ?
or because you were afraid ?
i was afraid for you .
i didn &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
i should have told your mother
the truth about us at the police station .
you tried .
i should have tried harder .
but i saw that look in her eye ,
that steely &quot; i know what you &apos;ve done &quot; look ,
and i folded .
i know that look .
i have to go .
aria .
i &apos;m not gonna let jackie destroy anything or anybody .
she means what she said .
you still trust me ?
yeah , i do .
then there &apos;s something you and i need to do this afternoon .
you &apos;re missing all the action .
too much chlorine .
you allergic ?
intolerant . there &apos;s supposed to be a difference .
hey , listen , i wanted to say thank you
for keeping an eye on hanna while i was away .
how &apos;s california ?
different .
and the new family ?
i still sort of feel like a foreign exchange student ,
but i like them .
and they seem to like me , so ...
what &apos;s not to like ?
so , are you going back for good ?
hmm . it &apos;s complicated .
my mom gave up her parental rights .
you can &apos;t just change that .
well , that &apos;s what lawyers are for .
i thought i would stay here and finish out the school year .
and then what ?
figure it out when i finish .
but hey , if you can &apos;t put me up ,
i &apos;ll totally figure something out .
no , you &apos;re more than welcome to stay with me .
i was just wondering how long you &apos;d be around .
so , have you thought about the future ?
lucas , i owe you a lot ,
but right now you &apos;re talking like a guidance counselor .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
what do you mean ?
if you hadn &apos;t talked me into coming back to town ,
none of this would have happened .
yeah , that thought did occur to me .
if i make plans , you &apos;ll know about them .
i &apos;m not the one you need to keep in your plans .
don &apos;t worry about hanna , okay ?
hey , it &apos;s last event , the last heat .
where is aria ? we said that we were gonna do this together .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s complicated .
so is this .
i &apos;m here , okay ?
okay , it &apos;s every man for himself .
i want the box that jason gave aria .
well , you &apos;re not gonna get it .
guys , spencer &apos;s only looking out for herself .
we have to cut a deal with
shut up , emily .
where is it ?
it &apos;s safe .
where ?
don &apos;t tell her .
it &apos;s hidden ,
and it stays hidden until i want it found .
you forget ,
we all learned how to keep secrets from the same person .
i bet i know where it is .
good luck .
let &apos;s get out of here .
i wanted to clarify something .
we wanted to tell you something important .
i &apos;m in love with your daughter .
i love aria .
we met before school started this year .
mike , you should go back upstairs .
i wanted you to know that
this started before aria was assigned to my class .
what started ?
wait ,
what do you mean , before she was &quot; assigned &quot; to your class ?
she wasn &apos;t my student ... then .
she wasn &apos;t your student then ?
this can &apos;t be true .
it is . really .
i love him .
this was going on ...
this happened while you were her teacher ?
yes .
do you understand what your saying ?
yes , i do .
no , i don &apos;t think you do ,
because if you did ,
you wouldn &apos;t be standing here .
you wouldn &apos;t dare !
aria , go upstairs .
take mike with you .
no .
no , i &apos;m staying here .
if this is true , what you &apos;re telling us ...
it is .
no !
what i &apos;m hoping can happen is that--
no . what is gonna happen is ,
you are gonna leave this house right now .
mr. montgomery
end of conversation .
dad , just
aria , no .
byron .
i am not asking you .
i am telling you .
mike !
maybe you should go .
you knew about this ?
i did not know about &quot; this . &quot;
i thought i knew about spencer hastings .
spencer .
yes . i saw them together , and--
you heard the same rumors i did .
and you talked to him about spencer ?
yes .
and he lied to your face .
well , maybe i didn &apos;t give him a chance to tell me the truth .
well , this is not about telling the truth .
this is about what he did . he &apos;s finished .
the man is finished .
well , i suppose he is .
you suppose ?
you were here , you heard what he said .
of course i did .
when what &apos;s left to suppose ?
it &apos;s just i realize that this happened when we came home .
that has nothing to do with this .
i &apos;m just trying to understand what she was thinking
by getting involved with a teacher .
well , this is not about what she was thinking .
this is about what he did .
we &apos;re talking about someone
who should have known better .
it shouldn &apos;t have started ,
but it was his responsibility to stop it .
can i say something , please ?
of course you can .
don &apos;t make up your minds right now .
you can &apos;t figure out in one night
what i &apos;m still trying to understand myself .
i love you ...
so much .
i love him too .
so please , just--
just imagine for one minute that this is real ,
because it is , i swear that it is .
just go to your room , aria .
dad .
mom .
go ... upstairs .
don &apos;t be angry .
angry doesn &apos;t begin to describe how i feel about you right now .
who said you could come in ?
ezra , you were making a terrible mistake .
i had to do something to wake you up
to what was happening .
bad idea to wake a sleepwalker .
what happened to your lip ?
you told her parents .
did professor montgomery hit you ?
no , that &apos;s what her brother brought to the party .
what did you expect was gonna happen ?
go away , jackie .
she &apos;s a teenager ...
and you were her teacher .
get out .
there &apos;s nothing i want from you .
and i will not let you do anything to her .
so get out .
emily left ten minutes ago . i &apos;m almost at the door .
i &apos;m going now .
i &apos;m trying to think of what we &apos;re forgetting to bring .
i think we &apos;re all set . i &apos;ll see you soon .
okay .
hanna ...
you can &apos;t go anywhere right now .
your father &apos;s on his way over .
he wants to talk to us together .
you want to give me a hard time , that &apos;s one thing ,
but you can &apos;t treat emily like that .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
what is going on is between emily and me ,
so just forget it .
forget it ?
i &apos;m just gonna watch two people i care about
rip into each other ?
right . i &apos;m gonna do that .
for everybody &apos;s sake , just stay out of it !
stay out of what , spencer ?
after everything that &apos;s happened ,
how can you just stand there and tell me there &apos;s something
i &apos;m not supposed to know about ?
what do i have to do to make you leave me alone ?
tell me about the night you found the shovel .
i told you . i told you what happened .
yeah , you said somebody tricked you into finding it ,
and i believe you , but ever since that night ,
the four of you have been acting like ...
acting like what ?
like ali is still running things ,
playing you against each other .
today at school ,
you sounded just like ali when you talked to emily .
jenna always said that you wanted to take ali down ,
replace her .
i didn &apos;t think that was true until today .
it &apos;s not like that .
then what is it like ?
i can &apos;do this ! don &apos;t ask me !
spencer--
no ! don &apos;t ask me now ! ask me after tonight .
what difference is one night gonna make ?
it could change everything , but i need you to let me go .
and i need you to promise that you won &apos;t follow me .
congratulations again on getting married .
thank you .
well , at least now you won &apos;t have to send back all your gifts .
hanna .
sorry .
you &apos;re not the only one that &apos;s angry here , hanna .
there &apos;s plenty of that to go around .
that &apos;s something we &apos;re gonna deal with ,
and we &apos;re gonna deal with it as a family .
which family ?
that &apos;s one of the things we &apos;re gonna work on ,
which is why i wanted to talk to you at the same time , in person .
i made some arrangements , we &apos;re moving back to rosewood .
&quot; we &quot; ?
me , isabel , kate .
kate &apos;s going to be in rosewood ?
is she going to school here ?
yes , she is .
dad , how could you do that to me ?
because he loves you ...
and this way he can be near you .
isn &apos;t that right , tom ?
oh , my god . he told your parents ?
yeah .
what happened ?
they sent me to my room .
no . no , this is not good .
i &apos;ll get out somehow . where &apos;s hanna ?
on her way , i hope .
are you going to see him ?
no .
but i have to get out .
you better go this way .
there &apos;s handholds .
you &apos;re gonna have to drop the last four feet , though .
is this how you sneak out of the house ?
it &apos;s been my escape route for years .
look , mike , what &apos;s going on with me and ezra
it &apos;s really--
stop .
look , i &apos;m sorry i hit him .
but when i saw dad &apos;s face ,
i figured better i do it than him .
i knew you &apos;d be here .
i knew i could depend on you .
you listen to us .
you &apos;re always listening .
you know you made a mistake , don &apos;t you ?
it must be driving you crazy .
you &apos;re afraid we found something ,
something in this box .
something about you .
do you want to know what we found ?
do you want to see what you &apos;re afraid of ?
nothing .
we found nothing .
we lied to you , and you believed us .
that was your mistake .
no ! no !
emily !
are you okay ?
you guys , come on !
hanna !
my god , i don &apos;t believe this !
hey . you okay ?
yeah , i think so .
did i just hit what i think i did ?
yes !
and now they &apos;re gone !
we &apos;ve got nothing !
we &apos;ve got nothing !
was it garrett or jenna ?
how could it be jenna ?
i couldn &apos;t tell .
well , was it a boy or a girl ?
i don &apos;t know !
any sense of boobs ?
hanna .
what ? it could be a clue .
that &apos;s not mine .
it &apos;s not mine .
it &apos;s none of ours .
do you think when &quot; a &quot; bounced off the car ...
