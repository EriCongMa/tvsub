"RUN BABY RUN"
Now Mr. Linzer hates the food,
so he will tell you he feels fine.
He does not feel fine.
And if you release him before his I.N.R. stabilizes,
he will bleed to death.
Murphy's gonna keep an eye on him.
I am gonna keep an eye on him.
Mrs. Gellman's still intubated,
but I want the tube out by monday.
Have the nurses page you as soon as she starts breathing on her--
I-I will ask them myself.
Oh, it's not too much for you?
Not at all.
And yet, you're trying to fob it off to petunia here,
with her years and years of experience in critical care.
I want you to relax on your honeymoon.
I thought that you'd be reassured
by having two sets of eyes on your patients.
The notion of an intern handling my patients
is the best way I can think of
to ruin a perfectly good mai tai.
Oh, are you going someplace warm?
We don't have to talk about it.
Oh, no. I want to talk to you about my honeymoon--
The hotel, the sights...
I'm gonna handle Mrs. Gellman myself.
What I'm wearing on the plane, what I'm wearing on the beach.
Leah, leave.
And the wedding--should I get my nails done today
or tomorrow on my way to the ceremony?
Okay, she's gone. I got this.
The adrenal system reacts to stress
by releasing hormones that makes us alert and reactive.
The problem is,
the adrenal system can't tell what's a regular case of nerves
and what's a real impending disaster.
Yo, Lefkowitz.
Did you bring it?
That's the whole thing? Yep.
Lefkowitz has gastroparesis
so he can't digest his food.
He was an epic puker for a long time,
and now he can't really eat at all.
So we're gonna give you a gastric neurostimulator.
This thing, it's gonna zap your stomach
so it remembers
to push the food down your system.
Get you back on burgers and fries.
That's amazing.
Yeah, well, the guys at the airport x-ray are gonna go nuts.
That's sick.
Oh, uh, this is Dr. Wilson.
She's gonna be operating with me.
You've got a-a crack team, iron man.
Hey.
Don't.
All right, all right. All right.
I'll stop. I'll stop.
Jeez.
When you and Arizona get to the wedding tomorrow...
Mm-hmm.
Don't sit down.
What do you mean, don't sit down?
Just find a place and stand there.
You want us to stand in the back?
Then we won't be able to hear anything.
Stand in the damn front.
And block everybody's view?
I mean, if we're-- I don't--
Just pick a spot.
You know, it's not complicated. Ugh!
You know, people allow you to open them up with a knife.
If they knew you couldn't follow a simple instruction,
they would run like the wind from this place.
Are you...
Are you trying to say, "Would you do me the honor
of being mbridesmaids?"
Does the whole thing have to be about you?
Just put on a dress and don't sit down.
Aww. We're bridesmaids.
Oh, don't even---
Ju--ju--see? Ugh.
This is what I was trying to avoid.
Now once I remove the sural nerve from your leg,
Dr. Torres will graft it on to Dr. Shepherd's median nerve.
You'll likely experience some discomfort
in your leg for a few weeks--
Months. Months.
And when he says "Discomfort," It's gonna hurt like hell.
Well, you're a bag of sunshine, aren't you?
I don't want to hear six months from now
that you can't move
and that the ibuprofen hurts your stomach.
He makes me sound like I'm a 90-year-old man.
Have you noticed that?
Because I've heard for decades how I ruined your life...
Because you did.
And that mom doesn't love you.
Because she doesn't.
I don't want to hear about this.
I think what you're trying to say is "Thank you, Lizzie,
for cutting off a leg and giving it to me."
Ah. Here it is. This is how it's gonna go down in history.
It is a nerve. It is not the entire leg.
Okay. Let's focus. Jackson.
Um, I think Dr. Shepherd's right.
If you're unsure, we--
Oh, come on.
I'm just winding him up because it is so easy.
Just give me the form.
Okay.
Now can I go hang out with Zola in day care?
Oh, I'm sorry.
They don't let the adults come and go
because it's harder on the kids.
I will bring her to you later.
Grey.
Uh, when you get to the wedding tomorrow,
don't sit down.
The lawyer put together the papers.
They're gonna send them over tomorrow.
Oh, I signed a bunch of stuff with them last week.
Uh, not the plane crash. The divorce.
Oh.
That was fast.
I said we wanted to move quickly.
Apparently.
It's all done. You just have to sign.
Is that a problem?
Nope.
Tomorrow, with a pen.
Okay.
Everything off from the waist down.
Nice paper tablecloth for you. I'll be right back.
You know, I was thinking about telling Lizzie
if you're okay with that.
I think it's still kind of early.
Yeah, but she's doing this thing for me.
She'll tell your whole entire family.
Well, you told Cristina.
I haven't.
Still?
There's no point.
I'm probably gonna miscarry anyway.
Meredith...
I am just stating the facts.
I have a very unstable uterus.
This baby has an uphill climb.
I am just being realistic.
Ready to take a look?
Yeah.
Okay, scoot down.
Now there's still a lot we can do
to support the pregnancy, right,
even with our history?
Of course. You've got some risk factors.
But we're gonna watch you like a hawk.
Okay.
There we go.
Hi, baby.
Good news.
Arizona and I both have red dresses.
Now they're not the same, but they are similar.
So it's not like matchy-matchy, but it'll be super cute.
Now which part of my face says I want super cute?
Get over it already. It's a wedding.
No one cares that it's your second other than you.
Just hold your nose. It'll be over in a few hours.
Sure. And then we'll be married.
And, oh, him in L.A., me here with my son
and a job that's known to take up a great deal of time.
Oh, and he's an intern,
because one specialty wasn't enough for him.
Let's get to that part.
You know, everyone's acting like I'm some jittery bride.
Maybe I have something to jitter about.
Well...
If it's the marriage you're really worried about...
you can run.
Excuse me?
Leave him at the altar. It's a clean break.
He's so pissed that you stood him up
in front of all his people, the whole thing is just over.
And then you're not wrestling with a relationship
that's doomed or tied to someone for the rest of your life.
I mean, sure, you love each other now.
But the next thing you know,
you are cleaning his pee off the ground
and going to bed with a foot-wide demilitarized zone
down the middle of the bed.
Kidding.
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
No, it...it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
Yeah, Ben's the...
The best. He's...
He...
We have to do an open procedure 'cause he's got adhesions
from a surgery a couple years ago.
Once he's open,
you can take down the adhesions.
Really?
Yeah.
I've never done anything like that before.
Yeah, well, if it was me,
I'd spend the next few hours in the skills lab.
Dr. Karev.
Is this because I told you about when I was a kid?
Oh, yeah. I feel so bad you were a dumpster-diving orphan,
I'm letting you hack up a 10 year old.
Sorry. Stupid.
Ya think?
Flowers, music...
It's a recipe for disaster.
April, you're going to be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, come on. Don't tell her she's gonna be fine.
You're gonna be looking all pretty,
little bit of lip gloss on your prude-y little mouth.
Jackson will spot her across the room.
Try to look away, but he can't.
You're irresistible in your dress.
One drink, and you're doing the hippity-dippity
in the coat room.
The dress? Oh, god.
See?
Cruel.
What?
Nothing.
So he's into you now?
Karev? No.
Then why's he letting you take down adhesions?
Have you ever removed adhesions?
No. None of us have.
Hey, Wilson.
Uh, where are Sujin Kim's post-op notes?
I didn't finish it.
I wanted to practice for this gastric neurostimulator surgery
I'm doing with Dr. Karev.
She's taking down the adhesions.
Really? Oh.
Good for you. He must really trust you.
I hope you're not using blunt dissection,
'cause that'll tear it.
You want nice, precise moves with the instruments.
Okay.
You sure you're ready for this?
Yeah. You want me to get you that chart?
No. It can wait.
You should practice.
See? She shouldn't even be doing a move like this.
He's into her.
The last thing you want at your wedding
is to wonder if Mr. Linzer is circling the drain
just because nobody was monitoring his I.N.R.
So I'll just stick around here tomorrow
and keep an eye on him.
Kepner, you broke up with Avery.
I-- yes.
Yes. I-I don't know what that has to--
You're afraid that the sight
of me in cream colored raw silk
will bring tears to your eyes.
I am sure that you will be beautiful--
I look at my father, he kisses me on the cheek,
I turn away from him,
take a breath.
Dr. Webber.
I step towards Ben...
And you and Jackson lock eyes from across the room.
You melt into him like snow in the rain.
I knew you would understand.
Suck it up, Kepner.
If I have to go, you have to go.
Okay.
"If I have to go, you have to go"?
Oh, drop it.
Oh, no.
That's the most beautiful sentiment I've ever heard.
Lizzie's calves are a little shorter
than we anticipated.
Tall girl, short calves.
So is that gonna be a problem?
No, not if we just get
a little more nerve from the other leg.
Are you saying to-- no.
Derek.
Absolutely not.
No, I never liked this idea in the first place.
We find another donor or we don't do it.
Well, we couldn't find another donor.
That's why we--
Well, then we're out of luck.
Can't we just--
No, we can't.
We're not gonna talk about this.
We're not gonna float this past Lizzie.
We're not cutting both her legs to remove pieces.
Cancel the procedure.
I think you should bring a date to Dr. Bailey's wedding.
That way we will focus on our dates
and not on each other.
Or we could just be focused on the happy couple.
I am wearing a strapless dress.
From here up, I'm completely naked.
Just... wear a different dress.
I don't have a different dress.
I work long hours. I don't shop.
I have--I have one dressy dress.
How am I supposed to find a date with one day's notice?
Stephanie. Hey.
Um, would you like to go to Dr. Bailey's wedding?
Oh, what?
Dr. Avery would love for you to go with him.
That's not true.
He thinks that you'd be embarrassed,
but you're not embarrassed, are you?
Of course she's embarrassed.
She'll get over it.
Look, don't get other--
Strapless...
and tight.
I will pick you up at 1:00 tomorrow
in the locker room.
What just happened?
What about you?
You got to pick mine, so I get to pick yours, right?
Jackson.
What about Shane?
He's a good-looking piece of man, huh?
They're that short?
No, they're perfectly respectable calves.
It's just that we're not gonna get quite enough nerve
from just the one.
Okay.
I know it's a lot to ask.
No, it's, uh, fine. Do what you need to do.
Derek thinks it's too much to ask,
but he really needs this,
so if he comes to you and tries to talk you out of it,
you have to push.
But don't tell him that I'm the one that came to you,
because he won't like that.
You've got some balls, don't you?
You know, if it's too much, we can call the whole thing off.
You know we're family, right?
There was no wedding, Meredith.
You adopted a baby
and you never invited us to come meet her.
You never accepted our invitation to come see us.
All we got was a couple of pictures via e-mail.
You know, my kids were so excited that for months,
they walked around telling every African-American person they saw
that we have a brown baby in the family?
A year later, they kind of think I made the whole thing up.
I'm sorry. It's just, you know,
with everything that's been going on--
No, I get that we're all busy,
but you're not shy about asking me for a couple of body parts,
and now you want me to cover your tracks with Derek?
If you feel like it's inappropriate, we--
No, it's what sisters ask sisters to do.
We cover each other's asses.
Look, if you want to be a sister,
I am delighted, but then act like one.
My version of family isn't like your version.
You guys give each other crap and then you laugh about it.
You'd walk through fire for each other.
Greys are not like that.
Derek said you had a sister who worked here.
Half.
She was on the plane?
You know, I-I really don't want to talk about my sister.
My husband really needs this, so you don't have to like me,
just--just him.
You have a child.
She's part of my family.
You of all people should realize,
you need spares in a family.
You need as many as you can get.
It was very nice to talk to you, Lizzie.
I stashed a little Johnnie in case the ceremony's got
some cousin reading a poem.
Right.
Uh, I meant to find you.
I'm kind of bringing a date.
Yeah, me.
Two guys picking up bridesmaids from out of town.
April's convinced that if we don't both bring dates,
then we're both gonna end up...
Why you gotta talk to her?
She ruins everything.
How about I find someone for you to go with?
You know, maybe Stephanie has a friend.
Stephanie? That's who you're taking?
You want a date or not?
No.
All right.
Okay. Whatever.
Just don't get me an ugly one.
We're not doing the procedure.
Of course we're doing it.
You know what happened when I said I'd do this?
Mom called me three times in one day.
It just brings tears to my eyes.
She's a mess.
Come on. You're the golden child.
The rest of us are just scrapping for second position,
and I just put a lock on it for life.
You think I'm giving that up
just 'cause you have to cut into two legs instead of one?
Lizzie--
No, we're not discussing it. I've decided.
Get back on the horse, Derek.
Oh, okay. So you think I'm using this as an excuse,
that I'm too scared to try and operate again?
No, of course not. Nothing scares you.
What if it doesn't work?
What if we go through all of this
and nothing comes of it?
Well, then at least we tried.
We're doing it. Just... say thank you.
You ready?
Yep.
Bovie, please.
Thank you.
Okay, here?
Yep.
Take your time.
Okay.
Watch out for the blood vessels.
Wow. Look at you, all grown-up.
Up in the skills lab, I was doing--
You put a hole in his stomach.
I haven't even--
move, now. Move. All right. Clamp.
Here you go.
2.0 vicryl.
I'll get it.
Suction.
Hey, Steph.
You okay there?
Fine.
Terrific.
I wanted to ask you--
I was gonna go to the wedding with,
you know, a friend-- a guy, like, Stag.
Yeah?
And now he feels like I'm bailing on him.
You don't have to go with me.
No, no. You don't want to go?
You have a date with guy.
I ditched him, and I want you to find somebody for him.
Is that weird?
Nothing about this is weird.
Terrific.
There's still some spillage.
Give me some lap pads...
And some 2.0 silk.
Get over here and grab the retractor
so we can put the device back in.
Wilson.
I can't get my hands to stay still.
Well, shake it off and get over here.
The kid's gonna be fine,
just grab the damn retractor.
Get out.
Go!
You think Bailey will notice if I'm not there?
She just made you a bridesmaid.
Oh, she doesn't care about all of that.
She just wants a bunch of people standing up there
so it won't look weird
When Ben has all his guys standing up there.
And I have a packed day tomorrow.
Yeah, 'cause you're going to a wedding.
You're supposed to wear heels...
to a fancy occasion.
Oh, come on.
No, they make you feel tall and confident
and feminine and--
And my plastic foot isn't the right shape for... heels.
I didn't get that kind.
Well, I mean--
It's not nothing.
I mean, why do you think women all over the world wear them?
Because women all over the world are stupid.
Oh, okay. So you're gonna wear flats?
Oh, I'd be happy to wear flats.
Oh, no, you wouldn't because then you would feel dumpy.
Oh-ho. Did you just call me dumpy?
Can you just for one second admit
that you know what it is I'm talking about?
Okay, I know it's hard.
It's hard all the time,
and this is just one more reminder.
But you are so, so beautiful.
Yeah, people stand next to you
and immediately feel bad about themselves.
It's a public service
that you're a couple of inches shorter.
It is a kindness to every other woman at that wedding
that you are just one tiny bit less beautiful.
Are you still mad at me because I called Lizzie?
Do you still love me?
Medium.
I just want your hand to be better
so that we can put this stupid plane crash stuff behind us.
Well, the lawyer called to schedule a deposition.
He thinks we have a strong case,
especially now that Cristina and Owen are getting divorced.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, it'd be a big conflict of interest
if Owen was married to one of the plaintiffs.
That's why they got divorced, right?
She didn't tell you?
No. Why would she not tell me that?
You didn't tell her you were pregnant.
Maybe things are different now.
On the morning of your wedding?
Oh, my house is filled with my family
talking about makeup and hair.
Just check into a hotel. Dr. Bailey.
Take a nice long bath, get a manicure.
Oh, now I got you talking about makeup and hair?
Dr. Bailey, what are you doing here?
Checking up on my patients.
Making sure you haven't bungled anything.
Don't mention her hair.
Why? Did something happen to your hair?
He probably knew it was risky,
so he wanted it on me and not him.
You have to stop. You're making yourself crazy.
I'm gonna get fired.
No, you're not.
Just keep your head down and do your work.
You're right. You're right.
Now I have to ask you something,
and in light of the fact
that you think your job is on the line,
it's gonna sound really stupid.
Whatever. It's okay.
Dr. Avery asked me to dr. Bailey's wedding.
And I can't put two words together
into a sentence when I'm within 2 feet of him,
and he's bringing a friend,
and he asked me to bring a friend,
and it'll be like a bunch of us,
and we'll all go together.
You're right. It sounds really stupid.
But will you do it?
Please, Jo.
Somebody page cardio?
Yeah. G.S.W. To the chest.
We put up 2 and a half liters of blood
when we put in the chest tube.
We should move him upstairs.
There is a bullet in the abdomen.
I can do it, or we can call for somebody else.
You can do it. Amicable, right?
Mm-hmm. Let's move.
You're still rechecking Kepner's work?
What I was born to do.
I have a chole in about ten minutes.
In and out, the whole thing should take an hour.
You want to scrub in?
Take the edge off before you go home and get dressed?
You... are a good man.
Dr. Webber.
Oh, the man of the hour.
Oh, tell me you're not here to take me back to that house.
No, I'm--I'm not.
Okay, well, he, um, just asked me to do a chole with him...
And it's the only thing that's calmed me down on a day full of people
trying and failing to calm me down.
Why do you think he asked you?
You called him?
Thank you.
Both of you.
So can I have a car pick you up at the house?
How many times do I have to say no to that?
A person shouldn't drive themselves
to their own wedding.
Well, I like to drive.
In a wedding gown?
Y--it's my last ten minutes as a single woman.
You know, you both were on a roll there.
Why are you trying to screw it up now?
I'll see you in the o.R.
And I will see you
at the altar.
Dr. Robbins.
Yeah. Hi.
Dr. Karev had me take down the adhesions.
Yeah. Yeah, how'd that go?
Some of the adhesions were stuck to the stomach.
The stomach was injured.
He could be septic by now.
I don't think he had any business
having an intern do that kind of move.
I mean, you were pretty shocked to hear that I was doing it.
He threw me in the deep end, probably because--
Okay, hang on.
What exactly are you saying about your attending?
G.S.W.
Sweet.
Scrubbing in with owen,
who wants to sign our divorce papers today.
I guess we're being mature and moving on.
Speaking of which, why didn't you tell me
that the divorce was because of the plane crash lawsuit?
What?
Derek told me, so that the case is stronger.
Which is great, I'm glad,
Especially if it means
the two of you are getting back together.
It's good news, and I don't know
why you wouldn't want to share that with me?
Because I didn't know.
You ready?
What?
Dr. Shepherd's prepped?
Yep.
Uh, Dr. Torres is going over the studies.
Okay.
Hold it together.
Well, a nerve extraction's a pretty simple procedure.
Not that.
He asked me on a date, to dr. Bailey's wedding.
Dr. Kepner asked me.
It's a date?
It's not, like, a mentoring thing?
How is drinking champagne
and dancing to barry white a mentoring thing?
I thought it was, like,
spending time getting to know the interns
in a casual, stress-free environment.
That was the free-doughnuts thing in the lounge.
This is a wedding.
I can't go on a date with my boss.
I need to focus on my work,
not get all wrapped up in the ladies.
Did you really just say "The ladies"?
You're the one who just said
you couldn't concentrate in the O.R.,
cause Dr. Avery might look at you
with his limpid green eyes.
The eyes are really intense.
You've noticed it yourself, right?
Get a grip.
You get a grip.
Karev, did you tell Wilson that
she'd be fired for screwing up a gastric implant?
What?
Is the patient gonna make it?
The patient's fine.
What the hell did she tell you?
She thinks that you set her up
to take the fall on a risky O.R. procedure,
and it kind of sounds like you did.
It would've been risky no matter who did it.
And I was standing right there.
The second it got hairy, I took over.
She was in over her head.
And where do you think I got the idea
to do something like that?
What are you talking about?
You. I'm trying to be like you were with me.
You let me try crap so I got confidence in myself.
That's what I was trying to do,
not treat the stupid morons like the stupid morons that
I think they are.
I gave you opportunities.
I also gave you a boatload of encouragement and support.
I didn't drop-kick you into the deep end of the pool...
and yell, "Swim, idiot."
You're a teacher now.
Your students fail, you've failed.
Glad you're driving yourself to the wedding.
Remind me to stay off the roads.
Were you like this?
On my wedding day,
I remember staring at my socks for a long time.
I had no idea what to do with 'em.
You know, ten years from now,
if the marriage is strong,
I'll look back at today and say...
"It was just a little bit of cold feet."
If we're in a nasty divorce, I'll say,
"I knew it was a mistake the day we got married."
You think it's a mistake?
I just feel...
worried.
I never felt that way with Tucker.
You were a child when you married Tucker.
You're an adult now.
You know the world's an ambiguous place.
You know that love doesn't conquer all.
It conquers some stuff.
The other stuff kicks the living crap out of love.
And this is the pep talk?
Overwhelming doubt is a problem.
A little bit of doubt is just a sign of an intelligent adult.
Is Grey gonna be in the gallery?
No. She didn't want to make you nervous.
I told her you don't get nervous.
You're right. I don't.
Close your eyes.
Enjoy your nap.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Torres.
You've got nothing to worry about.
We good to go?
Yes, we are.
Yes. We're--yes.
Jackson, I just want to let you know,
I'll be here watching the whole time.
Couldn't be happier.
No mistakes.
That's the plan.
Are you kidding me?
Get that woman out of my gallery.
That's not a good idea.
Get her out.
I heard that, Avery.
Edwards, don't even think about it.
Now.
Edwards, you wouldn't dare.
You have years with me.
I can be very difficult to deal with.
15-blade, please.
You narced on me to my boss?
I worked hard to get here.
I'm not gonna let myself get fired because--
Nobody's firing you.
I was trying to help you.
I clearly wasn't ready for it.
Why, because I had to take over?
Look, you can't go crying
to my damn boss every time you get scared.
You can't cry at all when you get scared
because it's scary in there all the time.
I just thought, maybe after I blew the appy,
I'd be a good target
if you needed to pin something on someone.
It's paranoid. I get that.
I don't always trust people who are trying to help me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a beaten dog,
and you bite people who try to feed you.
I don't give a crap about your sad story.
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to get the hell over it.
You burned a bridge with me.
How about you grow up before
you burn a bridge with every other attending
who tries to teach you something?
50 centimeters of prime nerve.
Great.
All right.
Forceps, please. Thank you.
Is no one making small talk
because this is Derek Shepherd on the table?
This is intricate work.
Small talk is what keeps us awake.
Well, uh... a couple of days ago,
I helped Dr. Kepner extract a malignant mass
from the gluteal area of a female patient.
It--it was an impressively sized mass.
Who's gonna tell Dr. Shepherd
that he'll never operate again
because Ross' idea of gossip is,
he saw April Kepner take a lump off an ass?
Brooks, suction.
All of, not half of it.
Sorry.
He's got a bunch of tattoos.
Wonder if it's some sort of a gang thing.
I had--
The chatter isn't helping me,
and your experience with gangland youth
has little bearing on how we treat this patient.
What the hell was that?
I thought this was supposed to be amicable.
We're getting divorced because of the lawsuit?
It will significantly increase your chances--
You didn't want to mention it?
I want you to get the money.
I want all of you to get the money,
and I knew there was a very real chance
that you would reject the idea
simply because I suggested it.
Oh, right. Because I'm so simple-minded and petulant.
You've been known to--
Where do you get off
making some kind of unilateral decision about our marriage?
How about the fact that you moved across the country
and didn't have the courage to do what I did
and simply ask for a divorce?
Oh, god. So this is ballsy,
you hiding behind the lawsuit?
You couldn't just admit to me,
or--or--or god sake, yourself, that you wanted out.
You have to let this stupid plane crash
make the decision for you.
I chose the airline!
You like it better when I decide?!
I chose the airline!
We had to make a budget cut of 4%...
and we had a line item of emergency transportation.
We never used it, and we had a...
fancy charter company,
and I chose a... cheaper one.
You want to know why it was cheaper?
You didn't build the plane.
People are dead.
Or fly it.
I thought you were dead.
You're not responsible.
Someone has to be.
I mean, it takes a lot of small mistakes
to destroy something,
and it's really easy for everybody involved
just to say, "Ah, I just did this one small thing."
A bunch of people made it possible...
for a bad plane to take off
with you, Meredith, and Derek,
and Arizona, and...
And I am one of those people.
I think I'm having a dream
a really hot doctor came to take care of me.
This really hot doctor is leaving you to go to a party.
Callie said it could not have gone better.
Do you have any pain?
No.
How's Lizzie?
Uh, she's doing well.
She was still sleeping last time I checked.
I'll swing by on my way out.
It may have worked.
And we're back on the shoes.
Please don't even say it out loud.
It makes me feel even more stupid.
Just... tell her that I wasn't feeling well.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Do not belittle me, okay? You have no idea what it's like--
Oh, trust me, trust me,
I am intimately familiar with what's going on,
and I'm over it.
You are exactly the same person you were before,
just minus a leg.
You think it's nothing?
No. Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think it's everything.
And--and you know what? It has been... for months.
And I have been supportive for months.
But there comes a point where you have to suck it up
and stop whining and start living.
Okay, so you have one leg.
It's a wedding. It's a wedding.
And weddings are sweet and beautiful
and n-no one's gonna notice the stupid leg
because everybody's gonna be looking at Bailey,
and maybe for one night,
our lives can be about something
other than that damn leg.
My whole life is about that leg.
I haven't had sex in five months because of the leg.
Enough about the leg!
Everything went smoothly. Your vitals look great.
And Derek is awake, and he's in good shape.
Meredith, I'm pushy.
I get that.
Some people find it endearing,
and some people really don't.
But, um... you don't have to want
Derek's truckload of sisters in your life.
Yeah. You are a pain in the ass.
And I barely know you.
Okay, so...
I'm not very good at this.
But I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna show you something,
but you have to promise not to blab it to the whole family.
Okay.
Promise?
Yeah.
Okay.
You?
Really?
We're having a baby.
Let her drive you, Miranda.
No, mom.
I just need five minutes with none of you touching me.
Wh--
So did she bring her friend or what?
Oh, come on.
He's the guy?
Was the lawsuit the only reason you asked for a divorce?
There are many reasons.
You were...
done
a long time ago.
I'm asking about you.
Okay, let me put it another way.
I wanted to--to try again.
I was gonna ask you if we could try again,
and you said, "I want a divorce."
Oh. Sorry.
I should throw this thing out the window.
Hello.
Sir, this is Barrett in the E.R.
Your wife is on her way here,
paramedics say she's vomiting blood.
What?
Adele?
She's hypotensive.
Um, hey, turn the car around.
We need to go to the emergency room...
at Seattle Grace Hospital right now.
Wasn't this stupid thing supposed to start already?
I'm--I'm here, sweetheart.
Why is this happening?
We're gonna find out.
How much blood has she lost?
At least a liter, a liter and a half.
It started about 45 minutes ago.
Oh, God! It hurts.
Hang more L.R.
No, not if she's lost that much blood.
She needs a transfusion and an N.G.Tube.
I've got this, okay?
Sir, she's your wife. Step back.
Get me an N.G.Tube, son.
I can do this.
Get me an N.G.Tube right now.
Okay, I got it.
You hear me?
Get out of the way.
Okay. Central line kit, please.
Yes, doctor.
Yeah, yeah, Leah. Get me out of this dress now.
Adele, hi.
Can you look at me?
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you, okay?
She's having ventricular couplets.
All right, watch for v-tach.
Prep the I.J.
Okay, you're gonna be fine, baby. We got you.
All right. Get the guide wire ready.
She's losing consciousness, Bailey!
Damn it. All right.
Uh, Barrett, take this. Do a femoral line instead.
Uh, Leah, intubation tray.
Oh, God, Adele.
Oh, God.
Oh, come on, come on, come on.
Oh, straight to voice mail.
Um, it's possible that I may have, by mistake,
said that if she had any doubts, she should flee.
What?
Why?
Well, I kind of said that marriage is like a dance of death,
and that leaving him at the altar
would be a painful but efficient out.
Oh, that's nice.
I was joking... ohh.
And she was nervous, okay?
And she wasn't sure if it was the wedding or the whole thing.
The marriage?
She was nervous.
How nervous?
How nervous was she, Callie?
The body doesn't know the difference
between nerves and excitement, panic and doubt,
the beginning, and the end.
The body just tells you to get the hell out.
Sometimes you ignore it.
That's the reasonable thing to do.
But sometimes you listen.
You're supposed to trust your gut, right?
When your body says run...
