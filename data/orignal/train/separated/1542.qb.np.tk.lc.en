sweet old lady .

little overweight .
no idea where that came from .
thick irish accent .
i panicked !
i should have told the truth ,
but claire knows i have ... a type .
it was just a little white lie .
ironically .
hey , america !
i didn &apos;t see you there .
welcome to another live webcast of &quot; jay talking . &quot;
杰 · 普里契特
you know what really gets my goat ?
goat cheese .
it &apos;s on everything .
i hate it .
the only thing worse than goat cheese
is eating it at a communal table
with some jerk wearing a hat inside .
have some respect .
and pull up your pants !
only crack i want to see is in the liberty bell .
greatest country on the damn planet .
if , six months ago ,
you &apos;d have told me i &apos;d have a big internet show ,
i would have said , &quot; yeah , that adds up . &quot;
i used to entertain my staff with jokes and observations .
when i retired ,
i started sharing those gems around the house .
manny went so nuts for it , he set up the whole webcast .
sorry , internet . he &apos;s your problem now .
bottom line , you can keep your hashtags ,
&apos;cause i like hashbrowns .
but , hey ...
that &apos;s just &quot; jay talking . &quot;
and we &apos;re out .
90 minutes just flew by .
hey , guys !
the comments are already rolling in !
&quot; keep it up , jay . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re saying what we &apos;re all thinking . &quot;
&quot; i miss chop suey , too . &quot;
i love it ,
because now everybody gets to see what i live with .
what the hell ? this guy again ?
who ?
some meatball named &quot; ladykiller52 &quot;
been dogging me for days .
look what he wrote .
&quot; hey , grandpa , no one cares what you think . &quot;
are you sure that that &apos;s not from haley ?
here &apos;s another one . the same jerk !
&quot; it &apos;s weird you don &apos;t like goat cheese
when you &apos;ve got a goat face . &quot;
well , that makes no sense .
what kind of goat eats its own cheese ?
here i am , trying to make america laugh and think ,
and this hockey puck &apos;s coming at me with tired insults .
okay , i @-@ it &apos;s called a troll , jay .
but you can &apos;t let him or anything else
keep you from directing all of your opinions
into that computer .
you &apos;re right , manny .
it &apos;s tough being in the public eye .
now i know why sinatra was always punching guys .
hola , claire .
what &apos;s going on ?
you do a lot of yoga , right ?
ah , i used to .
but all those judgy vegans
with their ponytails and their lululemon ,
i &apos;m like , &quot; nama @-@ stay home , &quot; you know what i mean ?
i just started taking it ,
but i think that the instructor is hitting on me .
he is .
how do you know ?
because you &apos;re you in yoga pants .
just go to another class .
but this one is perfect .
it &apos;s at the same time as joe &apos;s gymboree ,
right next door .
ay , why don &apos;t you come with me today
and tell me if i &apos;m just being crazy ?
sure . text me the info .
hey , remind her !
and don &apos;t forget --
today , all @-@ new episode of &quot; jay talking . &quot;
he takes on restaurants
that write their menus on blackboards .
i want to feel a menu in my hands !
hey , girl .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
just wanted to say hi , talk about stuff .
what stuff ?
i don &apos;t know . i just miss you .
we could talk about anything .
how about ... watergate ?
like , what would you say
were the three most significant ways
it changed american politics ?
cite your sources .
i &apos;m not writing your essay .
okay . see you at easter .
i &apos;m back .
how &apos;d your showing with angie @-@ with @-@ a @-@ heart go ?
oh , fine . uneventful .
nondescript .
this shower &apos;s really small .
could you imagine me in here ?
weird thing -- i was with her for two hours ,
i couldn &apos;t pick her out of a crowd .
really ? that is weird .
nothing weird about it .
you just said it was weird .
that &apos;s weird . give me a kiss !
what are you up to , buddy ?
writing a paper on president nixon .
what an idiot .
he had it all and just threw it away
because of some stupid lie .
well , maybe it came out of his mouth
before he knew what he was saying .
okay , but then he just kept lying over and over
and making it worse and worse .
phil , how old is angie ?
oh , uh , gosh ... 70 . why ?
i was thinking about that house on forsyth .
it &apos;s nice but has a lot of stairs .
no . she &apos;s too ... fat for that .
therefore , i shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow .
if only he had told the truth .
he was in too deep !
check out what i got !
no , thanks .
thought we could go to the park tomorrow
and you could finally learn .
what pavement tastes like ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , lily , when you &apos;re ready , it &apos;s here for you .
mitchell , can i , um , speak to you in the bedroom
about the , uh , dust ruffle ?
don &apos;t worry -- the dust ruffle &apos;s leaving .
okay , why are you doing this ?
we need lily to get on this bike .
why are you pushing this so hard ?
she &apos;s clearly afraid .
she &apos;s been afraid of a lot of things lately .
last week , she wouldn &apos;t even open her closet door
because she thought something scary was in there .
could be the denim jumpsuit your mom made her .
this is a pivotal moment .
we can &apos;t raise a child
who won &apos;t ride a bike or get on an airplane
or eat mayonnaise .
it &apos;s a texture thing . how does egg become that ?
we are doing this tomorrow . she is getting on this bike .
what &apos;s the rush ? she &apos;s 8 years old .
most vietnamese kids her age are already riding a bike to work .
so , where &apos;s mahatma handsy ?
i noticed that you have a lot of these yoga puns .
i don &apos;t think we need any more .
namaste .
okay . now i get the one from before .
we haven &apos;t met .
claire .
claire .
beautiful .
like the sunrise in tanjung rhu .
you have a great yoga body . you &apos;ve done this before ?
um , yeah . i mean , it &apos;s been a little while , but yeah .
great posture , strong core .
we &apos;re going to have fun .
maybe i &apos;ve just been stressed lately , but i was wrong .
yoga felt good .
we are lifting our hips towards the ceiling .
very nice , claire .
ra was very supportive .
maybe i just never had the right teacher .
am i doing it right ?
and they validate parking .
another one ?
i &apos;ve had it with this ladykiller son of a bitch .
he &apos;s been lobbing insults all night .
&quot; hey , dumbbell , i can smell your breath through the internet . &quot;
they can &apos;t do that , right ?
jay , take it from a fellow performer --
if you &apos;re going to put yourself out there ,
you need to let the criticism roll off your back .
i must say , i was impressed you didn &apos;t mope for a month
after that brutal review of you in &quot; sound of music . &quot;
what are you talking about ? there was no review .
there was no school paper that week .
eeeeeexactly . there was no paper that week .
oh , yeah .
what did you do ?
i ...
i am not going to stand here
and let you accuse me of stealing all of those papers !
he didn &apos;t say that .
&quot; after seeing manny delgado
mangle the role of captain von trapp ,
all i can say is &quot; doe @-@ a @-@ dear lord , make it stop .
i am 16 going on antidepressants .
i wanted to climb every mountain and jump off . &quot;
what teacher allowed this ?
hey , grandpa .
hi , honey !
oh , i &apos;m so glad you called .
i &apos;ve just been having the worst week .
it &apos;s been so overwhelming and so much --
you know what helps ? a cocktail .
listen , i &apos;ve got a situation .
do you know any computer nerds
that can track someone down on the internet ?
yeah , i think i can find a few .
okay ! how exciting is this , lily ?
in no time at all , you &apos;re gonna be a bike rider .
or a corpse . okay ...
i know you &apos;re afraid , and sometimes it &apos;s helpful
if you say exactly what you &apos;re afraid of out loud .
so ... ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll fall
because i &apos;m not ready and you forced me ,
so for the rest of my life , i &apos;ll hold it against you .
and then other times ,
it &apos;s just best to tamp it down and soldier on .
i said this when you pried her out of the car ,
and i &apos;ll say this again -- she doesn &apos;t want to do this !
she will when she sees how easy it is for me .
see ? easy as pie !
okay , look , lily , if you don &apos;t want to do this --
i don &apos;t want to do this .
okay .
i &apos;m good !
um ... look . all right . i &apos;m gonna talk to daddy .
but just promise me you &apos;ll learn someday , okay ?
and that you &apos;ll get on a plane .
why wouldn &apos;t i get on a plane ? what &apos;s wrong with them ?
nothing . they &apos;re safer than cars .
cars aren &apos;t safe ? ! oh , my god .
okay ! look -- here &apos;s daddy .
here we are , safe and sound !
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
i just think i left the oven on at home after breakfast ,
so we should get going .
thank god .
no , you had cereal for breakfast .
what &apos;s going on ?
i wiped out , and i think i broke my arm .
i &apos;ve never been in so much pain .
keep smiling .
got to get you to an er .
no , don &apos;t ! no , no !
if lily sees me hurt , she &apos;s never gonna get on a bike .
you crashed because of that shirtless jogger , didn &apos;t you ?
oh , my god . right ?
oh , gloria ! i was wondering if you were gonna be here today .
what are you doing here ?
i got to say , i thought i was over yoga ,
but yesterday was a real eye @-@ opener .
&quot; eye &quot; or &quot; thigh &quot; ?
i thought it was a very challenging class ,
and i don &apos;t really appreciate anything else you &apos;re implying ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re a little ...
i &apos;m what ?
jealous .
of what ? of him rubbing you
like he was expecting a genie to come out ?
look , you are so used to being the center of men &apos;s attention
that yesterday , it probably bothered you that i ... got some .
attention . that &apos;s all . just attention .
that &apos;s insane . i am a married woman .
i am used to getting no attention .
no , angie , you &apos;re like right around the corner from me .
yeah , turn left , walk west ,
and i &apos;ll see you in front of the hair salon .
all right . see you in a minute .
phil ?
no !
what are you guys up to ?
i have a yoga class .
and , apparently , claire does , too .
what are you doing here ?
oh , just on my way to show more houses
to my fat , irish client , angie o &apos;plasty .
i &apos;m going in .
i will tell ra that you &apos;re here .
ra is our yoga instructor .
oh , she must be great . you &apos;re here two days in a row .
she is great .
she &apos;s a little old .
don &apos;t know why i said that .
i got to go .
see you black home .
pretty sure i know why i said that .
this is the most pain i &apos;ve ever been in in my life .
and a horse once kicked me into an electric fence .
well , c @-@ cam , yeah , you broke your arm .
you got to go to the hospital .
no . not yet .
i &apos;ll go in , draw myself a bath ,
pretend to fall and break my arm .
in the meantime , go get those painkillers
that they gave you when you twisted your ankle .
oh , i think i threw those away .
did you ?
or are they in the nightstand next to your bed
because they go good with a glass of wine ?
dad ?
yeah ?
can you open these ?
&apos;course i can .
well ? will you ?
uh ... sure . yeah . now ?
let &apos;s see here .
ooh , you know what ?
there &apos;s a fun way to open these
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve ever taught you .
there ! whoopsie @-@ daisy !
bon appetit . bath time !
okay , so , i got the --
what happened here ?
daddy opened the chips .
with what -- a snowblower ?
oh , i wonder what that noise was .
i hope daddy &apos;s okay !
daddy !
oh , no !
looks like you fell and broke your , uh , left arm .
no , mitchell , i fell . i really fell .
oh , really ?
really .
are you okay ?
my head hurts . and my arm .
i &apos;m never taking a bath again !
oh , great .
too bad you didn &apos;t fall off a stripper pole .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
that is the left . left .
well , this is the address alex &apos;s nerds gave me ,
but it &apos;s not where i pictured a troll living .
&quot; after his performance in &apos; the sound of music , &apos; &quot;
&quot; christopher plummer went on to a distinguished acting career . &quot;
after delgado &apos;s performance , i expect he &apos;ll go on
&quot; to a distinguished plumbing career . &quot;
focus ! i need you to film this for my show tomorrow .
by the way , if the punk &apos;s under 18 , you have to hit him .
what ? ! i never agreed to that !
pritchett ?
earl ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to punch ladykiller in his fat face .
i &apos;m sorry . can we start over ? i was on &quot; photo . &quot;
go ahead . any time .
you &apos;re pathetic .
i crushed you in the closet game ,
and i &apos;m crushing it on the internet .
put that rat down , and i &apos;ll crush you on your porch .
like that is gonna be any more painful than your stupid rant ,
&quot; when did restaurants get so loud ? &quot;
i should have known it was you --
all those typos from your stubby fingers .
watch it . i got my mother &apos;s hands .
you also have your mother &apos;s mustache .
hold this !
hold this .
that went on for a good 20 seconds .
why do we keep doing this ? !
who knows ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you two need each other . it &apos;s what drives you .
the kid is right .
beating you is half the reason i get out of bed .
locking horns .
we made each other better
than i ever thought we could be .
pushed each other to greatness .
we touched the sky .
we &apos;re talking about closets here , right ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry -- you mean the sanctuary
where a man dons his armor in the morning
and takes stock of the battle at night ? !
the one thing we all have in common --
presidents to postmen , tycoons to teachers ,
from sea to shining sea !
this is taking a weird turn .
we did kind of bring out the best in each other ,
didn &apos;t we ?
why did you have to retire , pritchett ?
i miss the fire .
i guess i miss it , too .
all right , here &apos;s something .
what if we do the show together ?
what ? no !
i &apos;m not gonna let you glom onto my new hit show !
43 views .
we could do like a -- like a point / counterpoint kind of thing .
like i would say something like , uh ...
&quot; let &apos;s get rid of pennies , &quot; and you would say ...
of course we should get rid of pennies !
they &apos;re annoying to own
and make you feel bad when you throw them out .
all right , what -- what if i said &quot; i miss milkmen &quot; ?
who doesn &apos;t miss milkmen ?
the glass bottle , little bow tie .
what am i , an idiot ? i don &apos;t miss milkmen ?
okay , well , then you think of something !
i &apos;m not the one auditioning .
okay .
here &apos;s something that represents my unique brand of thinking .
when i fly , i like luggage fees .
me too .
why should us carry @-@ on folk have to foot the bill
for those morons who don &apos;t know how to pack ? !
three weeks , i went from edinburgh to warsaw
on two pairs of pants and a tam @-@ o &apos; -shanter .
i &apos;m falling asleep .
i love naps !
who doesn &apos;t ?
this is ridiculous !
the irony that , despite you two being mortal enemies ,
it appears you agree on everything ?
no !
it &apos;s that this jackass thinks
he can actually bring something new to &quot; jay talking . &quot;
come on ! we would be magic !
you already stole one company from me .
you &apos;re not getting this .
okay , fine !
i will start my own show .
i &apos;ll call it ... &quot; earls of wisdom . &quot;
can &apos;t wait .
i &apos;ll see you in the comments section .
i &apos;ll just turn the comments off .
you can do that ?
yeah .
then why am i here ? !
really , you don &apos;t have to do this .
if i don &apos;t drive you to get your keys ,
how are you gonna get your car ?
well , thank you .
this is me right here .
not here . not here . two down .
oh , there &apos;s a stomach cramp .
much better . uh , right here .
with the mailbox that says &quot; porterfields &quot; ?
yep . it is a joke that we play with the mailman . long story .
i will be right back .
hello ?
hey , claire ? it &apos;s ra .
the readout said &quot; ira burnbaum . &quot;
yeah . uh , &quot; ra &quot; is short for &quot; ira . &quot;
anyway , i was wondering if you wanted to get together ,
maybe grab a shower and a movie ?
no . no .
oh , i am ...
ira , i &apos;m a married woman . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i didn &apos;t pick up that energy when i was planking you .
phil ! what are you doing home ?
i lost my car keys . who were you talking to ?
nobody . why are your pants ripped ?
no reason .
here they are . see you later !
there you are .
off we go .
phil , why didn &apos;t you show me this house ?
it has everything i want .
i forgot it was for sale .
you &apos;re the agent .
i remember -- it &apos;s built cheap .
it ... looks pretty solid to me .
well , it &apos;s mostly held up by beehives .
let &apos;s go .
phil , what is going on ?
nothing . just trying to keep you away from all that asbestos .
do you not want me as a neighbor ?
okay .
i @-@ i can &apos;t do this anymore . no more lies .
it is related to that .
i did not peg you for a racist .
wait . no , no , no , no , no !
wait , wait , wait . angie ...
it &apos;s always the last people you think .
we &apos;re done . goodbye , phil .
no , angie ! that &apos;s not it !
i lied to my wife
because she knows i have a thing for black women !
oh , really ?
hey , there !
so , that was angie o &apos;hara ?
okay .
full disclosure ...
i did lie .
but only because she &apos;s beautiful and you get a little crazy .
why the hell did i say that ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re being so understanding . it &apos;s so unlike you .
are you secretly mad ?
are you lulling me into a false sense of security ?
are you gonna do something to me while i &apos;m asleep ?
phil , you know what really gets my goat ?
that you lied .
guess men are men .
i don &apos;t know why i expected anything more .
hello ?
i want to apologize . you were right .
it did bother me that ra gave you all the attention .
he &apos;s an attractive man , and you &apos;re a very sexy woman .
of course he put his hands all over you .
what ?
ra ?
it &apos;s phil .
b @-@ bye @-@ bye !
claire ...
you know what really gets my goat ?
okay , lily . let &apos;s do this .
can we just please give this a rest
until you &apos;re fully recovered ?
no . mitchell , we &apos;re in too deep .
i have a broken arm , and i can &apos;t remember
any of my grade @-@ school teachers &apos; names .
yeah , you &apos;ve mentioned that four times now .
have i really ?
yeah .
all right . uh , lily , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s get on the bike .
carefully . carefully .
one leg at a time over .
feet on the pedals . perfect .
and then we start pedaling .
mitchell , we start pedaling .
good . now let go .
don &apos;t let go !
okay .
mitchell , let go .
i &apos;m not ready .
she &apos;s not ready !
mitchell , sidebar , please .
okay . okay . stopping .
just put your feet down . be right back .
what &apos;s wrong , lily ? don &apos;t you know how to ride a bike ?
yeah , sydney . i &apos;m just showing him how to teach a kid .
okay , i &apos;m dragging my feet because i have a brain injury .
why are you dragging yours , again ?
because i don &apos;t want her to get hurt !
no , see , it &apos;s not the worst thing in the world
that she &apos;s actually starting to be cautious .
she used to fly off of bookcases and jump off of swing sets ,
and now she &apos;s trying to protect herself .
and what kind of life is she gonna have
if she &apos;s scared of everything ?
a life where i don &apos;t have to worry about her .
i get it .
so you &apos;re the one that &apos;s afraid .
it &apos;s dangerous out there .
t @-@ there &apos;s so much weird stuff going on in the world ,
and i just ... i want her to be safe .
i guess we can wait a couple weeks if she wants to .
lily , it &apos;s ...
lily ?
lily ?
cam , look !
oh , my gosh ! that &apos;s so great !
god , i hope so .
ohh , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
yeah .
miss tweeddale -- fourth grade .
mr. kleezak ! mr. lundgren !
i &apos;m back !
oh , my god . i told ...
angie , thank you so much for meeting me .
this is my wife , claire .
you need to know that my husband
is the furthest thing from a racist .
i love black women .
maybe a little too much .
so , i told her that you were white ,
which is the only reason
i didn &apos;t want you living across the street .
i didn &apos;t want her to find out that i was lying .
is that true ?
sadly , yes .
well , i am relieved .
although it is a little offensive to be reduced to a type .
of course . i &apos;m sorry .
hey , babe . everything okay ?
uh , yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just a big misunderstanding .
uh , this is phil .
and his wife , claire .
hello .
yeah . apology accepted .
i &apos;m on fire .
