good morning , tiger .
i &apos;m making you a big breakfast , so you can keep up your strength for tonight .
you &apos;re gonna get me good and pregnant .
i &apos;ve got nowhere to go this morning . i &apos;m unemployed .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .
well , i just lost my erection .
no , i mean , what am i supposed to do with myself ?
you &apos;re supposed to find your passion in life .
you can be whatever you want to be now . it &apos;s exciting .
yeah , but it &apos;s all so overwhelming . i don &apos;t know where to start .
wait a second . i can help you with this .
you just need to be organized . we can make a list of your qualifications ..
and categorize jobs by industry . there could be folders and files ..
hey , this is where your hyper @-@ organized pain @-@ in @-@ the @-@ ass stuff pays off .
i know !
my erection is back !
the.one.where.rachel.goes.back.to.work
thank you .
joey , could i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?
okay .
thank you .
thank you .
phoebe , have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , i &apos;m a little short on cash .
if you want , i could loan you some money .
oh , no . i learned never to borrow money from friends .
that &apos;s why richard dreyfuss and i don &apos;t speak anymore .
why don &apos;t you just spunge off your boyfriend ?
yeah , right , the unemployed piano player who gave his trust fund to charity ?
i &apos;m splitting the muffin with him .
hey , how about this ? wanna be an extra on my show ?
you could do that ?
the pay &apos;s pretty good , and you could do it for as long as you need .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna be on tv !
okay , now ..
i gotta tell you , being on tv isn &apos;t as glamorous and exciting as you think .
really ?
no , it is awesome .
hey , guys .
why are you all dressed up ?
we &apos;re bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone .
doesn &apos;t she look cute ?
she sure does .
why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?
because if one more person says , &quot; what a cute little boy .. &quot;
i &apos;m gonna whip them with a car antenna .
i think she &apos;s gonna be the hit of the office .
yeah , she &apos;s gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a @-@ line skirts .
can i get a blue bow ?
okay . i have looked through a bunch of career guides ..
photocopied and highlighted key passages ..
and put them into alphabetical folders , so you can make an informed decision .
how long was i in there ?
okay , let &apos;s start with the a &apos;s . advertising .
wait . advertising , that &apos;s a great idea .
don &apos;t you wanna look through the rest ?
i don &apos;t think i have to hear the rest . advertising makes perfect sense .
sorry you had to waste all this time .
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ?
now i &apos;ll get to use my shredder !
i mean , i could write slogans . how hard could it be , right ?
&quot; cheese . it &apos;s milk that you chew . &quot;
&quot; crackers . because your cheese needs a buddy . &quot;
&quot; a grape . because who can get a watermelon in your mouth ? &quot;
i got one .
&quot; socks . because your family &apos;s feet deserve the best . &quot;
honey , leave it to the pros .
i actually know someone in advertising .
i grew up with a guy who is a vice president at a big agency .
maybe i can get him to meet you . give me the phone .
&quot; the phone . bringing you closer to people who have phones . &quot;
&quot; marriage . it &apos;s not for everybody . &quot;
that went well . almost everybody knew that she was a girl .
yeah , after you punched that one guy who got it wrong , word spread .
i &apos;m just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .
who the hell are you ?
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the hell person whose office this is .
good one , rach .
i &apos;m gavin mitchell , the person who &apos;s taking over your job .
excuse me ?
your baby &apos;s so cute .
but why would you put a pink bow on a boy ?
hey , joey . look at me .
i &apos;m a nurse .
yes , you are .
i think it might be time for my sponge bath .
sorry , i &apos;m just so used to hitting on the extras .
so are you excited about your scene ?
yeah , but i &apos;m a little nervous .
relax . don &apos;t be . they &apos;ll probably just make you stand in the background .
good .
you . here , come here . here .
take this tray , stand on this yellow mark . you &apos;re gonna move on &quot; action . &quot;
walk over to the operating table , stop on the blue mark and put the tray down .
don &apos;t walk too fast .
but don &apos;t dawdle .
okay . now , what ?
and , action !
cut ! cut .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just a little nervous .
well , don &apos;t be .
okay , that helps .
and , action !
cut !
don &apos;t worry about it , phoebe . it usually takes me three takes too .
all right , eight .
and , action !
so do you have any other questions about advertising ?
no . but let me show you what i can do .
&quot; bagels and doughnuts .
round food for every mood . &quot;
monica warned me you might do that .
i think we might have something for you at the agency .
really ? that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s an unpaid internship .
that &apos;s funny . when you said &quot; unpaid , &quot; it sounded like you said &quot; unpaid . &quot;
it won &apos;t be forever . it just takes a year or two to get good portfolio together .
well , i can skip a couple of steps , right ? i mean , you did hear my round food thing .
you &apos;re changing careers . no matter what you do , you &apos;ll have to start at the bottom .
it &apos;s gonna be years before you &apos;re making anything near as much as you were before .
so you &apos;re paying the check , right ?
come on , now . monica has a good job . it &apos;s not like you have a family to support .
actually , we &apos;re trying . i don &apos;t think monica is gonna want to postpone it .
we &apos;re supposed to have sex tonight .
actually , she &apos;s probably at home , naked right now .
i tend to keep talking till somebody stops me .
i can just picture her on the bed .
stop !
wait . what do you mean you &apos;re taking over my job ?
while you were on your baby vacation , i was doing your job .
a vacation ? my idea of a vacation does not involve ..
something sucking on my nipples until they are raw .
clearly , you &apos;ve never been to sandals paradise lsland .
all right . don &apos;t get too comfortable there , because i &apos;m back in two weeks .
i want everything back the way it was .
i can &apos;t say i care too much for the way you &apos;ve rearranged my office .
i can &apos;t say i care too much for that smell you &apos;ve brought in .
excuse me ?
rach , we have a code brown situation .
honey , could you please take care of it for me ?
all right , but you &apos;re gonna have to do one sometime .
let me just get this straight .
so i go have a baby , and they send some guy in to do my job ?
well , there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren altogether .
okay . right . you &apos;re very cheeky for a temp .
i &apos;m not a temp . i was transferred here from another department .
and what department was that ? the jerk department ?
they didn &apos;t tell me about your quick wit .
well , did they mention that i &apos;m rubber and you &apos;re glue ?
gavin , ralph loved your ideas .
hi , mr. zelner .
rachel . i see you &apos;ve met gavin .
when you left us , we weren &apos;t sure what we were gonna do .
but then , gavin to the rescue . super gavin .
well , that &apos;s great .
so now , super gavin , when i come back ..
where do you plan on flying off to ?
that &apos;s up to mr. zelner . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll make the right decision .
super ass @-@ kissing power .
incidentally , when are you coming back ?
today .
you said two weeks .
no , i said today .
see , for a superhero , not so much with the listening .
i &apos;m sorry . rachel , we should probably go .
i ran out of diapers , and i had to use your sweater .
i didn &apos;t bring a sweater .
then , we should really go .
so , what &apos;d he say ?
he can be a little rough around the edges ..
so i &apos;m gonna replace a word he used a lot with the word &quot; puppy . &quot;
so he said , &quot; if your puppy friend doesn &apos;t get her puppy act together ..
i am gonna fire her mother @-@ puppy ass . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this . i &apos;m just not an actor .
that &apos;s right . you &apos;re not . you &apos;re a nurse .
you &apos;re nurse with tray .
no , joey ..
nurse with tray doesn &apos;t know joey . she has no time for friends .
she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor ..
because if she doesn &apos;t , people die .
who dies ?
man with eye patch !
now , you get in there , and you do your job .
yes , doctor .
okay , let &apos;s try this one more time .
hang in there , man with eye patch . your tray is coming .
and , action .
yes , i did it ! i nailed it !
what &apos;s next ?
the rest of the scene .
okay , from the top , people .
hey , you know what i was thinking ? i don &apos;t know if &quot; code brown &quot; is the best code word .
i think people might know what we &apos;re talking about .
that &apos;s fine . listen , sudden change of plans . my maternity leave just ended .
they said if i didn &apos;t come back today , they &apos;d fire me .
what ? no , that &apos;s illegal .
i &apos;ll have the labor department here so fast , they won &apos;t ..
all right , calm down , norma rae . they didn &apos;t actually say that .
i &apos;m just afraid if i don &apos;t come back now , this guy will try and squeeze me out .
but what about emma ? i mean , we don &apos;t have a nanny .
i know . we &apos;re just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight .
can you please just take care of her for today ?
absolutely . just give me your breasts , and we &apos;ll be on our way .
come on . i don &apos;t know what else to do .
fine . fine .
we &apos;ll have fun , won &apos;t we ? yes , we will . yes , we ..
ross .
you &apos;re pretty .
whatever i decide to do , i &apos;m gonna be starting a new career from scratch .
it &apos;s gonna be a while before i make a living at it .
maybe now &apos;s not the right time to be starting a family .
so you have to tell monica you don &apos;t want to have a baby right now ?
yeah .
goodbye .
okay , it &apos;s baby time . pants off , bing .
didn &apos;t see you there , geller .
ross is here , so ..
and i was really hoping that maybe i could hang out .
you know , what do you feel like doing ?
well , we &apos;re gonna have sex .
i don &apos;t feel like having sex .
maybe .. i don &apos;t know . maybe we can watch a movie or something .
let me put it this way :
we &apos;re having sex whether you &apos;re here or not .
pants off , bing .
now that i &apos;m back , why don &apos;t you just fill me in on what you &apos;ve been up to .
well , i &apos;ve changed your screen saver from that picture of * nsync .
hey , they were popular when i left .
i &apos;m working on this big presentation for tomorrow .
i should be involved in that , so get me up to speed .
that &apos;ll take weeks . let me take care of the presentation .
no . i see what you &apos;re doing here , all right ?
this is my job , buddy . i &apos;ve had it for five years , and i know how it works .
so why don &apos;t you just catch me up .
fine .
oh , god . you &apos;ve totally messed with the back support on my chair .
how do you fix this ?
you &apos;ve been here five years .
you figure it out .
fine , i will .
all right , fill me in .
do you have a blue tie that would go with this ? emma spit up on mine .
yeah , but you have to give it back if i get a job .
of course , by that time , ties will be obsolete ..
and we &apos;ll all be wearing silver jumpsuits .
hey , good morning , lover .
i gotta say , after last night , i &apos;m a little weak in the knees .
here &apos;s an idea . you walk into a room , take a quick scan .
sorry .
but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .
oh , god , i have to tell you something .
you &apos;re not pregnant .
what are you talking about ?
well , that thing that i have to do to make a baby ?
i faked it .
what ? you faked it ?
you know what ?
i don &apos;t need a tie .
i mean , it &apos;s better open collar , you know ?
it &apos;s more casual .
joey . listen , i can &apos;t do this . it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
yesterday i was a nurse , and today i &apos;m a waitress at a cafe ?
sometimes we use the same extras for different parts . it &apos;s okay .
well , it &apos;s not okay , because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse .
and now , suddenly , i &apos;m the waitress ? that &apos;s gonna confuse my fans .
well , maybe you are a nurse ..
but you moonlight as a waitress .
because i &apos;m a single mother supporting my two children .
nice .
wait a minute .
dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital . wouldn &apos;t i come say hi ?
no . no , see , you and drake are having a fight .
about what ?
he slept with you .. best sex you ever had , by the way .
and then never called you .
and i just wanted a new daddy for davey and becky .
okay . okay , from the top .
and , action .
so i &apos;m surprised you agreed to have lunch with me .
i &apos;m surprised too . but yet , here i am .
cut ! cut !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back .
me too .
me too !
calm down . she means on the show .
we need some new extras around here .
wow . you &apos;re here already .
yes . emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation .
actually , i made a few changes . i think i &apos;m caught up on everything .
so ask me anything .
how do you fix the chair ?
except that !
hello , mr. zelner . we are all ready for our presentation this afternoon .
good , because it &apos;s in 10 minutes .
what ? i can &apos;t do that . i have the baby .
ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour .
then gavin can give the presentation . we have to do it now .
ralph needs to leave early today . he &apos;s going helicopter shopping .
but i love that man . i &apos;d follow him into hell .
microphones .
well , there you go , you win . you win .
you get to do the presentation . you &apos;ll knock them dead .
no one will remember that i worked here , and then ralph will buy his helicopter ..
and super gavin will just fly right alongside of him .
you can do the presentation .
no , i can &apos;t . i have a baby .
i &apos;ll watch her .
why would you do that ?
because you worked really hard , and it &apos;s your job . and you &apos;re a little crazy .
that &apos;s really nice .
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .
well , you &apos;re not gonna like what &apos;s coming .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
god .
thank you . thank you .
i &apos;m really fine . don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m great with children .
gavin mitchell . pleased to meet you .
please don &apos;t fire my friend . just let me talk to her .
okay , but this is her last chance .
thank you .
how about i do something for you ?
tomorrow , i &apos;ll bring you a hat , cover up the bald .
listen , phoebe . i was just talking to the director ..
and he was thinking maybe this time you don &apos;t hit drake .
you just wait on the tables .
i can &apos;t do that . i &apos;m an actor . i have a process .
you &apos;re a masseuse . you have a table with a hole in it .
wait , i see what &apos;s happening here . you &apos;re threatened .
what ?
i &apos;m so good in the scene that i &apos;m stealing focus from you .
rise to the challenge , tribbiani , because i just raised the bar .
come join me up here .
okay , great . i will .
okay , good .
yeah , you can fire her , but i would call security . she won &apos;t go easy .
you faked it ? you couldn &apos;t have faked it .
yes , you can . you just make the faces and the noises .
guys can fake it ?
unbelievable . the one thing that &apos;s ours .
why would you fake it when we &apos;re trying to have a baby ?
well , that &apos;s actually why .
look , i &apos;m starting a whole new career now .
i &apos;m not saying i don &apos;t want a baby .
i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .
like a month ?
or a year ?
really ? you wanna wait a year ?
it could be less than a year . i mean , you &apos;ve heard my stuff .
&quot; pants . like shorts but longer . &quot;
it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .
i really wanna have a baby .
well , yeah , me too .
look , i &apos;ll just get my old job back .
no , i want you to have a job that you love ..
not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .
i quit , and you learn what i do ?
i think there &apos;s never gonna be a right time to have a baby .
now you &apos;re unemployed , and in a little while ..
you &apos;ll find a new job that &apos;ll keep you really busy .
there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to do this ..
but i think once the baby comes , we &apos;ll forget about all those reasons .
i guess .
i mean , it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .
it &apos;s gonna be really scary .
i mean , god , when we have a baby ..
there &apos;s gonna be so much that we &apos;re not able to control .
i mean , the apartment &apos;s gonna be a mess .
i won &apos;t have time to clean it .
what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ..
and messes up all the ribbons ?
what if there &apos;s no room for a ribbon drawer ..
because the baby &apos;s stuff takes up all the space ?
where will all the ribbons go ?
should we go make a baby before you change your mind ?
yes , please !
okay .
and i promise i will not fake it this time .
well , i wish i could say the same . i &apos;m a little shook up .
i know you botched that operation on purpose .
i can &apos;t prove it yet , but when i do , you &apos;ll be going to jail for murder .
i don &apos;t care if you are my brother .
i &apos;m not your brother .
what about my children , drake ?
no ! no ! no !
