follow me , end up like me .
do you know who &apos;s doing this ?
no .
but i also know that &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t playing around .
we have three hours to find out
who &quot; a &quot; is before &quot; a &quot; finds us .
this is &quot; a &apos;s &quot; lair .
&quot; a &quot; is dressed like the black swan .
i don &apos;t want aria with him any more than you do ,
but if you back him into a corner ,
nobody will end up happy .
you &apos;re connected to jenna
and ian and jason--
almost like you guys were members of the same club .
you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
the murder of alison dilaurentis .
it &apos;s about revenge .
you deserved everything you got !
mona &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
mona !
they think it &apos;s over .
loser mona &apos;s going to the nuthouse ,
and those precious liars are going home to sleep
with their windows open and their doors unlocked .
don &apos;t they know that &apos;s what we want ?
they found a body .
they think it &apos;s maya .
em , you and i are the only ones who did anything
worth talking about this summer .
aria took some boring picture class
and spencer went to college .
i took a full load at hollis ,
and aria beat out a thousands applicants
for a space in that photography class .
so , how many houses did you build ?
uh , i think we finished about six .
and in poor countries ,
one house is like a home for fifty .
okay , miss productive .
how much of your list did you actually do ?
let &apos;s see ...
cooking class with caleb . done .
volunteer at the animal shelter for pocket dogs--
wait . that exists ?
did not do .
expand my vocabulary . effectuating .
interned for vera wang .
you got an internship for vera wang ?
yeah , i changed my mind .
turns out they want you to work for free .
was that a car ?
no , it &apos;s just the wind .
oh , careful , em , they &apos;re already pretty strong .
maybe for you , you &apos;re a pixie .
i &apos;ve gotten really good at this .
&quot; show me your boobs . &apos; a &apos; . &quot;
does mona have a ten @-@ year @-@ old brother ?
&quot; a &quot; for &quot; annoying . &quot;
are these ever gonna stop ?
eventually we &apos;ll be old news .
yeah , and then garrett will go on trial
and we &apos;ll be news again .
or mona will start talking
and we &apos;ll be news again .
or i &apos;ll show someone my boobs
and we &apos;ll be news again .
okay !
hey , i thought this was a party .
you know what ? you &apos;re right , em . welcome back .
and you &apos;re never allowed to leave for an entire summer again .
to making it to senior year .
hear !
not all of us made it .
i &apos;m sorry , em . i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
to maya .
em , you know that we &apos;re here for you .
to maya .
to maya .
to maya .
hanna .
where &apos;s emily and spencer ?
i don &apos;t know .
i need an aspirin and a trough of water .
emily ?
she &apos;s gone .
what do you mean she &apos;s gone ?
i &apos;ve looked everywhere .
how could she not remember anything ?
she &apos;s totally out of it .
she &apos;s still drunk .
you don &apos;t think that she had anything to do with this , do you ?
no !
she-- she can hardly stand .
how did she get here ?
hann , hand me em &apos;s phone .
em , you got a blocked call at eleven .
who was it ? do you remember who you talked to ?
um ... i think i remember leaving your house ,
and the next thing i know you guys are calling me
and i &apos;m here .
what ? that can &apos;t be right .
what is it ?
it says that at midnight she got a call from my phone .
you were asleep , right ?
oh , my god . somebody called emily from my phone .
somebody was in my house .
you guys , this is a set @-@ up .
what was that ?
we need to get out of here . now .
come on .
if i never see another shovel again , it &apos;ll be too soon .
wait . do we wipe it off or something ?
do we wipe off the prints ?
who would do this to emily ?
who would do it to ali ?
some twisted psycho .
the only twisted psycho we know is locked up at radley .
let &apos;s get out of here .
everything ?
everything .
the only person who benefits from the missing body is ali &apos;s killer .
he killed maya , too .
i know , em .
and garrett &apos;s gonna rot in hell for it .
jenna wouldn &apos;t help garrett .
she put him in jail .
what about your sister ?
she &apos;s in philadelphia , and as far as we know ,
the only thing she &apos;s guilty of
is being in ali &apos;s room the night that she died .
there has to be someone else ...
someone we don &apos;t know who &apos;s connected to garrett .
duck .
really ?
get down !
it &apos;s lucas . what is he doing out so late ?
hanna , he can &apos;t hear us .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re leaving .
we &apos;re going to the lake house .
when my mom reads this note ,
she &apos;ll think that we &apos;ve been up there since this afternoon .
em ?
hello ?
i &apos;m sorry if i woke you up .
i don &apos;t know how to tell you this ...
were there ... any witnesses ?
no , mom , i-- i understand .
okay , bye .
the caretaker called it in this morning .
the place is crawling with reporters ,
but the police don &apos;t have any leads .
so we &apos;re okay . nobody saw us .
yeah .
i &apos;m so sorry , guys .
this is all my fault .
no one &apos;s blaming you .
yeah , em . somebody took you there
to make it look like you dug up ali &apos;s body .
and i made it so easy .
if i wasn &apos;t so wasted--
em .
last night never happened .
are we sure about that ?
we can still go to the cops . we can tell them the truth .
we don &apos;t even know what the truth is .
okay .
we got up here yesterday afternoon .
we roasted some marshmallows ,
we talked about how much fun senior year is gonna be , and ...
we went to bed early .
em ?
i understand .
last night never happened .
are you okay ?
i thought the nightmares stopped .
i guess they started again .
hey ... you &apos;re still safe , aria .
there &apos;s no more &quot; a. &quot;
you were far away from this mess last night .
thank god you stayed at spencer &apos;s lake house .
did you read this ?
apparently maya found some things that belonged to alison .
no , no . she-- she gave everything to jason .
well , actually , they think she may have kept something ,
something that connected garrett to alison &apos;s murder .
that doesn &apos;t make sense . she would have told emily .
well , maybe that &apos;s what she was on her way to do ,
but garrett found her first .
do you know what this weekend is ?
how could i forget ?
labor day is the anniversary of alison &apos;s death .
or ...
i was about to start a teaching job ,
and you thought you might like to teach ...
was that true , or were you just hitting on me ?
did you really play b26 , or were you just hitting on me ?
can we make this ... our anniversary
instead of hers ?
meet me tomorrow night at the rosewood grille .
i will be the guy at the bar reading ulysses .
you still haven &apos;t finished that book ?
no one has .
i &apos;m just a hopeless romantic .
i thought we could recreate the date .
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it date .
we ended the night in the bathroom .
i remember .
i think it went something like ... this ?
and then i did something like this ...
hanna ? you like this ?
yeah , i love it ... for a pregnant woman .
is there something i need to know ?
i &apos;d need to have sex to get pregnant .
ew ! mom , that &apos;s gross .
well , since when did you become a prude ?
since you intimated that you want to have sex .
hanna-- all right , you &apos;re allowed to date ,
but you &apos;re not ... open for business .
hanna .
are you starting a business , ashley ?
go . shop .
i was hoping a little retail therapy
might take hanna &apos;s mind off the headlines .
yeah , one murder makes the news ,
but two dead girls and a missing body ?
how big is your closet ?
he did it , right ?
garrett hired someone to dig up that grave ?
this hasn &apos;t made the papers ,
but the prosecution had petitioned to have the body exhumed ,
but it was gone before the judge could make his ruling .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a coincidence .
can i just tell you ,
i am so relieved that the girls were out of town last night .
for once they were reading the news instead of making it .
it was just toby . i &apos;ll call him back .
does he like the loft ?
well , he comes over to shower every day
because the plumbing is broken ,
so i really like the loft .
we are always going to be those girls who knew alison .
and now maya .
hey ! you know what ? i could take a picture and send it to you .
look , i keep on replaying last night in my head .
hanna , there was somebody in my house .
while we were sound asleep , they were right there ,
they were in the same room as us .
just as i was starting to feel safe again .
i just-- i really want to turn my brain off .
can we ditch our moms and go catch a movie ?
ohh , i can &apos;t .
i have an appointment with dr. sullivan .
oh . you &apos;re seeing her again ?
yeah . a little .
but you ... wouldn &apos;t tell her about--
no !
come on , i wouldn &apos;t do that to emily .
yeah , but it &apos;s not just emily . we were all there .
hanna , we should get going .
okay .
you know what , i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
almost forgot .
you &apos;ll need to wear it while you &apos;re on this floor .
we still haven &apos;t seen any changes ,
but i &apos;m sure she appreciates your visits .
your friend is here .
can you say hello ?
that was a reporter at the door .
whoever took ali &apos;s body gave him reason to start knocking again .
what did you say to him ?
before i slammed the door in his face , or after ?
you know , you made a difference this summer , em .
and i think maya would have been proud .
i know i am .
it was a lot easier to pound nails in haiti
than it would have been to stay here .
you know , when grandma died ,
i thought i would carry that grief with me forever .
but time really does help ...
and eventually it stops hurting so much .
i &apos;m okay , mom .
really .
birds , birds , birds .
you cannot find a top this season without feathers on it .
are you gonna look right through me forever ?
look , it &apos;s not easy for me to get here , okay ?
i have been lying to everyone i care about for weeks ,
and after what happened last night , i--
i need you to understand something .
i am not doing this for you .
i &apos;m here for me .
i want to know what i did to make you hate me so much .
hanna ?
um , no .
no , you must have me confused with someone else .
oh , miss rivers , i &apos;m sorry .
your resemblance to an old friend is uncanny .
please don &apos;t tell anybody that you saw me here .
what are doing here ? what are you doing here ?
i volunteer a few days a month . quid pro quo .
what ?
it &apos;s your turn .
look , she owes me some answers .
i need it to make sense .
sense is something rarely mined from mental illness .
trust me , i &apos;ve spent a lifetime trying .
i &apos;m starting to figure that out .
i mean , i don &apos;t think i can keep coming back .
it &apos;s like she doesn &apos;t even know that i &apos;m here .
come here .
i promise i &apos;ll get plumbing fixed in the loft by the end of the week .
oh , no . it &apos;s no rush at all .
really . there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s no rush .
are your parents still out ?
yes ...
you know that &apos;s my shirt .
and you &apos;re never getting it back .
i don &apos;t want it back .
you look better in it than i do .
okay , i know that it was my idea to wait ...
but right now i &apos;m just completely forgetting why .
you &apos;ll remember after i put some clothes on .
i am so happy you guys
decided to go to the lake house yesterday .
yeah , me too .
i can &apos;t imagine what went
through your head when your mom called you .
can we not talk about it ?
just the thought of somebody doing that to alison is really--
of course .
i &apos;ll call you later .
yes , please .
so let &apos;s meet up after and go to the store together .
i can &apos;t . i have an appointment with dr. sullivan .
can you do it ?
i though the point of cooking together
was being together .
it is and i promise , when i get back
we will make an unforgettable dong po .
say it again .
no !
please !
no .
do you want me to go to the store ?
dong po .
gimme the list .
even if i say his name
we get sucked into this vortex of awkwardness .
and my dad pretends like he can &apos;t hear ,
but his neck gets all red and
then his face pinches up like he &apos;s constipated .
so basically ezra is like lord voldemort .
hi , lucas .
he knows something .
i thought you said he didn &apos;t see you guys .
he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s no coincidence that he turned dark
after the masquerade ball .
jenna has that effect on people .
yeah , but she &apos;s been gone all summer ,
and he &apos;s still boo radley .
have you ever noticed how many skinny brunettes
go to this school ?
she fits the costume .
has anybody heard from emily ?
no . i left her a bunch of messages .
yeah , me too .
hope she &apos;s okay .
hello ?
help !
somebody help me !
aria , are you ok ?
i had a panic attack .
you guys , i think i saw &quot; a. &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t , okay ?
mona is in a straitjacket at radley .
yeah , i heard that she &apos;s practically in a coma over there .
that girl interruptthing
could just be an act to keep her out of jail .
you know what she &apos;s capable of , we all do .
yeah , but she can &apos;t hurt us anymore , okay ?
bitch crazy .
don &apos;t worry , aria .
someday we will all have jubilation .
that was a really good use of that word , han .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come ?
yeah , i just have one last test to study for .
oh , it &apos;s a long weekend , honey .
you can put in hours tomorrow .
i know--
i really could use the extra day .
come on , a girl &apos;s night out in the city might be fun .
like old times .
before your sister ...
mom , melissa is a hastings .
we bounce back like superballs .
don &apos;t work too hard .
okay .
bye .
have fun .
aw , you gave this to me for mother &apos;s day .
this poor girl just can &apos;t get any peace .
mom , i love you , but can we please just not talk about alison ?
i need a break from that .
you know , i wouldn &apos;t take any of it back ,
and neither would your father .
are you sure this is what you want ?
when your father and i met , we were so young .
but as life got more complicated ...
it was just harder for us to find ways to compromise .
you &apos;re talking about me and ezra . we &apos;re the complication .
no . that is just one of the many issues we couldn &apos;t agree on .
yeah , but it &apos;s-- it &apos;s the one that drove you two apart .
that is absolutely not true .
we &apos;re just too different now .
and that &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t want to pretend to be somebody that i &apos;m not ,
and your father shouldn &apos;t have to either .
remember when i was thirteen
and you took me to that grown @-@ up lunch
and you ... you made me a promise
to allow me to be me .
of course .
mom , you &apos;re doing that .
by not shutting out ezra ,
you &apos;re allowing me to be who i want to be .
well , i haven &apos;t exactly welcomed him with open arms .
no . but you don &apos;t cringe when i say his name .
or look constipated like your father does .
you noticed that too ?
yeah .
you look great , em .
you really do .
you look happy .
i am .
i &apos;m sorry if i took you away from spencer .
it &apos;s a holiday weekend , i &apos;m sure you guys had plans .
it &apos;s okay . she &apos;s got one last test , so ...
she &apos;s studying .
yeah .
thanks , angie .
so , when did you move upstairs ?
i started the remodel a few weeks ago .
i mean , it &apos;s still roughing it ,
but i get to live for free while i do the work .
and it feels really good to be out on my own .
how &apos;s jenna ?
i haven &apos;t talked to her since she left town .
are you okay , emily ?
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t think i am .
it &apos;s all over the news .
what kind of a sick person would do something like that ?
there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
how was the shrink ?
it was fine .
what do you guys talk about ?
stuff .
do you talk about us ?
no .
how can you not talk about us ?
we &apos;re intimate .
we &apos;re what ?
yeah , let &apos;s just forget that .
you just said the &quot; i &quot; word .
you should get that .
i have never heard a guy say the &quot; i &quot; word .
here .
well , you &apos;re saved . it &apos;s spencer .
we have to talk about this pool thing for tomorrow .
hello ?
is miss rivers available ?
how &apos;d you get my number ?
i took a chance that miss rivers &apos; emergency contact
harvey marin might , in fact , be hanna marin .
is something wrong with mona ?
other than the obvious ?
is that brit humor ? because it &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m sorry , i have a very dry sense of humor .
can you just cut to the chase ?
mona &apos;s making progress ,
and her doctor thinks that your visits may be helping .
what kind of progress ?
you should come by tomorrow and see for yourself .
hey . everything okay ?
spencer , i don &apos;t want to eat raw veggies
if we &apos;re hanging out in bikinis all day .
but chips and salsa sounds great !
uh , pardon ?
bye , spencer .
good night .
i spent half the summer partying way too much .
i &apos;ve just been so angry .
em , that &apos;s understandable .
i can &apos;t imagine losing someone that way .
i was at this one party and i got so wasted
i don &apos;t even remember being there .
you don &apos;t remember anything ?
i really let my friends down .
you know how spencer and the girls feel about you .
yeah , but they &apos;re like my family .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t stand to disappoint them .
that &apos;s what &apos;s so great about friends--
they &apos;not your family .
they accept you for who you are .
i &apos;m listening .
aria , the police are here .
they want to talk to you .
we went to spencer &apos;s lake house .
we made a fire and emily showed us the picture from her trip .
we spent the evening catching up .
it was a pretty low @-@ key night .
i &apos;ll call you when we get home . okay .
are they charging them ?
no , it &apos;s just routine .
the girls were at your lake house last night .
i don &apos;t understand why they &apos;re being questioned .
they said it was part of the ongoing investigation .
and you believe that ?
uh , excuse me .
have you seen her ? is she okay ?
she hasn &apos;t come out yet .
look , i get why you &apos;re here ,
and i &apos;m sure she &apos;d appreciate it ,
but i think the last thing she needs right now is the police
questioning her relationship with a former teacher .
i thought we were past this .
are you okay ? do i need to talk to them ?
no , i &apos;m fine . i just want to get out of here .
we could still make our reservation .
or maybe we could do this another time ?
i &apos;m sure we could all use a bite , right ?
yes . um , let &apos;s go .
they &apos;ve had you on a lot of medication ,
so i don &apos;t know if you remember ,
but i &apos;ve been visiting you for a couple of weeks now .
remember that cute doctor from rosewood memorial ?
the one who was engaged to spencer &apos;s sister ?
of course you do . you &apos;re &quot; a. &quot;
well , he thinks my visits have been helping you ...
so if you want , i can keep coming back .
is it something you want ?
could have been you behind this glass .
the cops were so close to pinning it on you .
i &apos;m sorry i had to keep calling you like that .
i know what you think of me ...
but i swear to you , i didn &apos;t do it .
all of the evidence they have against me , it &apos;s bogus .
you said that you would tell me the truth .
so what is it ?
there &apos;s a lot you don &apos;t know , spencer .
some of it you don &apos;t want to know .
do you think there &apos;s any chance
i &apos;m gonna get a fair trial in this town ?
everybody already thinks i &apos;m guilty .
i don &apos;t know anything about maya ,
but i may know who killed alison .
i &apos;m listening .
i need a lawyer , and your mom &apos;s one of the best in the state .
no . i &apos;m not going to help you .
you &apos;re not safe , spencer , and your friends aren &apos;t either .
you &apos;re just trying to scare me .
it &apos;s not over ! do you hear me ?
i know who took the body !
i &apos;ll try one more time .
why wasn &apos;t she at the police station ?
do you think she told &apos; em the truth ?
if she told &apos; em the truth , we wouldn &apos;t be standing here .
em , that was me calling you . where have you been ?
it &apos;s okay . if you told them the truth ,
we &apos;ll figure something out .
no , i would never do that to you guys .
they called all three of us into the station .
where were you ? we were so worried .
i didn &apos;t have my phone with me yesterday .
and when i got home last night , the cops were waiting for me .
but i told them everything that we agreed on .
everything .
then why are you so upset ?
because if it wasn &apos;t for me ,
we wouldn &apos;t be at the wrong place at the wrong time ,
and it could haunt us forever .
em , it &apos;s fine . okay ?
we &apos;ve dealt with it .
i saw you guys at school yesterday ,
and all i could think about was because of me--
no because of you , nothing . okay ?
nobody saw us ,
and if we just stick to our story , we are in the clear .
i remembered something ... about that night .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s all you remember ?
i found out online that some people forget things
because they don &apos;t want to remember .
and if this is selective ,
then anything can trigger it--
sights , smells , sounds .
so the car that you saw ,
it just looked like the car from that night ,
or was the car ?
i don &apos;t know .
i started to walk towards it because i wanted to look inside ,
but ... i got a text .
and the person that sent it to me knows i don &apos;t remember
what happened .
&quot; i bet you remember me . &quot;
guys , is it starting again ?
no . you guys , that &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
mona is &quot; a , &quot;
and she &apos;s drooling in her bed at a nut hospital .
we don &apos;t know that for sure .
yeah , we do .
i &apos;ve been visiting her .
what ?
i didn &apos;t tell you guys
because i knew you &apos;d think i &apos;m crazy .
yeah .
she tried to kill you , hanna .
she &apos;s locked up in a room with bars over her windows .
trust me , she doesn &apos;t know anything that happened that night .
yeah , well , someone does .
there &apos;s something i need to show you guys .
ali &apos;s shrine is right over there ...
and then over here she had a row of black hoodies
all just perfectly hanging ,
ready for &quot; a &quot; to grab one and run .
mona .
ready for mona .
yeah .
and there was a zombie costume hanging on the back of that door .
just like the one that attacked ali on halloween .
o @-@ okay , so you &apos;ve been coming here all summer
trying to remember what was in this room . why ?
we have to tell emily the truth .
the morning after they found mona &apos;s body ,
we came back here .
yeah , to get rid of everything .
i know . you told me .
we lied to you .
we didn &apos;t want it to be another thing you had to worry about .
when we came back here , it was empty .
the file cabinets , the maps , pictures ,
ali &apos;s diaries-- everything was gone .
maybe the police took it .
if the police found out
what mona knows about us ,
my mom would be in jail .
yeah , ezra too .
so who took it ?
there are things that don &apos;t really add up .
like mona was with you
when &quot; a &quot; gave emily that massage .
and there &apos;s no way that she could have gotten ian &apos;s body
out of the bell tower by herself .
wait . you &apos;re saying that you think someone was helping her ?
if the black swan wasn &apos;t guilty of something ,
why would she run from you guys ?
&quot; mona played with dolls . i play with body parts . &quot;
&quot; game on , bitches . &quot;
