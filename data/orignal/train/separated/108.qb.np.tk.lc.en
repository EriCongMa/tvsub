安德里亚 · 丹尼斯顿
you &apos;ve been listening to carl orff &apos;s
fier stucke fur xylophon .
xylophones and pan flutes are healing instruments
best played as a detox from the intensity of the day .
shut up .
no .
elsbeth , i &apos;m going into court .
it &apos;s too late to change trial strategy .
you can &apos;t win by fighting sexism .
they &apos;re charging sexism . are you saying i can &apos;t refute it ?
no . yes .
i mean the plaintiff has a broken iphone .
okay . and why is that important ?
because her office sent over files
with five different buck slips .
five different assistants .
mr. napier , hello .
this is my law partner , elsbeth tascioni .
she &apos;ll be my second chair today . that &apos;s my general counsel .
he &apos;s advising me to settle , ms. hecht .
oh , no . you can &apos;t .
our worry is the makeup of the plaintiff &apos;s team .
we &apos;ve looked at their wins and losses ...
that just makes them overconfident .
just give us today . then we can decide whether to settle .
okay , i have business with the governor &apos;s office ,
and their lead attorney is the governor &apos;s wife .
what ? !
alicia !
i didn &apos;t know you were on this .
i didn &apos;t know either .
but i guess i am .
who &apos;s that ?
elsbeth tascioni .
is she good ?
yep .
well , i like the talent pool at j @-@ serve .
i also believe that there aren &apos;t enough women ceos
in the tech business .
so when they approached me , i said yes .
and in the three years you served as ceo at j @-@ serve ,
what happened to the share price ?
it doubled .
so , uh , despite this unprecedented success
and a mere two weeks before your options vested ,
you were unceremoniously terminated ?
objection , your honor ,
to unprecedented success ? calls for a conclusion .
that it does . sustained .
were you given any reason for your firing ?
mr. napier told me that my brash management style
was inconsistent with the company &apos;s culture .
so you &apos;re suing them .
yes .
they fired me because i &apos;m a woman .
and they can &apos;t do that .
thank you .
ms. vargas , how would you describe your relationship
with your subordinates ?
how would i desc ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , um ... effective .
ms. vargas , how many aides have you had in the last two months ?
objection , your honor . relevance .
ms. vargas claims that she was fired due to sexism .
we believe there &apos;s a far simpler explanation .
i guess i will ...
no , i know i will overrule .
ms. vargas , how many aides ?
i don &apos;t know . five .
five assistants in the last two months ?
it &apos;s very hard to find good help .
your honor , please ask the defense to restrain itself .
restrain yourself , ma &apos;am .
ms. vargas ,
have you thrown your cell phone at your assistants ?
objection , your honor .
goes to management skills .
yes . overruled .
you may answer , ma &apos;am .
look , women are called bitches
when they have a tough management style .
i admit i have a tough management style ,
but i am fair .
that was a good pivot on their part .
yep , it &apos;s no longer about sexism .
it &apos;s about our client being a bitch .
so we make it about the ceo before her .
compare their behavior .
yeah , he &apos;s the same and they didn &apos;t fire him .
diane , you knew the ceo before camilla .
what was his name ?
um , everett tatum .
wasn &apos;t there a sexual harassment suit against him ?
there was . i &apos;ll e @-@ mail it to you .
what ? !
computers are down . who did it ?
what happened ? what &apos;s going on here ?
dean , alicia .
wire a payment of $ 50,000
to the following account number within 72 hours
or the decryption key will be destroyed and your files
permanently lost .
ah ... ransomware .
it was an e @-@ mail from alicia . i just clicked on it .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t send you anything .
i just lost my deposition ... !
need some help here !
my computer &apos;s frozen !
this isn &apos;t good .
it &apos;s everything . all our backup files ,
all our accounts . everything &apos;s lost .
we &apos;re due in court in an hour and we can &apos;t get our trial notes .
what happens if we don &apos;t pay ?
everything gets deleted in 72 hours .
71 hours .
it &apos;s on our laptops , too ?
everything &apos;s on the same network .
that &apos;s insane .
this is like modern day piracy . where &apos;s cary ?
here .
no , agos , cary .
uh , he &apos;s at lunch .
i &apos;ll conference him in .
it &apos;s your phone .
yep .
they know i &apos;m at lunch . it can &apos;t be good news .
well , maybe they &apos;re dropping the charges against you .
it &apos;s cary .
cary , we &apos;ve had a malware attack .
all our computers are down .
they &apos;re asking for $ 50,000
or we lose all our files in 71 hours .
what ?
wait , we need to loop kalinda in .
they &apos;re calling you , they &apos;re calling ... they &apos;re calling you .
mute your phone .
where is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about the backup files ?
oh , yeah . we can restore from backup .
hi . this is kalinda .
kalinda , it &apos;s me .
i inadvertently downloaded a virus .
the instructions say we need to make a payment of $ 50,000 .
and we don &apos;t have a backup .
what do you mean we don &apos;t have any backup ?
we were contracting for an outside i.t. redesign ,
but we had to use the money for ... something else .
my bail .
look , what &apos;s the time frame ?
71 hours .
okay , i &apos;ll look into it .
we don &apos;t have time .
we &apos;re in court . they are holding our case files ransom .
we have to pay .
$ 50,000 ? seriously ?
we don &apos;t have any option , all right ? it &apos;s our files ...
we could contact the authorities .
and then what ?
the investigation leaks and the whole legal community
knows we &apos;re vulnerable.- clients will leave .
camilla could even sue us if she thinks this impacts
her representation .
which it might .
i &apos;m with alicia .
we need to pay up .
kalinda , is there anything to do ?
look , i don &apos;t like funding a criminal operation .
i know . and if this were lockhart / gardner ,
we would have other options .
i just don &apos;t see any .
where does the $ 50,000 come from ?
all of us .
all of the partners , $ 5,000 each in two hours .
i agree with diane .
finn , hi .
wow , you sound anxious .
yeah .
firm politics .
so i considered it carefully
and i &apos;d be honored to offer a few remarks on your behalf
when you announce your candidacy .
are you sure ?
uh , that won &apos;t hurt you there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not sure of anything these days .
i like living on the edge .
me , too .
if i fall , you &apos;ll catch me ?
no , i &apos;ll be plummeting with you .
who was your chief executive officer before camilla ?
everett tatum ,
a very capable executive .
you didn &apos;t fire mr. tatum , did you ?
no , there was no reason to .
because his brash
management style didn &apos;t clash with the company &apos;s culture ?
well , he didn &apos;t make us vulnerable to a lawsuit .
they &apos;re going after equivalence .
this is an employee complaint
filed against everett tatum for sexual harassment .
have you seen this ?
no .
you were cc &apos;d there . do you see ?
mr. tatum wasn &apos;t fired , was he ?
no .
in fact , two months after this incident ,
you offered him a 20 % raise , didn &apos;t you ?
so a white male is rewarded for the same behavior that ...
objection , your honor .
what is she objecting to ?
i haven &apos;t finished the question yet .
go ahead .
a white male is rewarded for the same behavior
that leads to a woman &apos;s firing .
objection .
i &apos;ll withdraw .
thank you , sir .
now what ?
i can &apos;t even begin to guess .
mr. napier ,
isn &apos;t it true that mr. everett &apos;s ...
excuse me . what was his last name ?
the previous ceo ?
mr. tatum .
right .
isn &apos;t it true that whatever he did ,
you became concerned about the next ceo
repeating that behavior ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
well , the defense is trying to suggest
there was sexism in your firing of camilla .
i like that brooch .
they &apos;re suggesting there was sexism in firing her
and not firing the male ceo for the exact same actions .
didn &apos;t the misbehavior of the mr. other ceo guy
just sensitize you to not letting camilla do the same thing
and encourage you to say , never again ?
objection .
that is the definition of leading .
yes . i will sustain that .
so , why did you fire camilla ?
well ... because we said , never again ?
thank you , sir .
we need to take her out .

and just like that ,
we turn $ 50,000 in cash into zeroes and ones .
who knew bitcoin would come in so handy ?
how are you entering it ?
i type in my nine @-@ digit routing number
and they e @-@ mail me the decryption key .
okay .
how long do we wait ?
i don &apos;t know .
it says simultaneously .
something &apos;s wrong .
so what do we do ?
bottom of the page , there &apos;s a helpline number .
there &apos;s a helpline for ransomware ?
that &apos;s helpful of the criminals .
thank you for calling the trojanlock help desk .
at present , we are assisting other customers .
please have your routing number ready , and you will be assisted
in the order you called .
amazing .
uh , kalinda ...
see what you can do .
okay .
i &apos;ve re @-@ tabbed the depo testimony for the rest of our cross @-@ exams .
wow , this must have been what it was like
to practice law before computers .
yup .
so , camilla-- she really fired five of her assistants ?
i can say this because i &apos;m a woman ,
but she &apos;s probably a bitch on wheels .
but her behavior wouldn &apos;t even be a talking point
if she were a man .
do you really want to compare experiences of bias ?
tascioni-- what are we gonna do about her ?
she &apos;s killing us .
what ?
alicia ... why aren &apos;t you answering your e @-@ mails ?
eli , i &apos;m working . can we do this another time ?
thank you very much , peter , for that warm introduction .
i hope you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll go easy
on your administration now .
it was a joke , eli . that &apos;s all .
i &apos;d also like to thank asa polmar
for saying such nice words .
yes .
what ?
he &apos;s introducing you ?
finn is ?
yes .
no , he isn &apos;t .
yes , he said he would .
well , of course he said he would .
it puts him on the world stage .
eli , obviously this matters to you
because you &apos;re here , but for the life of me ,
i can &apos;t figure out what your problem is .
you have the governor of the great state of illinois introducing you .
then you have an asa from a tiny division
of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office introducing you , too ?
he &apos;s a hero , eli . he was shot in the line of duty .
and he works under my opponent castro .
elfman thinks it looks good that he endorsed me .
then tell finn he can endorse you at an inner @-@ city event
with 20 people at some stinky high school gym ,
not in front of the national press .
what national press ?
this is an event ,
alicia ... uh , uh , maybe you &apos;re not reading your own press .
people like this story . they &apos;re paying attention .
you &apos;re the new power couple from obama &apos;s home state .
it &apos;s broken through to the msm .
oh , don &apos;t say msm , please .
tell finn he has been disinvited .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can . you &apos;re running for office .
you can do whatever you like . why are all the computers here counting down ?
i feel like i &apos;m in a bruckheimer movie .
wait , if i don &apos;t disinvite finn ...
peter won &apos;t come ?
peter has the governor &apos;s conference .
he has allotted time to endorse you .
he wants to endorse you ,
he does not want to share the stage with an asa .
so he won &apos;t come ? seriously ?
tell finn he can endorse you at a later event .
you need peter .
you do not need finn .
thanks for seeing me .
no problem .
so , you &apos;re moving up in the world .
what do you want , kalinda ?
oh , just to say hello .
no . what do you want ?
my firm has been hit by ransomware .
it &apos;s called trojanlock .
we paid the ransom , but they didn &apos;t send the decryption key .
hmm . tough break .
the account number i wired it to--
can you trace it ?
with a warrant .
i only have 45 hours .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
it &apos;ll take 48 hours to get a warrant .
okay . thanks .
i don &apos;t like that i only see you when you need something .
look , i don &apos;t like it either .
then ... stop it .
how have you been ?
i &apos;ll call you .
am i being dismissed ?
you &apos;re being dismissed .
hello , my name is bruce .
thank you for holding . may i help you ?
uh , yes . i made a $ 50,000 payment
and i &apos;m still awaiting an e @-@ mail with a decryption key .
let me check on your order status .
yes , here we are .
as requested , that decryption key
was e @-@ mailed to lockhart @ lockhartandgardner.com
oh , no , it ...
i think when i filled out the form ,
it auto @-@ filled with my old e @-@ mail address .
i need the key sent to my new address .
i &apos;m so sorry ,
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re only permitted to
send the decryption key to one address .
it &apos;s the only way to safeguard its security .
you &apos;re kidding . you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re ransoming my business
and this is where you draw the line ?
will there be anything else , ma &apos;am ?
uh , yes . i would like to speak to the supervisor .
it went to lockhart / gardner .
oh , dear god , this is like a nightmare .
we need to call them .
are you serious ?
david lee .
hello , david . it &apos;s diane .
ah , diane . forget something on the way out ,
like the silverware ?
david , i , um ...
i &apos;m awaiting an important e @-@ mail
that was inadvertently sent to my l.g. e @-@ mail address ,
and i need you to do me the courtesy of forwarding it .
certainly , just as soon as monkeys fly out of my butt .
well , that was fairly crass .
i &apos;ve been holding it back all these years .
nice talking to you , diane .
uh , d @-@ david , wait .
what do you want ?
what do i want ?
two clients .
no .
tell you what ,
why don &apos;t you come over and prostrate yourself
and maybe we &apos;ll work something out .
can we at least get a bucket in here ?
dana lee boykin .
i was a flight attendant on azo charter .
and this is a private jet line that serves mr. napier ?
yes .
did you ever overhear a conversation
between mr. napier and the plaintiff ?
objection , your honor ; hearsay .
this isn &apos;t being offered for the truth of the matter .
this goes to impeachment .
that is true . i will allow .
yes , i did hear a phone call .
and what did mr. napier
say at the end of this phone call ?
he said , i &apos;ve got enough of this at home .
the bitch is driving me crazy .
and one week later , camilla vargas was fired .
no further questions , your honor .
i got this .
n ... let &apos;s call a recess .
it &apos;s okay .
ms. boykin , do you still work for ...
azo charter ?
no , i don &apos;t .
so , you were ...
i was ... ?
you ...
do you have a question , ms. tascioni ?
do i ? yes , i do .
do you want to ask it ?
i don &apos;t even like penguins .
excuse me ?
penguins .
they have nothing to do with this .
your honor , we request a recess .
let &apos;s talk .
settlement ? as long as it &apos;s seven figures .
i &apos;ll call you .
mr. elfman .
mrs. florrick .
eli talked to you ?
he did .
you think i should ask finn not to introduce me ?
i think if it means losing the governor &apos;s introduction , yes .
finn went out on a limb for me .
i agree . so ask him to endorse you later .
i don &apos;t like it .
well , i don &apos;t like asking you .
but , unfortunately , this is the beginning
of a long line of distasteful acts .
every single one of them a step towards maturity .
maturity of what ?
of being a good state &apos;s attorney .
do you always just wait here ?
i just saw your car pull up .
what &apos;s up ?
how many hours do you have left ?
forty @-@ three .
the ip address to the computer your money was sent to .
a mr. kellner .
thanks .
yeah .
the next time you come visit me ...
come visit me , okay ?
when ?
you want to talk or you want me to ?
you . use me if it gets violent .
mr. kellner , open the door . it &apos;s a federal agent .
what did i do ? i didn &apos;t do anything .
i got an e @-@ mail .
they said i can earn money at home .
who said this ?
it was mr. black at this cosmetics firm .
布莱克先生 钱在我手上 能面谈吗
they wire money into my account .
i get ten percent . $ 1,500 a week .
then the rest of the money goes into another account .
you wire it into another account ?
i don &apos;t do anything . it &apos;s all automated .
they &apos;re using you as a money mule .
a what ?
a middleman for a ransomware operation .
you &apos;re laundering money , sir .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m gonna have to take your computer .
all right , go ahead .
take it . take everything ,
i don &apos;t care .
diane .
sorry if i don &apos;t get up . sciatica .
i made a few changes to the decor .
your chair squeaked horribly , by the way .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t knock down a wall or two .
oh , i still might . we &apos;re having quite a quarter .
about this e @-@ mail ...
you opened it ?
no , but it is the property of lockhart / gardner ,
so it wouldn &apos;t be strange for me to open it and read it .
it &apos;s nothing , david .
it matters to me , not to lockhart / gardner .
really ? then i have a proposal .
of course you do .
it &apos;s to your benefit , too . the lease .
what lease ? this lease ?
yes , to these offices-- the 27th , 28th floor .
it &apos;s still under your name , yours and will &apos;s , but ...
on his passing , it reverted to you .
and as you can see , you no longer work here , so ...
we ask that you pass the lease to mr. canning and myself .
really ?
i don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
it makes no sense for you to act as sub @-@ lessor .
makes no sense for you to hold on to my e @-@ mail ,
but here we are .
exactly .
so let &apos;s trade-- give us the lease and here you go .
no .
diane ...
i &apos;ll rip it up .
do it . but you &apos;ll never get the lease .
i might even kick you out .
don &apos;t call my bluff .
go ahead , david-- it &apos;s a copy of an e @-@ mail .
the paper doesn &apos;t matter .
give me the e @-@ mail ,
and i will discuss a transfer of the lease .
that is my best offer .
b-
4 @-@ 6 @-@ j @-@ q-
7 @-@ 9 .
david lee really gave you back your e @-@ mail ?
i was surprised , too .
here goes .
it &apos;s not working .
hit enter again .
you have a better idea ?
nothing &apos;s happening .
something is-- look at the time code .
you &apos;re kidding-- it &apos;s counting down twice as fast .
imagine that .
there &apos;s no honor among thieves .
so what do we do ?
it &apos;s not working , kalinda .
well , what happened ?
we tried the decryption key ,
now the time code is counting down twice as fast .
i &apos;m getting on with the helpline .
no . they &apos;ll ask for more money .
you have a lead ?
our money was sent through a money mule
to somewhere in russia .
how do you know ?
i have a friend who contacted
the russian service provider .
a friend ?
thanks a lot .
how did he do that , your friend ?
it &apos;s a federal agent .
trojanlock is working through a proxy ,
but we have the money mule &apos;s hard drive ,
so we &apos;re coordinating access times .
good . great .
where are you , kalinda ?
uh , home .
you want me to come over ?
uh , maybe later .
i &apos;m ... working for a while .
sure . sounds good .
i told my mom i was gay .
it was ... hard .
she doesn &apos;t like all that stuff .
she thinks i &apos;ll end up on a float with a transvestite nun .
and then , you know , a month later , she dies .
she lived just long enough to be disappointed in me .
do you have the , um ...
access times in russia ?
are you listening to anything that i am saying at all ?
yes .
did you tell your parents that you &apos;re gay ?
lana ...
what ?
i can &apos;t do this .
do what ?
talk ?
no .
talk about this .
sure .
$ 5 million ,
and her options are backdated to the date of her hire .
to the date of her firing ,
and we can &apos;t go higher - than $ 3 million .
rayna , we &apos;ve proven sexism .
understanding that after tomorrow ,
our settlement demands are increased by ...
$ 3 million .
i can go to four ,
and i &apos;ll split the calendar difference on the options .
best i can do .
no .
we don &apos;t want to settle .
look , if we take another hit at trial ,
the settlement value &apos;s only gonna increase .
we won &apos;t take another hit .
i won &apos;t be distracted again .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
how long did you negotiate this ?
no .
how long did you negotiate with j @-@ serve
this ... this ...
* here i am , a clown in your mind . *
stop it .
this joint venture ,
how long were you in negotiations ?
good .
stay there .
context . your honor ,
i am supplying context for the sexism .
ready .
mr. shin ...
how long did wong @-@ tei gaming
negotiate its joint venture
with j @-@ serve ?
six months .
but the deal did not close .
really ? why not ?
we ended our interest after discussions with ms. vargas
in beijing .
i see .
and why did you ...
let me try that again .
why did you end your interest
in a joint venture after meeting with camilla ?
she was very loud-- interrupted our chairman often ,
refused to pour tea , and she drank too much .
so during your negotiations with her ,
she basically acted like a man ?
objection , your honor-- relevance .
context , your honor .
j @-@ serve worked with sexist companies in china .
that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re sexist
for requiring ms. vargas to work with them .
oh , come on ! your honor ,
is the defense really saying ,
&quot; hey , we &apos;re sexist , but the chinese made us do it &quot; ?
no . we &apos;re saying our client made a decision
based on the sexism of an outside business partner . that &apos;s all .
hm . novel . i will allow .
hey , next state &apos;s attorney .
hi . the office said you &apos;d be here .
oh , so you &apos;re here to see me ?
well , this is the asa bar ,
and they , uh , they don &apos;t like defense attorneys here .
shot of tequila , please .
good . you &apos;re not driving today .
why would you say that ?
well , last time you didn &apos;t want to have a drink .
oh . right .
so ...
i have given it a lot of thought ,
and i can &apos;t ask you to endorse me .
alicia , i already decided .
no . it hurts you with castro .
and i &apos;m fine with that .
no . maybe i &apos;ll ask you later ,
but i am cancelling you for monday .
what &apos;s going on , alicia ?
i just ...
i &apos;m asking too much of you .
no , you &apos;re not .
do you not want me to endorse you ?
no , i do .
but ... ?
what , you &apos;re worried about the photo of us ?
no , that &apos;s easily explained .
you were at my apartment doing witness prep .
right . then , uh ...
your husband ?
no .
okay , well , then here &apos;s the thing .
i am endorsing you because i &apos;m inherently selfish ,
and i think that you &apos;ll make a great state &apos;s attorney .
so don &apos;t think that i &apos;m sacrificing anything .
i want to endorse you .
okay .
are you sure ?
i am now .
mr. fong , could you please
explain your management consultant practice ?
yes . i advise american companies on the cultural intricacies
of doing business in mainland china .
and did you advise j @-@ serve after its failed negotiations
with wong @-@ tei gaming ?
yes , i advised them that china is a patriarchal society ,
and having a brash , &quot; bitchy &quot; female ceo was problematic .
so in your opinion , the decision to terminate ms. vargas ,
though facially sexist , could be justified
as a business necessity .
your honor , plaintiff asks for a directed verdict .
on what ground ?
ms. tascioni has expressly conceded
the issue at bar : sexism .
ms. tascioni ? huh ?
anything ?
have you conceded it ?
no .
uh , she &apos;s explained it , your honor .
this case is not about j @-@ serve &apos;s sexism ,
it &apos;s about china &apos;s sexism .
mr. perrotti &apos;s motion ...
i mean
mrs. florrick &apos;s motion--
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
i am visualizing stillness over here .
what are you doing here , mr. perrotti ?
josh .
god , watching you work .
i &apos;m tingling .
no . don &apos;t tingle . no tingling .
you &apos;re here to rattle me , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
i &apos;m here on business . but ...
am i rattling you ?
no . i &apos;m just saying ...
what business ?
have dinner with me tonight , and i &apos;ll tell you .
no . stop it .
why not ?
i don &apos;t like that you &apos;re corrupt .
i &apos;m an ausa .
i have the full faith of the united states government behind me .
and i think ...
you are so sexy with your red hair .
not too much time to spare .
how do you know russian ?
uh , my mom she forced us to learn to play the piano or a language .
and you chose russian ?
i thought it sounded cool .
okay , so i &apos;m gonna be ratting this computer ,
so this may get angry .
&quot; ratting &quot; ?
yeah . remotely administering his webcam . ready ?
hey , you !
yeah , you ! schmuck !
schmuck !
how are you ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m kalinda , and you , boris ivankov ,
are a cyber @-@ terrorist .
nyet . no .
i &apos;m an entrepreneur .
but you &apos;re not a very good entrepreneur ,
because i just ratted your computer .
how very exciting for you .
you held our files for ransom .
we paid you ,
and you &apos;re still threatening to erase them .
now , return our money
and unlock our computers immediately ,
or i &apos;m gonna delete your hard drive .
i decline
perhaps you didn &apos;t hear me .
destroy my network . i will just go on to another one .
go to the politsiya .
they will not care .
的歌曲被警方逮捕
uh ... what are you doing ?
oh , you speak english .
it &apos;s a pussy riot protest .
i know what is this .
this is not mine .
what about this ?
oh , no , no , no . no , no , no , no . this is wrong .
it &apos;s true . the politsiya doesn &apos;t care
about our little chicago law firm , but they do
care about anti @-@ putin propaganda .
ooh ! yeah ! we &apos;re live .
we got it . we got it .
we &apos;re back on line .
so , this is a question of first impression .
is cultural relativism a bar to a claim
of sexual discrimination , or is it tantamount to an admission
that should end these ...
... proceedings ?
miss tascioni ,
is there a problem ?
what ? no , judge .
i ... i &apos;m being stalked .
excuse me ?
that man in the gallery over there ,
josh perotti he &apos;s a stalker .
sir , if you don &apos;t have any business in my courtroom ...
actually , your honor , i do .
i am ausa perotti , and
i have a federal warrant here to stop these proceedings .
for what cause ?
pending the disposition of federal criminal charges
against j @-@ serve for theft of trade secrets .
the company &apos;s assets have been frozen .
theft of trade secrets ? you &apos;re charging the company with a felony .
j @-@ serve has stolen millions of dollars
of intellectual property , judge .
the civil suit can &apos;t proceed until the criminal case
has been resolved .
peter &apos;s introductory remarks will last approximately five minutes ,
and he won &apos;t stay on stage during alicia &apos;s speech .
he won &apos;t ?
no .
where will he stay ?
just over there , in the wings , waiting for her to finish .
you &apos;re afraid of repeating the scandal photo .
we don &apos;t want peter to be seen in a weaker spousal position .
mr. governor , we won &apos;t garner the press coverage
we want without you staying on stage , sir .
i don &apos;t think you have to worry .
there &apos;ll be enough attention .
is this about the sun @-@ times polling ?
it &apos;s about us wanting the governor to appear strong .
no one is taking that poll seriously , sir .
alicia &apos;s not in competition with you .
her favorables are only higher
because she hasn &apos;t started running .
sorry . court ran long .
oh , no , perfect timing .
listen , we were coordinating for the endorsement .
you don &apos;t mind if i introduce you and then watch the rest
of your speech from the wings , do you ?
no . if you don &apos;t mind if finn introduces me , too .
i @-@ i &apos;m just gonna ...
we should , uh ... yeah .
how much is the governor really gonna help , eli ?
i don &apos;t know . let &apos;s see .
why are you insisting on this ?
i &apos;m not insisting on anything .
i asked finn to introduce me
when we all thought it was a good idea .
he said &quot; yes , &quot; despite his standing
in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
what standing in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
so , i am not now going to tell him ,
&quot; sorry , but it &apos;s inconvenient for me . &quot;
even if he &apos;s the only one introducing you ?
seriously , peter ?
i stand beside you at every damn event .
you go off banging prostitutes two at a time , and ...
all right , you don &apos;t want to go there .
... and i stood beside you like a grinning fool !
would you let it go ?
for god &apos;s sakes , let it go !
for your own good , even if you don &apos;t believe it .
for the very fact that i &apos;m the governor ,
and you &apos;re asking me for a favor-- let it go !
is that what i &apos;m doing here ? i &apos;m asking you for a @-@ a favor ?
yes , you are .
you want something . that &apos;s a favor .
no .
and you know why it &apos;s not ?
because if you don &apos;t show up to endorse me ,
if you go off to some governor &apos;s conference instead ,
your favorables will plummet through the floor .
on the day that you want to be talking about pensions ,
every question will be about the state of your marriage .
yes , i may need you , peter ,
but you sure as hell need me , too .
i need you , but i don &apos;t need finn polmar .
well , suck it up , peter ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s part of the deal !
really ?
who &apos;s the one sucking it up ?
endorse me or not , peter .
i don &apos;t really care , but i &apos;m out of here .
do what you want .
we need you to team up to beat this federal case .
oh , god .
you &apos;re serious ?
yes .
the alleged theft of trade secrets happened
under your watch , ma &apos;am .
your cooperation with j @-@ serve defense is crucial .
to you . if our client
goes bankrupt on this case ,
you collect pennies on the dollar .
but if you help us beat the feds ,
we can pick up where we left off .
that &apos;s a lot of ifs .
yes , but what choice do you have ?
oh , no . that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it !
everything all right ?
no . alicia , we can &apos;t stay here .
it &apos;s not working .
diane , we signed the lease .
um , breach of contract , lessor fraud .
we &apos;ll find something ,
but , i mean , look around .
it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s a roach @-@ infested wreck , alicia !
the infrastructure &apos;s rotten , we &apos;re in a lousy neighborhood .
isn &apos;t that part of the romance of a startup ?
no . cockroaches are not romantic .
where would we go , even if we could get the lease annulled ?
what if i controlled a prime space
i could get my hands on at a submarket rate ?
okay .
lockhart / gardner ?
it &apos;s a lease assignment agreement .
i &apos;m supposed to deed over my interest to david lee .
but ...
i &apos;m not going to .
someone &apos;s turned on .
you &apos;re bad .
how am i bad ?
j @-@ serve .
what is that ?
you spend the night , and then , the next day ,
the feds sweep in
with an indictment for j @-@ serve .
are you suggesting i got it from you ?
no . from the files on my desk .
just because you would do it , kalinda ,
doesn &apos;t mean that i would .
no ... but you did .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you .
look , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine .
allow me to be brutally honest with you .
i was not looking for another candidate to endorse ,
and i was not looking to get into politics .
but then , well , i met alicia florrick .
do i say something about peter ?
about him not showing ? no .
i &apos;ll talk to them after .
spin it .
you all right ?
i &apos;m nervous . why are there so few people ?
that &apos;s a lot . that &apos;s two national crews ,
three local , and 20 of my people .
they &apos;ll clap loud .
it &apos;ll feel bigger once it &apos;s broadcast .
all the viewers see is the front row .
keep your eyes towards the rear of the room .
it &apos;ll make it seem like there &apos;s thousands .
oh , god . my stomach . i feel sick .
just like being in court . opening arguments .
okay ? here we go . he &apos;s wrapping it up .
ladies and gentlemen , the next state &apos;s attorney
for cook county , alicia florrick .
sorry i &apos;m late . how you doing ?
good . this is a surprise .
i &apos;m just being a supportive spouse .
thank you .
my pleasure .
thank you all .
forgive me for , uh , stealing the limelight ,
for a second , from alicia .
i just needed to
add to mr. polmar &apos;s very fine remarks .
let me , uh , just say that
i have not met a more fair
and honest person than my wife , alicia florrick .
there are those who know justice in their bones .
they don &apos;t need to be taught right and wrong .
they live it every day .
thank you .
