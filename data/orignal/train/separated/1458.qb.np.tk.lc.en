good morning !
there &apos;s the birthday boy !
65 candles on one cake .
this is a big day for you ...
and for the astronauts who can see it from space .
happy birthday to you .
thank you . and just so everyone knows , i want a quiet day .
no surprises .
no surprises .
last night , i found out that i am pregnant ,
so jay &apos;s gonna get one big surprise .
okay , two if you count
the barbecue apron with the bikini body on it .
i don &apos;t blame you , jay .
you &apos;d had enough excitement in one lifetime--
the dawn of flight , printed books , agriculture .
all right , what &apos;s with all the jokes ?
it &apos;s insult comedy .
i &apos;ve been watching old dean martin roasts online .
like this guy knows from the internet .
the other morning ,
i saw him looking for the crank on the front of his car .
okay , you &apos;re done .
i make fun , and we laugh .
but in all seriousness ,
if you see a light today , don &apos;t walk towards it .
i &apos;m sorry i was asleep when you got home .
cam and mitch must be disappointed .
they were really geared up to get that kid .
but there &apos;s a silver lining .
you might be right . babies are a lot of work .
no , that &apos;s not what i mean .
i &apos;m--
ah , you know , and these two aren &apos;t getting any younger .
the last thing they need is to start over .
would that be so bad ?
hey , jay .
what are you doing ?
what the heck is that ?
what ?
get him !
jay has been very explicit
about what he wants to do for his 65th birthday ,
but phil dunphy reads between the lines .
what the hell is going on ? ! what are you doing ? !
making your birthday dreams comes true .
it &apos;s your special day , buddy .
should we put him in the trunk ?
why would we put him in the trunk ?
you said there were no bad ideas .
get this stupid thing off me !
i thought you said the hood would calm him down .
it works with my falcon .
don &apos;t worry , gloria . we &apos;ll have him back in time for dinner .
which for him is at 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
&apos;cause he &apos;s old ! i love it !
this is really good coffee .
it really is .
ahh . is it a medium roast or ...
uh , dark .
oh . i was gonna say dark . i don &apos;t know why i said medium .
well , you would &apos;ve been right .
is it whole milk or ...
2 % .
2 % .
okay . this is ridiculous .
we need to talk about the elephant in the room .
the giant stuffed elephant
was a gift from our good friend pepper .
gay guys having kids is-- it &apos;s relatively new ,
so our community has not yet learned
how to modulate baby gifts .
when steven and stefan had little rocco ,
our friend longinus sent over
the whole cast of &quot; yo gabba gabba . &quot;
now rocco cries whenever he sees bright colors .
i &apos;m not allowed over there .
i guess we should donate it somewhere ,
along with the 800 @-@ pound gorilla .
i mean , you know , now that we &apos;re not getting a baby .
a decision , by the way ,
which seems even better in the light of day .
mm . no , i totally agree .
so we &apos;re good ?
no , we &apos;re great .
we couldn &apos;t have handled this any better .
no .
where &apos;s my new baby brother ?
okay . uh , slight oversight .
can i see him ? can we name him larry ?
okay , sweetie . here , have a seat with us .
um , listen .
there &apos;s something we need to tell you .
is it about larry ?
well , uh , yes . uh , sort of .
um , it--it turns out that ... we &apos;re not getting a baby .
yeah , and i know this-- this makes you very sad ,
but i promise you we &apos;re still a family--
can i have a kitten ?
a kitten ?
if i can &apos;t have a brother ,
then i want a kitten named larry .
okay , w @-@ what &apos;s this about ? is larry on a show ?
he &apos;s not , which is what &apos;s weird .
ooh ! how was prom ?
so fun .
michael and i danced all night ...
and then we stayed after and helped clean up ,
which was awesome
because i got to meet next year &apos;s trig teacher .
that is not the prom i remember .
i have such a bad headache !
that &apos;s the prom i remember .
were you drinking ?
mom , do we really have to do this ?
you ask if i was drinking , i say &quot; no , &quot;
and we both know that that &apos;s not true .
i mean , aren &apos;t we past this point in our relationship ?
no , young lady , we are not .
then i wasn &apos;t drinking .
me neither , mrs . d.
dear god . tell me he did not spend the night here .
mom , do we really have to do this ?
mom , i have a big decision to make
about poetry camp this summer .
is this about the walking sticks again ?
pack them all and decide when you &apos;re there .
i can either focus on sonnets or free verse .
i &apos;ve always fancied myself a sonneteer ,
but i &apos;m thinking the free verse girls
will be freer with everything ,
if you catch my meaning .
hmm ? ay . i &apos;m sorry , manny .
i &apos;m sure you will make the right decision .
are you okay ? you seem distracted .
manny , sit down . i have to tell you something .
what ?
i am pregnant .
you &apos;re what ?
i &apos;m going to have a baby .
wow .
what ?
you &apos;re not happy ?
yeah . sure .
it &apos;s just a lot to take in .
and i &apos;ll be honest , this isn &apos;t coming at a great time for me ,
with everything i &apos;ve got going on .
this is not your responsibility .
neither is our wooden salad bowl ,
but i &apos;m the only one who oils it .
without me , that thing would soak up dressing like a sponge .
manny , i can take care of a baby .
i took care of you .
please . i was an anomaly . i self @-@ potty trained .
i just did not get the appeal
of intentionally soiling one &apos;s pants .
that said ,
i will admit to missing the kisses on my tummy .
how did jay take it ?
i haven &apos;t been able to tell him yet .
he might not be too thrilled .
do you think ? i was starting to wonder the same thing .
he doesn &apos;t deal well with change .
i know .
he still checks the front step for the evening paper .
don &apos;t worry , mom . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll adapt .
although , he still does call the remote the &quot; clicker . &quot;
ay , yeah .
i &apos;m bored , daddy . make the car dance .
all right . but just for a second , all right ?
do it again .
no . once was enough .
if i can &apos;t have a brother , then i want the car to dance .
wow , you are really comfortable playing that card .
they wouldn &apos;t take &apos; em .
they were afraid they might have bedbugs .
are you serious ? they rejected our donation ?
i was so offended ,
i almost didn &apos;t buy this fiestaware creamer .
2 bucks .
didn &apos;t know what they had .
ah ! score .
so what are we gonna do now ?
get a kitten and then name it larry .
lily , honey , this is hardly the day to get a kitten , okay ?
would you just tell her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i kinda want one now .
you know , we have been through a lot ,
and maybe the presence of a cuddly little friend
will help us ease the pain .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is ,
you have a child @-@ shaped hole in your heart ,
and your plan is to cram a cat into there ?
he has a name .
i can &apos;t wait till your eyes adjust to the light ,
and we see the look on your face .
i hate you guys .
hey , phil , you ever think about growing a beard ?
i mean , you got the face for it .
you think ?
yeah .
that &apos;s funny . i always thought so , but my wife doesn &apos;t .
oh , what does she know ?
come on , you got a great nose , those deep @-@ set eyes .
i mean , you would look good .
thanks , shorty .
在戏外经常以大胡子形象示人 &#93;
it &apos;s , uh , sort of a jon hamm in between projects .
okay , put me back in the trunk .
relax , you &apos;re almost there .
nope , i &apos;m done now !
hey , jay , no !
no ! no ! no ! hey !
jay ! jay !
jay !
son of a bitch !
somebody help me !
i would , but--but these pants are cashmere !
i got you , jay !
you gotta calm him down !
punch him in the head !
don &apos;t punch him in the head !
don &apos;t make me punch you ! i will punch you to save you !
i think i &apos;m being waterboarded .
you &apos;re making me do this !
get this thing off me !
happy birthday .
we &apos;re taking you fishing .
for whatever it &apos;s worth ,
dylan was very responsible last night .
he &apos;s a good guy to have around the house .
mm . where we going with this ?
well , since i can &apos;t move in with him anymore ,
he can &apos;t afford his apartment .
so i was wondering if it would be okay
if he could stay with us for a couple weeks ?
sure . oh , you know what ?
why don &apos;t you guys take our room ?
she &apos;s being facetious .
sarcastic .
dylan no stay .
what ? !
oh , come on ! he helps out a lot .
he is very handy .
really ? the guy who locked himself in his car ?
you are in no position to be asking for favors , young lady .
here . drink this . it &apos;s for your hangover .
ugh . it smells gross .
well , then you better drink it fast .
ew ! i &apos;m gonna throw up ! ugh ! ugh !
that &apos;s a hangover cure ?
no .
well , this is probably shot .
once again , i &apos;d like to apologize for punching you in the head .
it really was the only way to save you
since you were bound and ... hooded ,
which leads me to my second apology .
gentlemen , come on . as my uncle used to say ,
let &apos;s not let a botched kidnapping ruin our whole afternoon .
he &apos;s right . the whole point of this
is for you to enjoy the lake with your three best friends .
stan coming ?
burn !
so ... 65 , huh ?
you &apos;re heading into the best years of your life .
that &apos;s right .
you put in the work . you climbed the mountain .
now it &apos;s time to reap the rewards .
i guess you &apos;re right .
sounds pretty good to me .
you know , the more i look at you ,
the angrier i get that you don &apos;t got a beard .
i had a soul patch once .
a soul patch ? that &apos;s like a beard &apos;s crap .
i golfed six times last week .
found 42 balls-- a new record .
i don &apos;t think my falcon could have found that many ,
and he can spot a mouse at 600 yards .
whats that have to do with beards ?
i thought we were talking about jay turning 65
and how good that &apos;s gonna be .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s gonna be great , jay .
i &apos;m telling ya . i got a vegetable garden .
two years ago , it was a patch of dirt in my backyard .
now i got tomatoes , i got five kinds of beans ,
i got squash .
and between you and me ,
i &apos;m even thinking about pickling my own cucumbers .
why would that be between you and me ?
because there &apos;s a finite number of pickles .
but don &apos;t worry . all you guys are on the list .
well , i &apos;d like to make a toast .
to jay , who &apos;s not particularly buoyant .
and again , i &apos;m very sorry about that .
but he &apos;s the best father @-@ in @-@ law a guy could ask for .
all right . and we &apos;re--we &apos;re all really lucky to know him . cheers .
here , here .
salud .
thanks , guys . you know what ?
it is kinda nice being out here with all of ya .
hey , let &apos;s do some fishing .
i &apos;m starting to feel better now that i &apos;m finally getting dry .
let &apos;s do this !
let &apos;s go !
all right !
sure .
you know ,
i had a little peppermints schnapps at my prom ,
but i hid it from my parents
and i kicked my boyfriend out before they woke up .
it &apos;s called respect .
i &apos;m pregnant .
you &apos;re gonna get fat .
you--oh ! i mean ...
that &apos;s great . it &apos;s great ! you &apos;re pregnant !
it &apos;s great ! congratulations !
it was a surprise .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet . what did my dad say ?
i haven &apos;t told him yet .
i worry that he &apos;s going to think it &apos;s not such great news .
ohh , no . don &apos;t be silly .
he &apos;s gonna be thrilled .
i knew he wasn &apos;t gonna be thrilled .
and if history was any indication ,
he wasn &apos;t gonna be able to hide it .
it &apos;s a french canadian delicacy called poutine .
mm . well , it looks like vomit ,
so i &apos;m not pou @-@ ting it in my mouth .
we &apos;re here !
what &apos;d you do to your hair ?
i thought i &apos;d try something different .
what , looking old ?
i had to get to dad
before he said something insensitive to gloria .
but she is gonna get really fat , though .
dad , call me back .
i have something very important to tell you
so when you get home you don &apos;t say something stupid
like you usually do .
oh , happy birthday .
yeah . i &apos;ve gotta say ,
you &apos;re handling this baby thing better than i would &apos;ve expected .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re used to being the only kid in the house .
now there &apos;s gonna be a new kid . jay &apos;s kid .
so ?
well , the old manny would &apos;ve been worried
that jay would love the new kid more .
i think you &apos;re underestimating how adorable i am .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re way cuter than a baby .
i &apos;m gonna go check on dinner .
sometimes i just like to toss a grenade and run away .
all right , take a whiff .
make sure you like it ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what our couch is gonna smell like .
okay , hi . yes , we &apos;re gonna take this one .
oh , i &apos;m gonna need you to slow down a bit .
there &apos;s a process we need to go through
to see if you &apos;re a suitable cat guardian .
oh , really ? because i thought the process was ,
i say , &quot; we &apos;ll take this one . &quot;
and then you say , &quot; thank god because we have too many cats . &quot;
no . we need to ensure these cats are going to good homes .
that &apos;s why we need you to fill out this form ,
and then there &apos;ll be a site visit .
okay , um , we &apos;ve just been through a very frustrating year
trying to adopt a baby , so ...
you &apos;ll forgive us if we &apos;re not really in the mood
to jump through too many hoops for a cat .
oh . why wouldn &apos;t they give you a baby ?
it &apos;s complicated .
so are cats .
are they ? &apos; cause that one over there has been licking
itself ever since we got here .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m--i can &apos;t do this .
what about larry ?
i &apos;m sorry , lily . not today .
mitchell stormed off , but i couldn &apos;t .
i had to give her a piece of my mind .
and how &apos;d that go ?
i may have strayed off topic just a bit .
no , sir !
no , she will always be norma jeane baker to me .
what is your point , exactly ?
that like the thrice @-@ married starlet ,
this cat is being deprived a stable home .
i &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re upset .
you &apos;re the one who should be upset , ma &apos;am .
we are animals lovers .
that cat would &apos;ve been on the receiving end of affection
24 hours a day .
satisfying its every need would &apos;ve been our top priority .
okay , in light of that tableau ,
i would like to take back the phrase &quot; receiving end . &quot;
mom , i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m not going to poetry camp .
what ? why not ?
&apos;cause by the time i come back ,
jay will have turned my room into a nursery .
no , he won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not his real kid .
i &apos;ll be as insignificant as a whisper in a windstorm .
oh , listen to you . you have a gift .
you have to go to the poetry camp .
i don &apos;t think i can
manny , please . i have too much to worry about right now .
okay ?
you ?
i dug a pretty big hole for myself
with those insult jokes this morning .
why didn &apos;t i learn from rickles ?
you gotta end with some ticker .
okay , i give up .
i can &apos;t find a position that &apos;s not sexual .
just calm down .
i can &apos;t calm down .
you know , maybe we &apos;re not as okay as we keep saying we are .
i know .
maybe we should go away .
you know , go someplace to heal .
where ?
well , someplace with a vibrant theater scene ...
top @-@ notch restaurants ...
the jewel of missouri &apos;s white river .
we &apos;re not going to branson .
okay , fine . where would you go ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe europe ?
london ?
just somewhere far away .
i &apos;m just sad , cam .
i am , too .
you know , i had our mornings all planned out .
the baby and i would walk lily to kindergarten
and then cut back home through the park
and feed those ducks that you &apos;re not supposed to feed
but everybody does .
i bought a picture frame for my desk ,
and it &apos;s just sitting there ,
waiting for his face .
come here .
i already feel better .
me , too .
see what the power of a hug can do ?
just saved us a long plane ride with a toddler .
and a cat that we didn &apos;t want .
oh , we &apos;re still getting that .
all right , how does this look ?
perfectly innocent . they &apos;re not even touching .
great . okay . let &apos;s go .
all right .
you ready , honey ?
go . go .
hey , mrs. dunphy ?
i heard about what haley asked you , and just so you know ,
i never wanted to put you in that position .
i &apos;ll be fine .
that &apos;s good to know .
my cousin dylan said i could stay at his house .
well , not really at his house .
more like behind it ... in the garage .
okay .
well , actually , there are no walls ,
so it &apos;s more of a porte cochere .
fancy .
anyway , i &apos;ll be sleeping in it .
it &apos;s got a bathroom .
more of a half @-@ bath .
it &apos;s a coffee can .
ohh . anyway , i &apos;ll be fine
once i find a nice tent to protect me from the coyotes .
well , be sure to hang your food up high .
we &apos;re back !
birthday boy &apos;s here !
hey , jay , you &apos;re all wrinkled .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m old . i get it .
no , i mean your clothes .
yeah , when i was your age , i was wearing animal skins .
bam ! you got me .
i think , bam ! you got yourself .
i &apos;m just expressing concern .
let me guess-- about my bone density .
you know , you &apos;re a real smart @-@ ass .
at this rate , i &apos;ll be living in the basement .
lucky .
dad ? dad , okay , quick . just come here one second .
i gotta tell you something .
somebody is about to tell you some very important news .
and for the first time in your life ,
i need you to react nicely .
i always react nicely .
you never do .
and this person in question is very vulnerable right now .
so could you please just be loving and supportive ?
happy birthday , dad !
oh , thank you .
that &apos;s a boy .
sorry we &apos;re late , but it &apos;s for a good reason .
we &apos;re thinking about getting a cat .
well , isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
i &apos;m thrilled for you both . this is a heck of a decision .
you have my full support .
okay .
i think it &apos;ll be a perfect addition to the family .
i know i &apos;ll love the heck out of the little bugger .
i &apos;m just hoping that little one over there doesn &apos;t get jealous .
oh , this little one will be just fine
now that he knows where he stands--
in the shadow of your new baby !
what &apos;s he talking about ?
he &apos;s talking about i am pregnant .
oh , come on !
pregnant ? !
you gotta be kidding me !
oh , gross . i didn &apos;t know grandpa could still do it .
don &apos;t be disrespectful , luke .
anyone could do it with gloria .
and if you &apos;re too set in your old ways to be happy about it ,
i can raise it on my own .
i have done it before , and i can do it now !
i come from a very long line of strong latin women
whose husbands are nowhere to be found !
are you done ?
yes !
can i say something ?
go on !
that &apos;s the greatest news i &apos;ve ever heard .
it is ?
i spent the day hearing what my future had in store for me ,
and i didn &apos;t like one bit of it .
it felt like my life was ending .
and now you &apos;re telling me that i get to have a new start ...
with the woman of my dreams .
i think i &apos;m gonna cry .
i &apos;m way ahead of you .
can you believe this ?
i know . they wouldn &apos;t even let us get a cat .
it &apos;s gonna be great !
i &apos;m gonna get so fat .
mostly great .
oh , gross . they &apos;re at it again .
if you don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t look .
she looks great , doesn &apos;t she ?
yeah .
not really gaining weight the way i would &apos;ve expected .
i finally understand why people say pregnant women glow .
phil , i have had three children .
hey , dad , gloria , open our present .
ooh ! i hope it &apos;s something fancy .
it &apos;s for the baby . i love it !
we got it in a shop at heathrow , duty free .
not for long .
isn &apos;t it absolutely brilliant ?
okay , we were in london two weeks . lose the accent , madonna .
why is your face all scratched up ?
stupid larry .
this feels so weird .
it suits you .
don &apos;t even joke about it .
that &apos;s it . he is moving out of the house tomorrow .
really ?
oh , and that beard is going .
fine , but it &apos;s gonna kill shorty .
okay , everybody , let &apos;s gather together .
manny &apos;s gonna read us a little something
that he prepare in his poetry camp .
thank you , mom .
this is for my new baby brother or sister .
&quot; welcome , little one .
open your eyes and take your place .
this is where you &apos;re meant to be ,
nestled in the bosom of your mother . &quot;
lucky baby .
what ?
love you , baby .
&quot; this is where you &apos;re meant to be ,
in the arms of your father .
his long , long journey has readied him for this day ,
though his skin may be loose ,
his hair but a wisp ,
and his eyes milky with age , &quot;
all right , we &apos;re done here .
get a drink .
don &apos;t feel bad about making move out , mrs . d.
i knew this day would come eventually ,
and i &apos;m totally covered .
great . so we &apos;ll see you around .
i got a place with an old friend of mine .
well , not so much of a place as a storage pod .
and not so much of a ... friend as a raccoon .
good to know you &apos;ll have company .
i call him bubbles because his mouth is all foamy .
dylan , i &apos;m on to your little game .
i know non of this is ture .
you just try to guilt me into i letting you stay .
you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll just live in my car .
think i can borrow a coat hanger
in case i get lock in there again .
god .
what &apos;s going on ?
no , no no . all of it .
sure you don &apos;t wanna dance with the devil before i get rid of it .
go .
