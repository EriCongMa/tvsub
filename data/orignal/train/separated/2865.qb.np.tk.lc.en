what time is it ?
2 : 17 .
wow ! you realize that we &apos;ve been throwing this ball ,
without dropping it , for like an hour ?
are you serious ?
i realized it a half @-@ hour ago , but i didn &apos;t say anything.i didn &apos;t wanna jinx it .
we are pretty good at this .
we totally forgot about lunch .
that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever missed a meal .
i think my pants are a little loose .
hey , you guys . is monica here ?
no
i bought something . i &apos;m not sure she &apos;ll like it .
it may seem crazy ,
but i &apos;ve wanted this since i was a little girl .
you bought shaun cassidy !
no . i wish !
okay , you ready ? yes
check it out .
what is it ? what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a cat .
that is not a cat !
yes , it is !
why is it inside out ?
excuse me !
but this is a purebred , show @-@ quality sphinx cat .
how much did you pay for that ?
it was extravagant , but i got a good deal .
how much ?
thousand bucks .
on a cat ?
it &apos;s not a cat !
for a thousand dollars , you &apos;d think at least it &apos;d come with hair .
or something .
all right . listen , ball boys .
my grandma had one when i was little . it was the sweetest thing .
it would sit in my lap and just purr all day long .
i would drag a string and it would chase it .
free cats do that too , you know .
it &apos;s not a cat !
i &apos;m really excited about this , okay ? i don &apos;t care what you think .
i &apos;m gonna set up a litter box for mrs. whiskerson .
what am i gonna call her ? fluffy ?
do you wanna get something to eat ,
or see how long we can throw this ball ?
the ball thing .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could go for two hours without dropping it ?
yeah , it would !
let &apos;s do it .
what ?
i have to pee.and rachel &apos;s in the bathroom !
man , i didn &apos;t think we &apos;d make it .
i know .
don &apos;t switch hands , okay ?
hey , ladies . what are you in here for ?
what are you doing here ?
i am here to report a crime .
it &apos;s a crime that we don &apos;t spend time together .
what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re thinking about moving in with phoebe ,
and i thought we should talk.you know , man to ... well , me .
sure , okay .
are you crazy ?
are you insane ? if you live with phoebe , you two are gonna be living together .
i considered that . it &apos;d make me happy .
you mean scared .
no , i mean happy .
scared happy .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to open your eyes ! don &apos;t you see
if you live with phoebe , she is always gonna be there .
you get home , she &apos;s there . you go to bed , she &apos;s there .
you wake up and , oh , yes , she &apos;s there .
i know . i can &apos;t wait !
were your parents happy or something ?
i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love .
i just want to be around her as much as i can .
when you say it , it doesn &apos;t sound so scary .
you know what i &apos;m saying ? yeah , i think i do .
you know what ? move in with her .
move in right now .
maybe i &apos;ll move in with monica .
no , it &apos;s too soon for you guys .
you &apos;re right about that .
when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon ...
... they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws .
how did it get there ?
maybe this should be more of a quiet game .
hey , guys .
i left my watch here last night .
lt was here . where is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on , i &apos;m late for work .
how do you know ? you don &apos;t have a watch .
can you stop throwing the ball for one minute and help me find it ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .... yeah , can &apos;t do it .
what ?
monica , whatever you do , do not drop that ball .
we haven &apos;t dropped it in ....
two hours , 27 minutes .
really ?
i won &apos;t make it in to work today.i don &apos;t feel very good .
yes
for a second , i thought i was feeling better , but i &apos;m not .
hey , rach .
check it out . almost three hours without dropping it .
congratulations . that &apos;s quite a waste of time .
rach ? yeah ?
you have scratches all over you.what happened ?
well , it &apos;s my cat . what ?
oh , i got a cat .
i don &apos;t want a cat !
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s not a cat . yeah
you guys , this cat is nothing like my grandmother &apos;s cat .
it &apos;s not sweet . it &apos;s not cute .
i dragged a string ,
and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me .
i know this sounds crazy ,
but every time this cat hisses at me i know it &apos;s saying , &quot; rachel ! &quot;
doesn &apos;t sound as crazy as paying $ 1000 for a cat .
you paid $ 1000 for a cat when you owe me $ 300 ?
well , i was gonna let you play with it .
hi
did you talk to gary about moving in ?
i think you should do it .
what ?
he &apos;s a great guy and he loves you a lot . you are a very lucky lady .
you are useless !
freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do ...
... and you can &apos;t even do that right !
sorry .
if he asked me , i &apos;d move in with him .
god !
get out of here , good @-@ for @-@ nothing .
hey , chandler.hey , gar .
hey , sweetie .
can i talk to you for a second ?
you look pretty today .
thanks . okay .
here &apos;s the thing .
i really want this relationship to move forward .
if you &apos;re not moving forward , you &apos;re moving backwards .
no , if you &apos;re not moving forward , you &apos;re staying still .
and staying still is good . watch this .
phoebe ? yes
i want you to move in with me .
that is so sweet .
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s too soon ?
there &apos;s so much we don &apos;t know about each other .
okay . i get it .
i don &apos;t want us to jump into something that we &apos;re not ready for .
i don &apos;t want to mess up what we have .
i &apos;m worried it &apos;s gonna be a big mistake .
ya
which is why my answer is yes !
really ?
you &apos;re so happy .
monica , stop throwing it so hard !
we &apos;re on the same team !
you guys have been doing this for four hours ?
that &apos;s right , baby .
all right . let me in .
no , no ! don &apos;t do it !
what ?
he &apos;s a dropper .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s right !
i &apos;m not a dropper !
it &apos;s really a three @-@ person game , you know ?
it &apos;s throwing and catching .
all right .
oh , it &apos;s so hard .
don &apos;t worry , guys . it &apos;s not a cat .
oh , good god !
i give up . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with this thing .
baking it didn &apos;t help ?
take it back to where you got it .
i tried . they won &apos;t take her back .
maybe that &apos;s because she &apos;s a minion of the antichrist .
why won &apos;t they take it ?
they said they would only give me store credit .
what am i gonna do ? get 1000 regular cats ?
you said it was a show cat . why don &apos;t you show it , win some prize money .
those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter , ...
and all you win are these ribbons which technically belong to the damn cat .
you can keep it until you find out what to do with it .
that &apos;s not the point .
i &apos;m out $ 1000 ... i &apos;m all scratched up
... and i &apos;m stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand !
oh , my god ! the cat &apos;s made my eyes water .
don &apos;t throw it to me !
my vision &apos;s been compromised !
oh , god ! okay .
it &apos;s okay . man , that was close .
yeah , you almost overreacted to something .
we have great news .
we &apos;re moving in together . yay !
congratulations.-i &apos;m so excited !
so am l .
you &apos;re not more excited than i am . no way . i &apos;m the most excited .
see you at the station later .
i &apos;ll see you later . don &apos;t forget about the moving @-@ in !
so you &apos;re moving in with him ?
i couldn &apos;t tell him no . he got so sad .
maybe it &apos;ll be all right .
i do like him a lot ... and probably do it eventually , anyway .
plus , think of all the money i &apos;ll save on stamps .
do you write him a lot ?
i heard when people live together ... they split the cost of stamps , don &apos;t they ?
yeah , yeah . -that &apos;s right .
sorry , the oven mitts really freaked me out .
hey , honey .

so i won &apos;t try and take you on .
so $ 800 , and i don &apos;t call the cops , because you are robbing me blind !
