my name is elena gilbert .
i &apos;m a new vampire , and there have been complications .
i know that i &apos;m sired to you , damon .
you know what would make me happy ?
that what you actually felt for me was real .
but there &apos;s hope now . there &apos;s a cure .
and we &apos;re as close to finding it as we &apos;ve ever been .
here we go .
we &apos;ve traveled far from home ,
where the cure is buried with an ancient evil .
what do you know about silas ?
he &apos;s the world &apos;s first immortal being ,
and i want to free him .
if silas rises , he &apos;ll unleash hell on earth .
the search has been dangerous .
jeremy .
loyalties have been tested .
i don &apos;t care about some lame @-@ ass cure for vampires .
how can you say that right now ?
because i don &apos;t want you to be cured .
i can keep expression from consuming you .
downside is , you turned her into a bomb that only you can dismantle .
now bonnie has to keep me alive .
what the hell is going on ?
the gang &apos;s all here . silas awaits .
the cure is within our reach ,
but we &apos;re not the only ones looking for it .
you &apos;re one of the five .
something bothering you ?
would you believe me if i said mosquitoes ?
oh , aye , i would .
how does it feel when a relentless eating machine
is draining the blood from your veins ?
itchy .
your friends from mystic falls think you &apos;re funny , damon ?
you obviously know who i am and where i &apos;m from .
have you been spying on me ?
aye .
i have .
you and stefan ,
elena ,
your witch , bonnie .
you need her to cast the spell written
on your pal jeremy &apos;s hunter &apos;s mark ...
a tattoo that looks exactly like this ?
you want to know something , just ask .
i &apos;ve been killing vampires my entire life .
still , this thing refused to reveal itself to me .
that was , until 3 days ago ,
and it just magically completed for no apparent reason .
come on , man . do i look like i know anything about tattoos ?
look at my skin .
it &apos;s flawless .
ah , you &apos;re not taking me seriously .
i don &apos;t blame you .
you don &apos;t know me .
so let me introduce myself .
my name is galen vaughn ,
and you &apos;d better start talking .
tell me you &apos;re not serious .
i wish i weren &apos;t .
when we got back from looking for jeremy ,
shane and bonnie were both gone , too .
shane needs bonnie to cast a spell on jeremy &apos;s tattoo
in order to find the cure ,
and he managed to sneak them both out from under our noses .
well , where &apos;s damon in all this ?
we had an argument .
i thought he was just taking a walk ,
but then when we went to the beach , we saw signs of a struggle .
meaning what ?
meaning somebody probably jumped him and then grabbed him .
do you think shane took him ?
no , i mean , he &apos;s not strong enough to take damon on ,
even with the element of surprise .
he must have someone or at least a few someones helping him .
i am so sorry . i wish i was there to help .
well , maybe there &apos;s something you can do from home .
anything . tell me .
so shane &apos;s looking for the cure . we think we can find him .
we have pictures of jeremy &apos;s tattoo ,
but we just can &apos;t translate the map .
unless you get the hunter &apos;s sword from klaus .
exactly .
he &apos;ll never give up the sword .
yeah , but if anyone &apos;s gonna get him to give it up , it &apos;s caroline .
he will never give up the sword ,
not even for caroline .
he &apos;s terrified we &apos;ll use the cure against him to make him mortal ,
and even if he wasn &apos;t ,
he wouldn &apos;t want any of us
to derive a moment &apos;s worth of happiness from being human .
well , maybe he doesn &apos;t have to give it up .
klaus is stuck in elena &apos;s house by bonnie &apos;s spell .
he can &apos;t go anywhere .
there &apos;s only so many places you can hide a 3 @-@ foot piece of metal .
i &apos;ll find it . don &apos;t worry .
just email me photos of jeremy &apos;s tattoo .
i &apos;ll find the sword and i &apos;ll call you back .
thank you , caroline .
bye .
need my help with anything , love ?
nope .
this is as far as i go .
we &apos;re on the brink of a monumental event in human history .
we &apos;re gonna raise the most powerful immortal creature that ever was .
come on , our work &apos;s not done yet .
mine is . you said get the kid and the witch .
i did . i want to get paid now .
i &apos;ll say a prayer for your souls .
that &apos;s what the tombstone was for ?
to pay off a mercenary ?
the core of that tombstone is made up of qetsiyah &apos;s calcified blood .
in some witch circles ,
that stone &apos;s more valuable than the hope diamond .
so ...
so who wants to go down first ?
well , if it isn &apos;t little orphan lockwood .
come to show how laughably impotent you are against me ?
i &apos;m just trying to help my friends find the cure .
found this in your attic .
and you think finding the sword
brings you closer to the cure ?
you tell me .
i was playing around with the handle on the ride over ...
and i found this .
and what do you think this is ?
it &apos;s called the cryptex . i &apos;ve seen &quot; the da vinci code . &quot;
you turn the different sides to the different symbols
to get the translation on the other side .
and , with the magic of the internet ,
elena sent over these .
so now all we have to do is cryptex away .
if you happened to want to help , we wouldn &apos;t stop you .
right . well , might i suggest using the magic of the internet
to purchase an aramaic @-@ to @-@ english dictionary
from your nearest retailer ?
what &apos;s aramaic ?
it &apos;s a dead language .
it hasn &apos;t been used since , like , biblical times .
qetsiyah &apos;s native tongue , i &apos;m guessing .
you know , even if you had the best dictionary in the world ,
it could take days to translate ...
perhaps weeks .
&quot; in bas so @-@ teen @-@ too ara @-@ ma @-@ eet . &quot;
what does that mean ?
&quot; if only you spoke aramaic . &quot;
and , once again ,
everyone &apos;s life is in danger looking for this cure
because poor elena can &apos;t deal with being a vampire .
no , everyone &apos;s here because they want to be .
not just for you , but for themselves , too .
stefan ,
why didn &apos;t you tell me that you wanted the cure for yourself ?
i mean , why wouldn &apos;t i want to take it ?
i &apos;ve seen every side of vampirism there is .
the power ... the misery , the guilt .
in the long run , even the good parts kind of suck , too .
yeah , i mean , i know why you would want to take it , but ...
all i &apos;m saying is ... why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
&apos;cause it had nothing to do with you .
i mean , you know how much i wanted a human life with you ,
being human myself ,
being normal--
that &apos;s something i &apos;ve wanted since long before i met you .
well , i &apos;m glad you told me now .
yeah , what &apos;s a deeply buried personal secret between friends , right ?
between friends ? i like that .
mind telling me where we &apos;re going ?
at the wishing well lies an entrance to a crypt .
in the crypt lies silas .
and with silas lies the cure ,
which will allow me to kill silas ,
bring the mission of the brotherhood of the 5 to an end .
you &apos;re my leverage , damon ;
i use you to get your witch friend
to open the passage to silas &apos; crypt for me .
wait a minute . you &apos;re using me to get to bonnie bennett ?
whoa , brother . heh !
you picked the wrong vampire .
i guess we &apos;ll see about that .
here &apos;s the deal , shrek .
my witch friend will open the passage for you .
no leverage necessary .
we don &apos;t care about silas .
all we want is the cure , so you cut us in on your share ,
we &apos;ll get out of your hair .
you really don &apos;t understand , do you ?
ok , this is it .
we &apos;ve translated all the symbols on the tattoo .
&quot; passage inside ...
requires a young senator and a pretty flower . &quot;
ok , none of this makes sense .
no , i don &apos;t understand , so why don &apos;t you explain it ?
silas is immortal .
i have to cram the cure down his throat in order to kill him .
yeah , what does it have to do with me and my friends ?
&quot; requires a powerful witch and a hunter in full bloom . &quot;
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t need to tell you my reasons .
caroline .
bring my sword over here .
i need to use the cure against silas .
your friends , they can &apos;t exactly have it , now , can they ?
so you use it on silas ,
and we &apos;ll use it for whoever wants to use it .
&quot; silas rests on the far side ,
the means of his destruction at hand . &quot;
turn the cryptex to the right .
stop .
the top of the hilt reveals a key to a nautical map .
turn it to the left .
now turn the other piece .
there &apos;s something else .
you don &apos;t want to share it with us ?
even if i wanted to , i couldn &apos;t .
and why can &apos;t you share it ?
so it is written .
what does it mean ?
klaus , what does it mean ?
there is only one dose .
you ok ?
yeah , i just slipped .
ok , come here .
it &apos;s ok .
thanks .
hey , guys , i &apos;m coming down .
hey , bon .
what do you think &apos;s gonna happen
once you cast a spell on my tattoo
and there &apos;s nothing in between shane and silas ?
do you trust me ?
yeah , of course .
then trust me when i promise i won &apos;t let shane raise silas .
just don &apos;t do anything stupid .
if your expression gets out of hand ,
shane is the only one that could help you keep it in control .
don &apos;t worry about me . i &apos;m fine .
but if shane tries to lift a finger on his hand
to hurt either one of us ...
i &apos;ll kill him myself .
hello ? hey , it &apos;s caroline .
we have the translation of the tattoo .
we &apos;re emailing you pictures of the map and instructions right now .
got it . thanks .
actually , it was me .
nik , you helped ?
you sound so surprised , little sister .
shouldn &apos;t i be ? i mean , you don &apos;t want me to be human .
you don &apos;t want any of us to be human .
why would you help us find the cure ?
maybe i finally realized the
longer i stand in the way of what you want ,
the longer you &apos;ll continue to hate me .
perhaps i want my sister to finally know happiness .
fool me once , shame on you ; fool me a hundred times--
no more fooling . no more games .
i hope you get to live ,
and die , as you wish .
so do i.
there is one more thing , rebekah .
there is only one dose of the cure .
you need to find it fast and take it .
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll--
nik . nik !
you touch me again--
and you &apos;ll what ? threaten me ?
sorry if you &apos;re upset about the cure , damon ,
but we &apos;ve got road to cover .
i don &apos;t care about the cure .
in fact , i don &apos;t know why anyone wouldn &apos;t want to be a vampire .
you know what ? if i wasn &apos;t a vampire ,
then i wouldn &apos;t be able to do 9 of the things
i &apos;m gonna do to you when i &apos;m free .
make that 10 .
right .
all right , i admit , ok ?
my friends want the cure ,
and i want them to have it ,
and i get very upset when i can &apos;t provide for my loved ones .
but tell me something , vaughn ,
if all you &apos;re worried about is bonnie the teenage witch ,
then why &apos;d you save jeremy and elena yesterday ?
how did i do that ?
big guy .
white paint all over him .
stuck a hatchet in his spine .
i don &apos;t remember doing such a thing .
we &apos;re on a remote island .
there &apos;s you , me , and a bunch of unpleasant locals .
you expect me to believe that someone else
took out that monster truck of a human being
that went after jeremy and elena ?
i &apos;m telling you , it wasn &apos;t me .
was that you ?
no . you ?
no .
i reckon there really is someone else on this island .
it &apos;s just amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
once we raise silas ,
all of our sacrifices will have been worthwhile ;
we &apos;ll all have what we want .
or he &apos;ll kill us all .
listen , you &apos;re gonna see i &apos;m right .
just so you don &apos;t get any ideas , remember ,
anything happens to me , something a lot worse will happen to you .
all right . where &apos;s this stupid magic passage she needs to open ?
just look for anything that looks out of place ,
all right ? anything not occurring in nature ,
like a drawing or an inscription or ...
geometrically perfect circle .
this is it .
this is the spot .
what did caroline say ?
i don &apos;t know . we lost the signal .
come on . this way .
we need to get down and across .
advantage , vampires :
all we have to do is jump .
wait , wait . um ...
maybe you should leave the map behind .
in case you fall , you don &apos;t want anything to happen to the phone .
are we doing this again ?
i thought we were a team .
guys , we don &apos;t have time for this .
elena , you go first .
we &apos;ll be right behind you .
there &apos;s something you should know about the cure .
now you &apos;re doing it . just breathe ,
all right ? focus on what you can do .
don &apos;t be afraid of what you can &apos;t .
you can do this .
remember , just like you taught me .
you &apos;re in control .
that &apos;s it . it &apos;s just like drawing breath .
now just pull the power into you .
looks like your witch is casting her spell .
so you &apos;re sure that klaus is telling the truth ,
that there is only one dose of the cure ?
well , i guess that &apos;s what happens
when you &apos;re dumb enough to hold out hope .
there &apos;s still hope for one of us ,
but even if i felt pity for you ,
if i wanted to ease your pain
so i gave you the cure to take for yourself ,
you &apos;d give it to elena , wouldn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
well , i &apos;m sorry that
it couldn &apos;t work out the way we all wanted it to .
bonnie !
bonnie !
i &apos;m fine .
here .
look .
it worked .
you did it .
we did it .
hey , guys .
i need a hand . my leg &apos;s broken .
best to stay off it , then .
bonnie .
wait , wait . don &apos;t--
come on . bonnie !
help me ! come on ! please !
help me !
well , here we are .
looks like someone beat us to the punch .
that &apos;s a shame , damon .
you have no use anymore .
hate to kill ya .
ditto . you know , that pesky hunter &apos;s curse and all .
all right .
how do you want to do this ?
i &apos;ll make it quick and painless .
wish i could make the same promise .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
and then i &apos;m gonna get to that damn cure ,
and i &apos;m gonna give it to the girl that i love .
your attachment to your friends will be the end of you .
you don &apos;t know my friends ...
or my enemies .
there &apos;s only one cure ?
i can &apos;t take it . i mean ,
not above everyone else who deserves it just as much as i do .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be . maybe it &apos;s a blessing in disguise .
how so ?
things changed the minute that i went off that bridge , stefan .
even if i could be human again ,
i wouldn &apos;t be the person that i was .
so it &apos;s about time that i accept the person that i am now
and figure out a way ... to start living the rest of my life .
the rest of your life ...
sired to damon .
i guess we &apos;ll have to deal with that when i get home .
my god ...
home . klaus .
bonnie &apos;s spell isn &apos;t gonna hold him .
and after what we did to kol ,
if we don &apos;t ram that cure down his throat ,
he &apos;ll kill us all .
pity party over . we have to go .
every time i think i have him ,
that son of a bitch gets the upper hand .
we won &apos;t let him hurt you .
stefan and elena will bring back the cure .
if they get to it first .
and if they don &apos;t , klaus kills me .
i need to get out of town
to figure out how i &apos;m gonna stay alive--
wait , hang on , ok ? gosh !
before you get all doomsday , just--
at least let me try and talk to him .
he &apos;s got nothing to lose , care .
his brother &apos;s dead , his hybrids are gone .
all he wants right now is blood , starting with mine .
i &apos;m not gonna say good @-@ bye to you again , do you understand me ?
let me fix this .
are we gonna dance or are we gonna play ?
you know he can &apos;t hurt me , damon ,
unless he &apos;s got the white oak stake .
he doesn &apos;t , but he &apos;s got other toys .
damon !
you &apos;re wasting time . just get the cure . go .
we &apos;re not gonna leave you .
no , we aren &apos;t .
you need to go ahead . we &apos;ll be right behind you .
go .
look at us .
a newbie hunter and a witch who needs adult supervision .
how are we the ones that made it this far ?
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re here together .
me , too .
where is &quot; here , &quot; exactly ?
this way .
how do you know ?
i just know .
hello , bonnie .
hi , grams .
what are you doing here , grams ?
this place allows the living to talk to the dead .
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
i am so sorry
about what happened .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re here now .
and you are this close to bringing me back to life for good .
how ?
silas can do it .
all you have to do is reach him and feed him ,
and everything will go back to the way it was .
bonnie , stop !
hey , you &apos;re not seeing your grams .
if she were here , i &apos;d be able to see her , and i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not her ghost . it &apos;s a hallucination .
what you &apos;re seeing , it isn &apos;t real .
it &apos;s me . your grams isn &apos;t here .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m real , okay ?
what happened ?
silas . he was in your head .
he was trying to control you .
and shane . illusions of his wife .
that &apos;s how silas controls him .
you need to block him out of your mind .
close your eyes .
listen to my voice and only my voice .
i &apos;m gonna get us there .
you can &apos;t kill tyler .
not only can i , i have to .
i have a reputation to uphold .
moreover , i want to .
i &apos;m not asking you to forgive him .
all i &apos;m asking is that you let him live ,
somewhere far from here .
so he gets to live a happy life
after he turned all my hybrids against me ,
after he tried to kill me ,
after he made it his life &apos;s mission
to find the cure so he could use it against me .
we all want the cure .
do we ?
do you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . there &apos;s only one ,
so it &apos;s not like i &apos;m gonna get it anyway .
but if you could ...
you wouldn &apos;t , would you ?
you prefer who you are now to the girl you once were .
you like being strong ,
ageless , fearless .
we &apos;re the same , caroline .
then show me .
you know how much i love tyler .
you can see how scared i am to lose him .
if you and i are so similar ,
then show me your compassion .
show him the mercy that i would show you .
mercy ... for tyler ?
very well .
tell him to leave town immediately .
and tell him to run and hide in a place i will never find him .
of course .
tell him that this is the mercy i extend for your sake ...
that i will give him a head start before i kill him .
all right , come on . we have to catch up .
no , it &apos;s ok . i just need a minute .
i &apos;m only gonna slow you down . go .
she only needs one of us .
and what ? you don &apos;t care to be that one anymore ?
you finally decided it was easier to just walk away ?
there &apos;s only one dose of the cure , stefan .
she wants to take it , you want her too .
i don &apos;t . just do what makes her happy , stefan .
things have changed . it &apos;s not that easy anymore .
it is right now .
get your ass down the well , help elena get the damn thing .
come on .
stefan ?
hello ?
elena .
no .
how many times are we gonna have to say good @-@ bye ?
at least this time we have a minute to do it the right way .
there isn &apos;t a right way .
this isn &apos;t good @-@ bye .
this is ... until we find a way .
we &apos;re immortal , remember ?
we will find a way .
what if we don &apos;t ?
tell me that you &apos;ll never think of me again .
tell me that you &apos;ll forget about me ,
tell me that you are gonna go on
and live a full and happy life without me .
i will live a happy life without you .
i will forget all about you .
and i will never , ever ...
think about you again .
until we find a way .
hey , i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d want to share a little of that vampire blood .
where are jeremy and bonnie ?
i have no idea .
stop lying !
i &apos;m not lying ...
but if you help me ,
i will take you the rest of the way , i promise .
did you know this whole time that there was only one cure ?
what ? no .
how could i ? i &apos;ve never seen it .
look , everything i ever said
and did was just to bring back my family , i swear .
well , then you know what it &apos;s like to have hope ,
and now you know what it feels like to lose it .
come on . come on !
caitlin .
i &apos;m sorry , caitlin .
i failed you .
no .
you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
i tried .
you did everything i asked you to .
everything is going to be just fine .
is this it ?
this is the cure ?
how is that supposed to cure every vampire in the world ?
i don &apos;t think it is , jer .
it &apos;s stuck . help me move it .
it &apos;s , like , fossilized in place .
it &apos;s like trying to bend stone .
oh , my god .
what ?
what , bonnie ?
he &apos;s been frozen like a vampire statue for 2,000 years .
there &apos;s only one way we &apos;re gonna get this statue to unfreeze .
how &apos;s that ?
we have to feed him our blood .
if we want to get the cure out of his hands , we ...
we have to wake him up .
you &apos;re alive .
yeah .
why didn &apos;t you go with them ?
needed a siesta .
you gave up , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t give up .
i just realized ...
you can &apos;t control everything ...
no matter how hard you try .
let &apos;s just say i made peace with that fact .
peace ?
you love elena .
you always will .
if she becomes human , she may not feel the same way about you .
you &apos;ll never know peace .
life sucks .
get a helmet .
you did something selfless , damon .
if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i &apos;d say you were becoming a halfway decent person .
ah , come on !
there &apos;s got to be a way to do this without raising him .
we &apos;ll find a way--
don &apos;t listen to the witch , boy .
we have to raise silas ,
and we have to do it now .
bonnie !
what are you doing ?
what you should have done already .
i &apos;m gonna raise silas ...
then i &apos;m gonna kill him .
you &apos;re a bit confused , mr. gilbert .
we &apos;re on the same team here .
you stabbed my friend !
i don &apos;t mess around with witches .
you can &apos;t use the cure on silas .
it &apos;s what it &apos;s meant for !
what else would you use it for ?
your friends ...
your sister ...
sorry , lad .
it wasn &apos;t meant for that .
nothing personal .
don &apos;t ! the hunter &apos;s curse !
you ok ?
how did you get out ?
i fear something awful has befallen your friend bonnie .
don &apos;t worry , love .
you know i &apos;d never hurt you .
you &apos;ve done enough .
i &apos;ve done more than enough .
i &apos;ve shown kindness ,
forgiveness ,
pity ...
because of you , caroline .
it was all for you .
elena .
what happened ?
she &apos;s here !
who ?
elena &apos;s here now , ok ? everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
we did it .
come on . we got to get you up .
you have to help bonnie .
the hunter stabbed her . you have to feed her .
ok . i just need to make sure that you &apos;re ok first .
i &apos;m fine . what are you doing ?
the cure .
jeremy , after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
it &apos;s right there .
it &apos;ll be there after we help bonnie .
god , i forgot what a brat you were .
what ?
i &apos;m done playing nice .
katherine .
it &apos;s been too long , little gilbert .
sorry . family reunion is gonna have to be cut short .
