and as we make our way out of the gourmet kitchen ,
we find ourselves way back in the warm embrace of the parlor .
easy , dutches .
it &apos;s just one room , not gosford park .
where &apos;d you get all this sweet furniture ?
we rented it to make the house feel more comfortable and inviting .
don &apos;t sit there ! oh , my gosh .
it took me 20 minutes to get these chops just right .
there . does that look straight ?
nothing about that looks straight .
i love the house . it &apos;s beautiful .
here is a tree .
it &apos;s a pachira ,
a taiwanese symbol of good financial fortune .
so it &apos;s also known as a money tree .
that makes two of us .
well , i would like to propose a toast .
missed me .
to the hard work of claire and cameron--
or as i like to call them , &quot; clameron , &quot;
which is what potential home buyers will be doing
when they see this place .
clamoring .
clamoring t @-@ to buy it f--
phil , don &apos;t go back for it .
because this house is going to sell .
who &apos;s the best realtor in town ?
gil thorpe .
that &apos;s right ,
and he has buyers coming over tomorrow .
that &apos;s right .
all right .
to claire and cam .
my sister . my partner .
my sister ! my partner ! my sister ! my partner !
&quot; chinatown . &quot; hilarious .
still empty .
okay , you know you &apos;re my ride .
to clameron !
hear , hear .
speech !
oh ! well , gosh , i wasn &apos;t prepared for this .
i ... i think we should just really thank the people--
here &apos;s to the best construction crew in the business .
okay . okay .
hank . luis . paco !
wish you could be here right now , buddy .
what ? did he die ?
no , he &apos;s on the roof fixing the shingle
that he should &apos;ve gotten right the first time .
i guess the most important people-
and then to my partner .
yes .
my lifelong companion .
my lovah .
okay , cam .
who had his doubts about this project the whole time ,
and never , even in my darkest moment ,
said &quot; i told you so . &quot;
which is good because he would &apos;ve been wrong .
very gracious .
and i &apos;m sure that the house is gonna sell in no time .
great . hear , hear !
hey , i &apos;ve got a friend who wants to buy a house .
maybe i can show it to him after school .
then if he buys it , i &apos;d get the commission .
what would that be ?
adorable .
i &apos;m serious . and i &apos;m not adorable .
i &apos;m getting a mustache .
i know my a @-@ b @-@ c &apos;s .
i guess things weren &apos;t about you for a second .
okay , wrapping this up .
to the fastest sale in real estate history .
yes ! bravo !
seriously , it &apos;s bad luck to toast with an empty glass .
dunphy , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you .
you guys did a nice job on the house . my buyer wants in .
fantastic ! that is great news !
you know , when we first got into this--
the small talk &apos;s over .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re prepared to offer .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
i don &apos;t joke about real estate .
i joke about golf and mexicans .
it &apos;s okay , though . i &apos;m married to one .
w @-@ we &apos;re not gonna take this .
it &apos;s the first day on the market .
we &apos;d barely break even .
take it .
no .
the market &apos;s crashing !
nuh @-@ unh .
you &apos;re in over your head .
maybe you &apos;re in over your head .
dunphy , listen to me .
if you pass up on this , you &apos;re gonna regret it .
i don &apos;t know the meaning of the word &quot; regret . &quot;
here we go . french toast , double bacon .
egg whites , dry toast .
damn it .
let me tell you something , gil .
you may be top dog ,
but you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna have regrets ,
&apos;cause this house is gonna sell like ... that .
that &apos;s it for today .
we &apos;re going to die in this house .
oh , the pillows have lost their fluff .
the pillows are not the problem !
it &apos;s okay , manny . i &apos;ll see you in a minute .
yes , i &apos;ll be polite and i &apos;ll be nice . i promise .
i &apos;m going to kill him .
what &apos;d javier do this time ?
his one big weekend alone with his son ,
and i just found out
that he brought his latest bimbo along .
he always does this .
you remember that time that he took manny
and that stripper fishing ?
yeah . they barely got a nipple .
come on . that was good . i just thought of that .
are you done ?
i bet she was comfortable with the pole .
ah . should &apos;ve quit after &quot; nipple . &quot;
how does leno do it night after night ?
i was just wondering that about myself .
phil , please . tell us that you have some good news .
well , it &apos;s complicated because i don &apos;t have good news ,
but i really want you guys to like me .
what ?
gil thorpe called back with another offer ,
but it was $ 10,000 lower than the last one .
lower ?
oh , that is perfect . that &apos;s just perfect .
something you wanna say , mitchell ?
yes . i told you so .
i warned you this would happen .
i tried to stop it , but you wouldn &apos;t let me .
i was right , and you were wrong .
you live in this ridiculous candy @-@ colored fantasy land .
i am so much smarter than you ,
and it is killing me not to rub your nose in it !
no . i &apos;m just thinking .
okay , guys , we have to do something .
we can &apos;t carry this house for much longer .
cam , what did you spend on staging ?
uh , let &apos;s see . i don &apos;t know .
how can you not know ? !
because i was hungry , and everything was so pretty .
and i didn &apos;t think it would matter
because who could &apos;ve guessed
we wouldn &apos;t have sold the house by now ?
me .
phil , do you think you can
get gil thorpe up to his original offer ?
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
you could , uh , flatter him , stroke his ego .
no , he &apos;d never fall for that . he &apos;s too smart .
but , honey , if anybody can pull it off , you can .
you &apos;re so good at everything .
that is true .
i &apos;ll do it .
we &apos;re back !
i cannot believe that again you brought a girl .
what is it this time ?
a cocktail waitress ?
a boat show model ? a stripper ?
no , then i could make real money .
i &apos;m just a phd .
mom , this is trish .
gloria , hi .
hi .
jay .
how do you do ?
i have heard so much about you .
she works at the museum of art .
it was so cool . we got an after hours tour ,
and trish said i could take flash pictures of the paintings .
but don &apos;t worry . i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s a relief .
i was afraid i was gonna have to look at &apos; em .
so you work at the museum ?
oh , no . i &apos;m just on the board .
i run the art and antiquities department at christie &apos;s .
let me see . what is the word i am looking for ?
oh , yes . bam !
so how did you two meet ?
i won a car in a poker game , but it caught on fire ,
so the guy gave me a painting .
i took it to the auction house ,
eh , ticky ticky , i made a big profit
but i still came home with a masterpiece .
he means her .
may i tell you , you have a wonderful boy ?
so well @-@ mannered and chivalrous .
it &apos;s like he leapt off the canvas
of a 16th century portrait by gainsborough or van dyke .
listen to that brain .
can they stay for dinner ?
well , that &apos;s up to them , papi .
how can i turn down a free meal ?
first time &apos;s the hardest .
what do you say , my love ?
well , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready to say good @-@ bye to this guy yet .
but i &apos;ll only stay if you let me contribute .
i did bring along a fabulous bottle of &apos; 82 bordeaux
that we didn &apos;t get to this weekend .
for that , you can take manny home .
see what i have to put up with ?
gil !
phil dunphy .
i knew you &apos;d come slinking back !
hey , guys !
it &apos;s dunphy . he &apos;s cavin &apos; . what did i tell you ?
what did i tell you , hey ?
oh , dunphy , i can play you like a ukulele ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re small and dainty .
gil , i wanna talk to you about your offer .
let me stop you right there .
this is how this is gonna go down .
first of all , i &apos;m gonna take you out to a very nice dinner .
i &apos;m gonna talk really sweet to you .
and then i &apos;m gonna lay you down by the fire ...
oh . slow at first , then ...
if you guys are talking about the house ,
my friend zack &apos;s still looking .
honey , 14 @-@ year @-@ olds can &apos;t afford to buy houses .
he &apos;s not 14 .
he &apos;s a software guy who volunteers at my school .
we &apos;re gonna be sweating ...
he &apos;s an adult with money ?
he drives a nicer car than you .
get me his number right now !
and then you &apos;re gonna go home
and tell everybody you went to the movies ,
but you and i both know
that you got thorpedoed .
guess what , gil . this was a courtesy call
to tell you that i have another buyer .
so you can tell your buyer that
you cost them a great house
because you got cocky and overplayed your hand .
prepare to phil the agony of dun @-@ feat .
both names !
now i &apos;m not an art expert like you ,
but i did acquire this piece in a gallery
in one of the finer vegas casinos .
what do you think ?
it does say something .
he used to , before his little voice box broke .
it said , &quot; welcome home , master . rough day ? &quot;
again ?
would you believe she made me keep this in the attic ?
gloria , trish says this is art .
what was it thoreau said ?
&quot; it &apos;s not what you look at that matters . it &apos;s what you see . &quot;
hear that ?
you were wrong .
keep talking like that ,
and you will find out how he lost his voice box .
what have we here ?
his name &apos;s barkley .
that &apos;s delightful .
it &apos;s not delightful . it &apos;s disgusting .
uh , look at warhol . look at koons .
a lot of great works of contemporary art
were initially dismissed as garbage .
excellent point , trish .
this is not even garbage .
they wouldn &apos;t take it . it &apos;s too big for the can .
now what i see is a man who is not man .
he is a servant who has lost his dignity .
it is a commentary on the class system in society--
as well as a handy place to put your keys and sunglasses .
whatever he is ,
your barkley is going back to the attic .
i &apos;m going to see the baby .
barkley .
very clever .
come on , guys . let &apos;s play .
what are you going to play ?
charades . me and trish against dad and jay .
i have to warn you , jay . these two are very good .
it &apos;s like they have their own language .
i want to play , too .
which team should i join ?
go with manny .
go with jay .
them .
his team .
okay , then . great .
well , we &apos;ll see you tonight .
well , zack barbie is indeed an adult ,
he likes the neighborhood , and he &apos;s interested .
oh , thank god .
really ? did god come in here and tell you about him ?
because i don &apos;t remember it that way .
okay , okay , this is it , people .
we cannot afford to lose this buyer .
why am i standing ?
phil , do you think this is the right house for him ?
it &apos;s hard to tell . he &apos;s young . he &apos;s single .
i don &apos;t know anything else about him .
zack barbie . born 1986 .
went to college at a place called &quot; mit . &quot;
m.i.t.
i know how to spell it .
five words .
it &apos;s a book .
there &apos;s an old man ...
on the boat ...
he caught a big fish .
the old man and the fish !
uh , time !
&quot; the old man and the sea &quot; !
never heard about it .
hemingway &apos;s classic tale of man versus nature .
leave it to a guy with a hundred cats
to write a good fish story , right ?
oh , ho , trish !
what is this , a book club or a fun game ?
go .
play .
five words .
second word . scared . afraid .
&quot; who &apos;s afraid of virginia woolf ? &quot;
got it !
you &apos;re amazing !
wowie ! you could do this for a living .
really ? there &apos;s such a thing ?
no , just like there &apos;s no such thing
as a professional broadway enthusiast .
you &apos;re gonna have to get a real job .
okay , it &apos;s my turn .
i don &apos;t know this .
i don &apos;t know this .
mom , you have to do the one you pick .
oh , no , manny . it &apos;s fine .
just keep picking until you get one you like .
no , no . i don &apos;t have to keep picking . i &apos;m gonna do this one .
uh @-@ oh . no , i got this .
is it a play , a book , or a movie ?
yeah , one of those .
&quot; lost &quot; !
&quot; clueless &quot; !
&quot; dazed and confused &quot; !
this is stupid .
nobody can get this .
you &apos;re probably right . i just ...
yeah . see ? this is one of mine . it &apos;s really hard .
really ? what is it ? you do it .
play .
&quot; sweeney todd &quot; !
exactly .
what a team .
this is a stupid ... game !
okay , so after a quick scan of his facebook , twitter ,
tumblr , pinterest , and instagram ,
here is what i know .
privacy is dead ?
likes--chicago blackhawks , kickboxing ,
the movie &quot; die hard , &quot; and beer .
he sounds like a frat boy .
oh , he &apos;s many things .
he meditates , he loves indian food ,
and he &apos;s crazy about his dog otis .
does the house have a doggie door ?
no .
no .
put one in . you get to barbie through otis .
she &apos;s like the girl with the dragon tattoo .
with cuter hair .
stop talking !
oh , she really is .
dude has a thing for chicks in black tights ,
he likes old school funk ,
and he chipped his front tooth playing soccer .
aw ! it &apos;s actually kind of cute .
oh , my god . you &apos;re falling in love with him .
oh , please . it &apos;s just a job , nothing more .
okay , that &apos;s enough to go on . let &apos;s move .
we &apos;ve got two hours
to turn that place into zack barbie &apos;s dream house .
barbie &apos;s dream house .
we don &apos;t have time !
what the hell was all that about ?
why don &apos;t you ask trish ? she knows everything .
well , at least she &apos;s not a bimbo .
she and manny seem to hit it off fine .
what &apos;s the problem ?
just one weekend , and he already idolizes her .
and why wouldn &apos;t he ? she &apos;s so much smarter than me .
she knows so much more about the things that he loves .
they have their little inside jokes .
if she learns how to froth his cappuccino ,
i am history .
you and manny have the closest relationship i &apos;ve ever seen .
hell , he may never form
a healthy attachment with another woman after you .
you &apos;re just saying that .
and it doesn &apos;t matter if manny likes her .
knowing javier &apos;s track record ,
he &apos;ll dump her like he dumps everybody .
you are wrong , jay . i &apos;m not going to dump her .
in fact , this weekend , i asked trish to marry me .
you &apos;re going to marry her ?
i was waiting for the right time to tell you .
nailed it .
i wanted to ask you for my abuela &apos;s ring back .
i really want trish to wear it .
she is the most amazing woman i &apos;ve ever known .
you see that i am holding a knife .
please .
half our marriage was you with a knife .
trish is the one . and manny already loves her .
he can spend more time with us now--
holidays , summers even .
fine . i &apos;ll go get you the ring .
but you owe me $ 8
because i had to replace &quot; the emerald . &quot;
javier , you &apos;ve brought a lot of 30 @-@ year @-@ olds around here ,
but this one &apos;s my favorite .
and i like trish , too .
me , too .
well , then i suppose this is
as good a moment as any to tell you , manny .
trish and i are getting married .
oh , my gosh . this is the best news ever !
here . drink .
now listen , my love .
this belonged to my abuela .
um , maybe not now , javier .
no , no . please . please .
it will fill my heart to see this ring on your ...
your finger .
oh . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s a little small .
i can &apos;t do this .
no , no . i &apos;ll just push a little harder .
javier , stop . it &apos;ll never work .
but wait , my love .
we can put butter on your finger .
that &apos;s him . hit it .
hey ! not him .
hey , guys . sorry it took me so long .
i &apos;ve never bought beer before . there &apos;s just so many choices .
do we really need that much ?
i don &apos;t know . is this a lot ?
showtime !
hey ! not him .
hey ! thought i &apos;d just swing by and see how it &apos;s going .
zack here ?
oh , my god .
you are wearing black tights .
alex was right . you are into him .
that skank zoey broke his heart .
i can make him whole again !
haley .
okay , that has to be him .
everyone we know is already here .
everyone , places . let &apos;s make this perfect .
yes .
i &apos;m ira glass .
today on the program ...
no , no .
that &apos;s not it.- turn that off !
no , no , no , no , no !
turn it off !
it &apos;s the back button .
hey ! you must be zack .
i &apos;m phil dunphy . come on in .
hi .
these are my associates .
hello ! good evening .
hi !
hi !
oh , and my , uh , my daughter .
so ... this is the place .
looks nice .
so , zack , you hungry ?
uh , no . but , uh , it smells great .
yeah , it &apos;s from this amazing indian place just down the road .
it &apos;s walking distance .
which is awesome
if you &apos;ve had one too many brewskis , am i right ?
yeah .
oh . is someone a blackhawks fan ? love the hawks .
yeah , well , that &apos;s a weird coincidence .
let &apos;s go check out the kickboxing gym .
seriously ? i kickbox .
what ? !
yeah .
come on !
haley !
trish , open up !
no . i don &apos;t want to see you right now .
open up , or i &apos;m going to break down the door !
hey ! hey , hey , hey ! don &apos;t break down the door !
ay , caramba .
i &apos;m beginning to think i should &apos;ve just bought a ring .
let me talk to her .
you ?
yes . she &apos;s scared . maybe i can help .
help her go ... adios .
go ahead .
and you tell her she &apos;s being crazy and irrational .
and if she doesn &apos;t come out , i &apos;m going to burn down this house !
don &apos;t burn down the house !
trish , open ! it &apos;s gloria .
i &apos;m sorry . i needed to be alone .
in manny &apos;s bedroom ?
well ... i thought it was a bathroom .
it smells like potpourri .
listen ,
i would be the first person to understand that
you &apos;re having second thoughts about marrying javier .
i am ,
but i do love him .
of course you do ,
even though he &apos;s irresponsible and impulsive ,
and if your sisters are even a little bit pretty ,
he &apos;s gonna try--
no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not that .
is it the drinking ?
is it the gambling ?
is it because of your fat fingers ?
no , it &apos;s you .
me ?
how can i compete with you ?
all manny talks about
is how he &apos;s got the world &apos;s greatest mom .
and i know how javier regrets losing you .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
oh , believe me , he does .
and who could blame him ? i mean ...
look at you !
who has a body like that ? !
and you just had a baby two months ago ?
i mean , what--do you just live at the gym ?
who has time for the gym ?
you know what i had for lunch ? !
i had a half a granola bar ,
and i can &apos;t button my pants !
i can &apos;t cook !
and at best , i am average in bed !
and i will never ,
ever , ever live up to the great gloria !
welcome to the family !
and did i mention that from the back of the garden ,
you can almost see a piece of the building
that they shot &quot; die hard &quot; in ?
i like to sit back there sometimes .
it &apos;s a great place to gather my thoughts and just ...
i don &apos;t know . be in the now .
i meditate every day .
yippee @-@ ki @-@ yay !
what are the odds ?
you know , this is probably not gonna help
my negotiating power , but ...
i kinda can &apos;t believe how perfect this house is .
and how much is little otis gonna enjoy this doggie door ?
how do you ... know my dog &apos;s name ?
i don &apos;t .
yeah , you do . you just said &quot; otis . &quot;
no . no , no , he said ,
&quot; oh , dis doggie door would be perfect for your dog ... &quot;
should you own one .
that &apos;s not even close to what he just said .
that &apos;s what i heard .
anyway , we can do a very fast escrow
and get you in this house by the end of the month .
oh ! just in time for your birthday !
this is weird !
it &apos;s totally weird .
okay , the blackhawks , you know my birthday ,
and you know my dog &apos;s name .
you guys are freaking me out .
okay , wait a second .
we poured our hearts into this house ,
and we just wanted to show you what it would be like
if you were living here .
did we go a tiny bit overboard ?
oh , my god .
favorite song .
way to go .
you take care .
can you even see the &quot; die hard &quot; building from here ?
no .
i &apos;ll be at coachella , too ! i &apos;ll come find you !
honey !
haley !
well , that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re officially screwed .
darn it .
it &apos;s okay , honey .
no , it &apos;s not okay . i feel responsible .
i dragged us all into this .
the whole point was so that i could make a little extra money
and contribute to the family ,
and instead , i &apos;m gonna end up costing us .
i &apos;m a failure .
hey . hey .
no one could &apos;ve predicted this .
my bad .
we &apos;ll find another buyer .
this time , we &apos;ll learn from our mistakes .
got it . i got it .
he &apos;s back !
no . no , no , no ! stop ! stop . stop .
this is a great house . it was built with integrity .
we should sell it that way , okay ? no more tricks .
yeah .
let &apos;s just be honest .
no tricks .
hey , dunphy .
gil .
your office said you &apos;d be over here .
yeah , i am here .
with my buyers .
what do you guys think ?
oh , my god ! this house is perfect .
i especially love the warm embrace of the parlor !
it screams you .
no , it screams you , sweetie .
oh , dis doggie door , cam . look . ooh !
damn it . gays .
they come to play .
i &apos;m busy , gil .
don &apos;t accept any offers without talking to me first .
my buyer wants in , all right ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re pretty far down that road .
all right . we &apos;ll up the offer .
gil ...
let me tell you how this is gonna go down .
first , you &apos;re gonna buy me a lovely dinner .
no , that &apos;s not it .
first , i &apos;m gonna buy you a lovely dinner .
then i &apos;m gonna take you in the back ...
it &apos;s gonna happen ! it &apos;s gonna happen !
we &apos;re gonna sell the house .
you see , mitchell ? i told you so .
that &apos;s my wife . i better take it .
hey , hey . whoa , listen . whatever you do ,
don &apos;t tell her you &apos;re playing golf on a weekday .
you &apos;ll be doing dishes all night .
good call . thank you , my man .
hey , honey . what &apos;s up ?
oh , not much .
just , uh , in a meeting .
you know , working hard , bringing home the bacon .
no , he &apos;s not ! he &apos;s playing golf !
no .
um ... fore ! nice putt !
why you lying to your wife , dunphy ?
hey , he had a beer at lunch , too !
what is wrong with you ?
you just got thorpedoed !
