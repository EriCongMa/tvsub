as surgeons ,
we &apos;re trained to consult with each other ...
to get opposing views .
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema .
aortic pulmonary dissection .
yes ! no .
wait , no . that &apos;s not right .
well , what i &apos;m-- what i &apos;m saying is
i finally understand the complexities
of postobstructive pulmonary edema .
uh @-@ huh .
we even encourage patients to seek second opinions .
because i &apos;ve been up since 4 : 00 a.m. ,
studying for the boards with callie .
since 4 : 00 a.m.
i haven &apos;t seen my husband or my baby since yesterday .
i don &apos;t even care ,
because callie blew my mind .
she blew my mind .
my hair is on fire .
i mean , literal flames shooting out of my head .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah . that &apos;s really--
whatever . you know what ? i &apos;m gonna catch up with you later .
i mean , she &apos;s that good .
i am gonna kill the boards .
i am gonna make the boards my bitch .
yeah , boards , bitch , got it .
because i--
what are we doing ?
nothing .
but why seek a second opinion
when you know that you &apos;re right ?
you look weird . why do you look so weird ?
i do not look weird . you were ...
talking about ...
uh , the boards .
i was talking about what a good teacher callie is ,
and you weren &apos;t listening .
no , i @-@ i was listening .
what did i say ?
&apos;cause if we &apos;re honest with ourselves ...
cristina ?
surgeons are more like cowboys .
your hair is fire , callie is that good ,
the boards are your bitch .
i @-@ i gotta go .
we &apos;re more likely to go it alone .
the boards are my bitch .
hey . guess what .
i &apos;m on peds today . babies . yay .
the nicu , not the nursery .
it can get pretty intense .
oh , well , nothing is as intense
as working on derek &apos;s lost causes .
it &apos;s like a death march up there .
i mean , i call time of death on a daily basis .
what do we got today ?
well , you ever seen a baby
that weighs less than a pound ?
uh , no , because babies that weigh less than 16 ounces ...
don &apos;t survive .
my god .
he &apos;s the size of a soda can .
14 ounces .
but he &apos;s growing .
that might just be bloating from the fluids .
well , let &apos;s take a look .
how you feeling , morgan ?
i--i &apos;m the least of my worries .
you must be chris .
cardio resident at cleveland , right ?
you talk about me ?
you don &apos;t talk about me ?
oh , you guys haven &apos;t had any time
to pick out a name yet , huh ?
no , we , uh ...
yeah , we--we should do that .
any thoughts ?
we probably should wait a few weeks , don &apos;t you think ,
until he can see and hear and breathe on his own ?
14.3 ounces today .
i told you he was bigger .
let &apos;s see how that changes his outcome predictor .
outcome predictor ?
yeah , it &apos;s a formula for micro preemies
that determines their chances of survival .
we don &apos;t use it here .
why ?
nope .
chance of survival--
still a whopping 13 % .
that &apos;s why . it freaks parents out .
morning .
dr. robbins ,
14.3 today .
well , at least that &apos;s headed in the right direction .
on the other hand , uh , we got the x @-@ rays back ,
and he &apos;s developed nec .
his bowels are rotting ,
and unless we get in there and fix it--
the mortality rate of that surgery is over 50 %
in a preemie this size .
survival rate for treating nec surgically
has gotten way better .
guys , hold on . listen ,
you &apos;ve got plenty of decisions to debate down the line ,
too many .
all right ? this one &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
you don &apos;t operate , he &apos;s gonna die . simple as that .
dr. karev is right .
well , i guess we have no choice .
i will see you at lunch , all right ?
oh , dr. bailey , is the dumbbell tumor still on the books ?
yes , all good to ...
is meredith out sick today or ...
she came in early to study with torres . why ?
um , no , no reason .
it &apos;s just that she usually ...
drops zola off .
so ...
um , i &apos;ll see you up there .
okay .
say good @-@ bye ...
so if you could take a look again at chart 9 @-@ c ,
you will see the potential effect
that , uh , uh ... i &apos;m sorry .
uh , it &apos;s not 9 @-@ c.
where is it ?
anyway , um ...
as you can see , uh ...
it &apos;s--it &apos;s really cool .
i , uh , just , uh , need a minute to find it .
i have 3 @-@ d models of stem cells
so you can see them working together
to grow a heart .
i just need a second to find it .
no problem .
dr. altman , we have your material .
it should be enough to go on .
oh , okay .
uh , well , um ...
just please remember that this research can save
tens of thousands of lives ,
so , um ...
please consider it carefully .
what do we got ?
espresso machine exploded
at a coffeehouse on roosevelt .
got a 24 @-@ year @-@ old female
with second @-@ degree burns on her chest , neck , and face .
oh , god . is my face melted ?
is that a large @-@ bore i.v. ?
i.v. &apos; s in the left arm .
that &apos;s not what i asked you .
you should &apos;ve put in a large @-@ bore i.v.
it &apos;s a 20 gauge . do you want me to--
i &apos;ll do it myself since i want it done right .
what &apos;s your name ?
angie . is my face melted ?
no , angie . try and relax . get a burn kit .
37 @-@ year @-@ old male , hypotensive in the field ,
resolved with fluids .
open proximal humerus fracture
and multiple lacerations and abrasions .
an espresso machine did this ?
blew him clear across the shop and into some shelves .
and the parts that didn &apos;t hit him went through the wall
and into the next store .
okay , let &apos;s page , uh , dr. torres and dr. hunt .
all right . he &apos;s got shrapnel in his chest . let &apos;s page cardio .
angie . is angie okay ?
who &apos;s angie ? is that your wife ?
my barista .
adele ?
adele !
oh , god .
adele .
are you okay , honey ?
it was a fiasco .
oh , it couldn &apos;t have been that bad .
it was precisely that bad .
no , but it &apos;s stem cells . it &apos;s the future .
i mean , they know that .
no , it &apos;s dead , just like my husband ,
who is also dead .
there &apos;s a theme here . are you noticing ?
teddy--
whatever . i don &apos;t care .
the nice part about having a dead husband
is that you stop caring about anything at all .
you should ask owen to put in a good word .
the chief of surgery
can have a lot of pull in the decisions .
i don &apos;t talk to owen hunt .
out of the way , grey . i need to get in there .
we &apos;ve got a white out on the right . yang , chest tube .
sure .
rough night last night ?
hmm ?
you didn &apos;t come home .
oh , yeah . uh , m.v.c.
i texted , but , uh , you must have been asleep .
okay , devin , we are gonna give you some pain meds .
and we &apos;re gonna put a tube in your chest
that will drain the blood ,
and you will start to feel a lot better .
i just ran into teddy .
she said that she blew her pitch to the board this morning .
it might be nice if you backed her up , you know ?
put in a good word .
pulse is faint on the left . i need a c.t. angio .
okay , devin , once we get this tube in ,
we &apos;re gonna take you to ct .
do you have any family we need to contact ?
my parents are old . i don &apos;t want to worry them .
if you could just let angie know i &apos;m okay .
she &apos;s probably worried .
i &apos;m sorry . who &apos;s angie ?
uh , the burned barista in trauma one .
dr. grey , dr . webber &apos;s in the e.r.
yeah ?
no , he &apos;s in the e.r.
i @-@ i checked the over pressure valve .
i @-@ it was fine .
or was that yesterday ?
oh , god , is this my fault ?
did i melt my own face off ?
nothing &apos;s been melted off . try to stay still , please .
i mean , they can &apos;t expect me to monitor the machine
and handle the morning rush , right ?
i really need you to stay still .
i mean , it &apos;s too much pressure , this job .
not enough pay and way too much pressure .
i mean , you guys have no idea .
we &apos;re fixing your face . that is pressure .
now if you could do us both a favor and--
dr. avery , go get us some more bandages .
now .
sorry about that .
you continue to clean here . i &apos;ll be back in a second .
okay , doctor .
you yelled at a patient and a paramedic ,
two people you do not want to piss off .
what &apos;s your problem ?
i &apos;m sorry , all right ?
i &apos;ve just been so tense . i &apos;m studying for the boards .
we &apos;ve been studying . you &apos;ll do fine .
i can &apos;t do fine . i have to do great . i &apos;m an avery .
are you getting any ...
did you just ask me if i &apos;m getting any ?
when was the last time ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
just tell me .
i won &apos;t judge .
i am focused . there &apos;s no time .
there &apos;s always time .
my mother used to have trouble with the stove , too ,
and then she started getting lost driving ,
and then she started leaving the house
in the middle of the night .
adele &apos;s fine .
and we &apos;re-- we &apos;re managing .
rose ridge is top @-@ notch--
great doctors , great facility .
yeah , i know , i know . we &apos;re just not there yet .
any deeper ,
and this burn could &apos;ve retired you from surgery .
yeah , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll look into it .
you &apos;re just trying to shut me up .
yeah , how am i doing ?
i don &apos;t have pull many places ,
but i &apos;m kind of a big deal there .
so if you need me to make a call for you , i can .
good . only a little of the bowel is necrotic .
there should be more than enough to salvage .
maybe his dad should factor spunk
into his stupid algorithm .
he &apos;s a fourth year . he knows just enough to be annoying .
well , he &apos;s acting like the baby is already dead .
but look at him . he &apos;s a champ .
you &apos;re like a little muhammad ali , aren &apos;t you ?
someone &apos;s peppy .
she &apos;s on a vacation from lost @-@ cause brain surgeries .
she needs to have some fun today .
you know what &apos;s really fun ?
removing dead bowel . you want to make the cut ?
really ? are--are-- are you sure ?
yeah . get over there before i change my mind .
okay , the tissue rips really easily ,
so only press down as hard as you would need to cut a hair .
so torres and i assessed his shoulder ,
and i mean , wow .
so we both agreed--
yeah , let &apos;s just do this . uh , sir .
we &apos;re gonna take a scan of your chest and your arms . here you go .
so just try and relax .
my friend angie , is ... is she okay ?
she &apos;s got some bad burns , but she &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s my fault for going in during the rush .
she gets too flustered around me .
and the sexual tension &apos;s been building for months .
you know , a look here , a smile there .
it can be hard to focus
with all those pheromones buzzing around you .
i should &apos;ve known it &apos;s become dangerous .
okay , well , let &apos;s get you and your pheromones into the scan .
yeah , lately , she &apos;s been taking it to another level ,
adding these foam leaf designs on top of my coffee ...
handmade , just for me .
it &apos;d be great if i could send angie
a cappuccino or something .
let her know i &apos;m doing okay .
nicely done .
so now what ?
even if he stabilizes ,
he &apos;s looking at years of procedures and surgeries .
his parents are residents .
they can &apos;t both quit ,
and medical care for a little guy like this is expensive .
you really know how to take the fun out of a party ,
you know that ?
damn . looks like he &apos;s in cardiogenic shock .
push epi and atropine .
d @-@ did i--
no , no , no , no . you did just fine . it &apos;s just that--
he &apos;s bradied down to 52 .
grey , start c.p.r.
his heart hasn &apos;t stopped .
with preemies , we start c.p.r.
when the heart rate goes below 60 .
now use two fingers , light pressure . go .
we get seven major newspapers here every day ,
as well as live readings from local authors .
oh , look , adele , a mystery section .
she loves mysteries , don &apos;t you , honey ?
our librarian reads a chapter every day after dinner .
actually , we &apos;re just finishing &lt; i &gt; death on the nile , &lt; / i &gt;
so if you know who done it , keep it to yourselves .
should we check out the gymnasium ?
we just added a piloxing class .
every room is different ,
but they all have their own instant call button for attendants ,
your own bathroom , and a nice view of the grounds .
i &apos;ll leave you two alone
so you can look the place over on your own .
if you have any questions , i &apos;ll be at the front desk .
what do you think , adele ?
it &apos;s nice .
but it &apos;s too small for us .
you &apos;re a doctor .
you said that you could afford a house .
we certainly couldn &apos;t possibly start a family here .
richard ,
where would the nursery go ?
you &apos;re right , honey .
it &apos;s too small .
i said i &apos;d get you a house .
let &apos;s go .
i got it .
got what ?
the grant .
$ 4 million to grow hearts from stem cells .
you got it ?
i &apos;m gonna grow hearts . can you believe it ?
oh , god , teddy , that &apos;s amazing .
i @-@ i must have not done as bad as i thought this morning
unless--or i charmed them with my fumbling desperation .
i @-@ i have no idea . i don &apos;t care . i got it .
we were able to cut out most of the necrotic bowel ,
but then he went into c.h.f.
oh , my god .
morgan , he &apos;s 24 weeks old .
born 16 weeks early .
this shouldn &apos;t be a shock . he wasn &apos;t ready .
but there are a few things that we can try
to help oxygenate him better .
and then hopefully , he &apos;ll get stronger .
we could use liquid ventilation .
which could cause hypocarbia .
we could put him on a high @-@ frequency oscillator .
which could cause air trapping .
or we can put him on ecmo .
which , uh , just to get ahead of you , chris ,
we don &apos;t think he would survive at this stage .
okay , but before we do anything ,
we just need to know how aggressive you want to be .
i think we stop . we stop right now .
there are-- are plenty of options . we ...
we should use them .
these are his chances of survival , right here .
this is reality .
now you &apos;re a doctor . think like one .
if you had a patient with odds like that ,
would you operate ?
i &apos;m sorry about earlier . the way i --
my behavior was completely unprofessional .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i was freaking out .
look at you two , getting along .
you date doctors , angie ?
do not listen to this man . he thinks i need to be set up .
he does need to be set up .
he &apos;s shy , needs a little push .
devin is heading into surgery .
he wanted me to give you this ,
tell you not to worry , etcetera .
so ... here .
devin ?
the guy -- guy from the accident .
o @-@ okay . i ...
you know , the -- the customer you flirt with every day ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have no idea who he is .
sweet , nerdy type .
you put those foamy leaves
on the top of his coffee ?
i @-@ i have to make those leaves for everybody .
it &apos;s a new company policy .
i &apos;ll take it .
get your own .
that &apos;s not my point .
i can &apos;t believe that they &apos;re not gonna do anything .
i mean , they are basically
giving this kid a death sentence .
chris just wants to get back to his residency ,
and morgan is too weak to even think straight .
the parents have made up their minds .
just let me eat my food in peace .
ali doesn &apos;t even have any parents as far as i can see .
and you know what ? she is your intern .
you need to step up .
give me those . she won &apos;t shut up .
no , i &apos;m studying .
okay , look , all i am saying --
look , let it go , lexie .
all i am saying is ,
parents did not decide his treatment plan ,
doctors did .
math did .
get your own .
hey , so it turns out devin needs a thoracotomy .
your surgery .
remember devin ,
likes coffee , is in love with his barista ?
what about me ? remember me ?
have you , uh , hit that ?
which that ?
that -- the brown @-@ haired that .
oh , the that with the brown hair
and the nice ass and the perfect --
teeth , yes . have you ?
uh , no . mnh @-@ mnh . she only goes for the attendings .
next year .
good job .
did you see that ?
what ?
the way that woman looked at me and zola .
derek , we &apos;re hot doctors with babies .
women are gonna stare .
i think she &apos;s racist .
oh , i get it .
you &apos;re worried about bridging the cultural divide .
i know all about it .
that &apos;s why i learned spanish .
es la verdad , si ?
mi senorita chica muchacha yo soy . el papi de tu ,
sofia @-@ rita .
besome mucho .
you know she doesn &apos;t speak spanish ?
oh , but she shall .
verdad ? hablas mucho ?
you shall .
see ? bridging the divide .
how &apos;s it going with your better half ?
he &apos;s uptight , worried about the boards ,
snapping at patients .
i &apos;m trying to get him laid , but --
i &apos;m talking about julia .
oh . of course .
she &apos;s , uh ...
she &apos;s good , thanks . she &apos;s doing well .
good .
hello .
hey .
i , uh , i have to listen to his chest .
hey , ali . how you doing ?
why do you call him that ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s for the preemie babies without names
or the ones with weak names , like , uh ,
felix or claude .
you know , we like to give them fighters &apos; names ,
like boris or butch or ... molly ,
you know , to help them weather the storm .
i like that .
we &apos;ll take what we can get .
how are his lungs ?
well , they &apos;re still wet , so i may up his lasix .
his pulse ox isn &apos;t great either .
uh , where &apos;s chris ?
i don &apos;t know .
he keeps saying that he &apos;s making calls ,
updating his family , but ...
i think he just can &apos;t be here .
do you think we &apos;re doing the right thing ?
well , as a doctor ,
i look at ali &apos;s odds , and i &apos;m not very optimistic .
but ...
hey , i &apos;ve seen parents who , uh ...
they don &apos;t think like doctors .
they see things that , uh , we don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you what to do ,
but i will say this , you-- ali , he &apos;s got a--
he &apos;s got plenty of doctors in his corner .
you make sure he &apos;s got a parent .
dr. karev .
we &apos;re , uh , thinking of naming him thomas ,
after my dad .
is that tough enough ?
tommy ? tommy &apos;s good .
you paged ?
uh , yes . when you finish your surgery with torres ,
i need you to check on my post @-@ op patients .
i &apos;m going home .
something happen ?
uh , adele &apos;s e &apos;t having a good day .
rose ridge , richard .
i &apos;m telling you , you really should look into it .
we went to rose ridge .
rose ridge doesn &apos;t have anything that i can &apos;t give her .
rose ridge is not the answer .
she burned your hand .
you think you can handle this ,
but you can &apos;t .
i know . i have been through this .
the difference between you and ellis
and me and adele , meredith ,
i made vows to adele ,
vows to cherish her and be true to her ,
in sickness and in health ,
vows that i have broken time and again .
the least i could do is honor her in sickness
and give her the home that she deserves
and the best care there is .
she stays home , and if necessary ,
so do i.
did you have any pets growing up ?
a f @-@ fish tank , couple of hamsters ,
two dogs--why ?
i &apos;m just trying to get to know you better . that &apos;s it .
okay .
what were your dogs &apos; names ?
well , let &apos;s see . uh , there was buster
and , um ...
pickles .
pickles was a schnauzer--
what &apos;s your mother &apos;s maiden name ?
are you hacking me ?
i need the nurses &apos; schedule .
i don &apos;t schedule the nurses .
if you knew anything about how this hospital was run ,
you would know--
you know the nurses &apos; schedule .
you are april kepner .
you know everything .
anyone in particular ?
uh , um , emily someone .
emily . let &apos;s see .
ah . she was on days in the c.c.u. ,
but then she switched to nights
in the surgical i.c.u. handling traumas ,
which is weird ,
but dr. hunt signed off on it , so it should be fine .
hey , if i see her crying or bleeding ,
i &apos;ll come after you ...
hacker .
iliac artery is mobilized .
okay . let me get in there .
you know what might be fun ?
i have no idea what might be fun .
a play date with zola and tuck .
oh . uh ...
well , tuck &apos;s 5,
and zola &apos;s , what , 1 ?
1 and a quarter .
but it &apos;s more like she &apos;s 3 . she &apos;s very mature .
playing for tuck means throwing things ,
breaking things , um ,
shooting things at people and things .
i don &apos;t think zola would survive a play date with tuck .
yeah . it &apos;s probably not a good idea .
forceps , please .
the @-@ there &apos;s gotta be some kids down in day care
closer to her age ,
even if they aren &apos;t as advanced .
i just--i don &apos;t want her to feel out of place .
it might be nice if she could hang out with ...
kids who ...
have the same , uh ,
same ... roots .
roots ?
you know ...
okay , let &apos;s just resect the tumor .
the oscillator isn &apos;t the answer .
then liquid ventilation .
i @-@ it could improve his lung function . morgan .
you--you are his dad , not his doctor .
you can &apos;t just give up .
it &apos;s not about giving up .
he &apos;s still alive .
it &apos;s about doing more harm than good .
how is letting him die good , chris , how ?
i know you .
deep down , we &apos;re both thinking the exact same thing .
tell me what we &apos;re thinking , chris .
we &apos;re thinking that getting pregnant was an accident ,
that this baby
should not be alive right now ,
that its chances of survival
or having any kind of life worth living are slim to none ,
that doing every damn thing we can to keep it alive
is just so that we can feel good about ourselves after he dies .
now can you admit any of that ?
just go .
you can &apos;t cut me out of these decisions .
i &apos;m not cutting you out .
i &apos;m offering you an out .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , take the out , chris ,
because maybe you can &apos;t admit it now
in the light of day ,
but you want it .
how are you doing on your end , torres ?
how are we doing , grey ?
uh , good .
i &apos;m just finishing up this arterial repair ,
and then i &apos;m gonna put in the rod .
it &apos;s bad enough the girl he loves has no idea he exists .
now the t.s.a. is gonna hassle him for the rest of his life .
burned barista doesn &apos;t know who he is ?
nope . never even heard of him .
where are we ?
dr. altman ?
he &apos;s fine . shrapnel &apos;s out .
good .
did you all hear that , uh , dr. altman
got a huge grant for her stem cell research ?
i did . congratulations , dr. altman .
thank you .
i hear that , uh , dr. silverman at wake forest
has been doing great work in stem cells .
maybe you should give her a call--
if i wanted your advice on my specialty , dr. hunt ,
i &apos;ll ask .
once teddy &apos;s done with the lung , you can get at the other arm
to get out the remaining shrapnel .
all right . okay .
here . i &apos;ll help you finish .
i &apos;ve got it .
no , no , it &apos;d be easier--
i said i &apos;ve got it . now back the hell off .
you &apos;re an attractive woman .
who ? uh , me ?
you and avery spend a lot of time together , don &apos;t you ?
we do , yes .
uh , but we &apos;re just study buddies .
i mean , we &apos;re not , you know ...
he &apos;s an attractive guy , nice bone structure ,
hypnotic eyes , etcetera .
i guess so ?
have you noticed how uptight he &apos;s been lately ?
uh , l @-@ like i said , we &apos;re study buddies , so ...
study buddies should help each other out ,
relieve some of that stress .
maybe extend that buddy relationship .
extend ? um ... i @-@ i don &apos;t--
you &apos;re two attractive people .
any thoughts on how to alleviate that stress ?
we could--we could go for more walks ?
walks are good .
walks are nice .
i was thinking , since you &apos;re already study buddies ,
you could extend that relationship ...
become the other kind of buddies .
are you--are--
i am .
dr. sloan--
everybody wins .
th @-@ this is sexual harassment . you know that , right ?
i think of it as sexual encouragement .
think about it , kepner .
take one for the team .
you got her the grant money .
look , i know you did . you have to tell her .
it &apos;ll help things between you guys .
no , it won &apos;t .
all right , then i &apos;ll tell her .
no , you won &apos;t .
you can &apos;t let her treat you this way .
when henry died ,
you were just doing your job .
you &apos;re not a bad guy .
how do you know ?
look , sometimes , you just lash out .
it might not be rational or fair ,
but you do it &apos; cause you have to .
if she needs me for that ,
if she needs a punching bag ,
a bad guy to point the finger at
and help her cope ,
then let that be me .
fine , you can be a martyr ,
but you still have to be the chief .
and what happened in that o.r. today ,
that should never happen again .
we were able to repair your lung and fix your shoulder ,
but you &apos;re gonna need months of rehab .
how are you feeling ?
like i got hit by a dump truck .
yeah , it &apos;s gonna feel like that for a little while .
but don &apos;t be afraid to use , uh ,
your p.c.a. pump for , uh , pain meds .
so has angie come by the room ?
i didn &apos;t miss her , did i ?
angie has no idea who you are .
what ?
that &apos;s--that &apos;s ridiculous .
