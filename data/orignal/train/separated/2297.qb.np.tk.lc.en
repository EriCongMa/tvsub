hades told me to pick three names
and chisel them onto the headstones .
he said whoever i picked would remain in the underworld .
get me zelena &apos;s baby .
i &apos;ll rip up the contract ,
and you can tell belle she &apos;s pregnant
without also having to tell her
she owes her baby to me .
my price ...
is her .
the young lady is engaged to me .
i am sir gaston ,
you , beast , have taken my love .
father ?
father , are you in here ?
i &apos;m right here , belle .
we &apos;re supposed to go riding today .
why aren &apos;t you dressed for it ?
plans have changed .
we have a visitor in the castle today .
the eldest son of lord legume .
father , no .
i do not want to meet any more suitors ,
especially not that cretin .
so you know him ?
well , i know of him .
he &apos;s supposedly the vainest man in all the land .
fancies himself quite the hunter ,
both of animals and women .
at least give him a chance .
don &apos;t judge someone until you know their whole story .
well , i know enough .
belle , wait .
there &apos;s more at stake .
on our northern borders ,
there have been skirmishes with the ogres .
good men have died .
that &apos;s horrible .
but lord legume has a powerful army .
if you were to marry his son --
what , marry him ? are you mad ?
what does mother have to say about this ?
she agrees with me .
i &apos;m not arranging a wedding , belle .
i simply want you to meet him .
am i too early ?
you &apos;re right on time . come in .
meet my daughter .
belle , this is gaston .
it &apos;s lovely to meet you , belle .
gaston , i @-@ i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is terribly awkward , isn &apos;t it .
do you hate these setups as much as i do ?
well , since you &apos;re asking , yes .
i &apos;ve heard you &apos;re a charming and intelligent young woman .
and you certainly live up to your name .
but ...
you &apos;ve heard of me ,
and you &apos;re not interested in this , which is fine .
i understand .
if it is your wish , i shall turn around and head home .
no hard feelings .
actually , uh ...
one walk couldn &apos;t hurt anyone .
belle .
i won &apos;t be separated from this child .
i need your help .
so , you accept who i am .
i have accepted that
no one will fight for a child like its father .
you &apos;ve proven that much .
but no dark magic .
you must have known what you were letting yourself in for .
when we were in camelot ,
merlin said that perhaps one day
someone would be able to wield
the power of the dark one dagger for good .
show me that you can be that man .
show me , and -- and we can save our child ,
and we can turn the darkness into light .
well , that &apos;s the thing with dark and light .
depends on your point of view .
in the end , you do what you can to protect those you love .
all right , well , i &apos;d never resort to darkness
because that &apos;s not what a hero does .
in the heat of the moment , you do whatever it takes .
you want a future with me ?
you have to do this my way .
hades thinks he can beat us .
it &apos;s time to prove him wrong .
when i burn these names from the graves ,
there &apos;ll be nothing keeping us here .
we can all go back home .
wait . something &apos;s wrong .
what is it ?
any captain worth his salt knows when a storm &apos;s brewing .
and trust me , we need to find shelter now .
go ! go !
well , that was quick . everyone okay ?
yeah , but something &apos;s out there .
something was in that storm .
mom !
bad dream ?
yeah . it was nothing .
sorry i fell asleep .
i &apos;m glad you did .
it &apos;s not the best way to keep watch .
i &apos;ve got it under control .
do you realize this is the first time you &apos;ve slept
since you rescued me ?
i will sleep for weeks
as soon as we defeat hades , i promise .
that &apos;s the signal .
they &apos;re ready .
mom .
is everything okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s just good to see you .
when you &apos;re done hugging it out , emma ,
i can use a little help here .
so this is what you &apos;ve been working on all night .
this is our new plan to defeat hades and go home --
a bunch of squiggly lines ?
hades put one hell of a protection spell on his elevator ,
and these &quot; squiggly lines &quot;
are the only way to crack it open .
then hopefully that elevator will take us straight to him .
maybe with surprise on our side , we can get a shot at him .
that &apos;s a lot of &quot; maybe &quot; s and &quot; hopefully &quot; s .
it &apos;s all we have right now .
okay . let &apos;s do this .
so much for surprising him .
oh , we &apos;ll think of something else . we always do .
what if ... ?
what if i could burn our names off the gravestones
that hades made for us , the ones holding us here ?
i looked for a spell like that . it doesn &apos;t exist .
actually , it does .
it kind of came to me in a dream .
in a dream ?
i know it sounds crazy , but i can remember every detail .
it would be a long shot , but ...
well , as for &quot; maybe &quot; s and &quot; hopefully &quot; s ,
i &apos;ve learned never to question yours .
i &apos;m coming with you .
snow and i will take henry back to the apartment , keep him safe .
no , actually , i &apos;m gonna go with emma .
no , no , that &apos;s not a good idea .
i promised to take down hades
and get back to our son , remember ?
if this is how we do it , i &apos;m in .
emma , i wouldn &apos;t argue with your mother .
trust me .
get going , and i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll meet you at the cemetery .
first , i should talk to my sister .
apparently , she has some history with hades .
you think she &apos;ll talk to you ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if he does have a weakness ,
she might be the only person who knows what it is .
now , this is just depressing .
look where gaston the great hunter ended up ,
and all because of a woman .
not that i &apos;m one to judge , believe me .
i &apos;ve had my own share of girl trouble lately .
lord hades . why are you here ?
there are some visitors in town
i think you might be interested in .
the beauty you were once engaged to
and the beast who stole her and then murdered you .
rumplestiltskin .
so the dark one is finally dead .
mm , not quite yet , but how would you like
to finally get your shot at revenge ?
why are you coming to me ? what &apos;s in it for you ?
things have changed in my little domain lately .
you know what i &apos;ve been finding growing all over town ?
that &apos;s impossible .
it should be because nothing grows here .
things only decay .
well , i don &apos;t understand . what &apos;s changed ?
hope .
thanks to these new arrivals ,
hope has taken root .
and when souls have hope , they move on .
and i cannot have that .
of course not , lord hades .
these interlopers must be punished ,
starting with the man who murdered you
and dared to go back on a deal with me .
but how am i supposed to defeat the dark one ?
check out the arrows .
i think you &apos;ll find them up to the task .
this is your chance to be a great hunter once again .
and this time your prey
will be the greatest beast of them all .
rumplestiltskin .
i have to say i &apos;m impressed how far you &apos;ve hiked .
i suppose your perseverance is matched only by your beauty .
really ?
does that line work on all your first dates ?
have we moved from a &quot; meeting &quot; to a date ?
you know what i meant .
i bet you think i &apos;m the same gaston
as all the stories you &apos;ve heard about .
i must say i have heard some unflattering tales .
well , then i profoundly apologize .
i have this friend lefou ,
who loves to spread tall tales to embarrass me .
ah , so you &apos;re -- you &apos;re not this great hunter of women
that i &apos;ve heard so much about ?
i hunt only wild game , i assure you .
my love life has been tragically empty .
actually , i &apos;ve spent my whole life
looking for a woman of real substance .
wait .
what is it ?
wild creature .
very large .
very close .
stay here .
gaston ?
gaston ?
gaston ? !
gaston .
well , i &apos;m afraid this won &apos;t be much of a hunt .
whatever that was , it fell into this old hunting pit .
impossible .
what is it ?
war is closer than we thought .
it &apos;s an ogre .
wha-- no .
there &apos;s never been an ogre anywhere near the castle before .
look at him . he -- he &apos;s barely full grown .
he &apos;s just a child .
maybe he wandered too far from home .
or maybe they &apos;re using their young as scouts
and an entire army &apos;s following behind .
we have to haul him up and take him back to your father .
what ? no , we can &apos;t .
we bring this creature back to the castle ,
the soldiers will torture him .
we have to find another way .
this isn &apos;t our decision .
the whole kingdom could be at risk .
i know .
and i realize you &apos;ve only known me an hour ,
but if you trust me , i promise i can find out
what this ogre &apos;s after without hurting him .
lead the way .
useless .
well , keep looking .
these books are full of light magic .
there must be something in here that can help .
if we wanted to boil a pot of tea , yes .
so every time you try something nefarious ,
it &apos;s a smashing success ,
but when i ask you to channel that power for good , you fail .
i don &apos;t care what merlin said .
to be able to turn darkness to light is a fool &apos;s errand .
to use darkness for light , that may be possible .
i won &apos;t allow it .
then we &apos;ll fail .
wait , what ? this was a mistake .
i shouldn &apos;t have come here .
belle .
belle , please , come back .
i don &apos;t want to hear any more justifi--
gaston ? !
what are you doing here ?
he killed me . i &apos;m gonna return the favor .
it &apos;s gonna take much more than a pointy stick to kill me .
we &apos;ll see about that .
interesting choice of weapon .
so it was hades who sent you ?
he and i want the same thing -- to make sure you stay down here .
stop ! stop !
gaston , we all have history together ,
but there must be some other way to resolve it .
i have been trapped down here for years ,
suffering and miserable because of him .
so , no .
i can &apos;t let the beast go free .
so , you killed gaston , my fiancé ,
and never thought to tell me ?
it was an arranged marriage . i was doing you a favor .
this -- this was a mistake .
once again , i &apos;ve let my optimism cloud my judgment .
his threat is real , you know .
i may be immortal , but hades forged these arrows
in the river of souls ,
a river which flows right into this very sea , in fact .
now , immortal or not , one scratch ,
and i &apos;m trapped in these waters forever .
and i won &apos;t be able to help our child .
hades is clever .
he sent gaston because he knows you won &apos;t let me hurt him .
let &apos;s prove him wrong .
let me use just a little bit of dark magic --
just enough to take care of gaston .
no . that &apos;s no not how we &apos;re gonna defeat him .
we &apos;re gonna do the opposite . we &apos;re going to help him .
we &apos;re gonna see to it that he finally moves on
from this infernal place .
belle , please , he &apos;s not worth it .
it &apos;s not just about him .
hook said that when his brother moved on ,
that it affected hades somehow .
it weakened him .
so by helping people move on ,
maybe that &apos;s how we defeat hades .
the spell worked in my dream .
now i just need to make it happen .
emma , wait .
any captain worth his salt knows when a storm &apos;s brewing .
and trust me , we need to find shelter .
why did you just say that ?
oh , it &apos;s fine , love . it &apos;s just a storm .
i &apos;ve survived worse .
no , i should not have brought you here .
my dream -- it wasn &apos;t just a dream .
this is exactly how it happened .
can we talk about that a bit later ?
we need to take shelter now .
well , look at that . the world &apos;s fastest storm .
maybe this is turning into a good dream .
it wasn &apos;t the storm i was worried about .
in the dream , the cyclone brought a monster .
what kind of monster ?
that kind .
i &apos;ll take a look .
no !
mom , you just have to trust me . i can &apos;t let you do this .
okay . okay , emma .
it was your dream .
you tell us . what do we do now ?
we run .
you want some company ?
how &apos;s my daughter ?
safe .
hidden in the woods with robin hood .
hades will never find where they are .
he &apos;ll find her eventually .
when he wants something , he never gives up .
and you know this how ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
zelena , for once in our lives ,
maybe we can just try
acting like sisters .
what happened between you and hades ?
he fell in love with me .
i know . it was totally ridiculous .
the idea that anyone could love me ...
do you love him ?
i can imagine how hard this is for you ,
but you know hades .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s keeping us all down here .
so i need to know what his weakness is .
so this little visit wasn &apos;t just sisterly concern .
it was about hades .
no , it was both .
well , i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have more to offer ,
but as far as i know ,
i &apos;m his only weakness .
okay , i know it seems a little creepy ,
but we should be safe down here .
are you sure about that ?
what the hell is that thing , and why is it chasing us ?
i don &apos;t know , but if it comes close ,
i can get a shot at it .
no , you cannot go back out there .
emma , what are you so afraid of ?
we &apos;ve faced monsters before .
my dream -- it &apos;s happening .
and there &apos;s something i didn &apos;t tell you .
you died .
belle , you don &apos;t need to do this
to find his unfinished business .
i know what it is -- killing me .
what -- no , no , i don &apos;t accept that .
you can &apos;t judge someone without knowing their full story .
here . gaston &apos;s locker .
um , can you , uh -- can you magic this open for me ?
well , i certainly can . are you sure you want me to ?
of course i &apos;m sure . why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
well , using my power to steal another man &apos;s property --
doesn &apos;t that qualify as dark magic ?
this isn &apos;t murder .
we &apos;re opening a locker .
oh , so you get to be the judge of
when the ends justify the means . i see .
as i said , it &apos;s all about points of view .
thank you .
this .
i &apos;m his unfinished business .
i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll wait for him . you should go .
trust me , i @-@ i can get through to him .
here , i found it .
&quot; an alphabetized inventory of magical antiquities . &quot;
sounds a bit dense .
no , this is a wonderful book .
it &apos;s a record of every magical item in the kingdom .
and you think one of them will tell us
what this ogre is after ?
i &apos;m sure of it .
that &apos;s why my mother keeps these records
- for emergencies like this .
your mother must be quite a woman
to have raised a daughter with this much ...
fire in her .
well , she was the one who taught me to love books .
starting ...
with this one .
&quot; her handsome hero . &quot; interesting .
i wouldn &apos;t have picked you for a fan of cheap romance .
no ! no !
this is not like that .
this book is about compassion and forgiveness --
the things that truly make a hero .
you , uh --
you can have it if you like .
if this is indeed your favorite book ,
i shall read every word ... twice .
because i have a feeling ...
i &apos;ve finally found a woman of substance .
i --
wait . look .
th @-@ this is what we need .
mirror of souls .
it says if someone has evil in their soul ,
it will be revealed in the mirror &apos;s gaze .
their eyes will glow with demonic fire .
so if we see no fire ...
then the ogre means us no harm .
this mirror &apos;s but an hour &apos;s ride away .
i @-@ i can go now .
good .
you can get the mirror , and i &apos;ll watch over the ogre .
but promise me , in case this creature &apos;s not innocent ,
you &apos;ll bring back your father and his knights .
i promise .
and i &apos;ll see you soon .
gaston ?
is that you ?
getting colder .
what do you want from me ?
you mean other than that baby in your belly ?
relax .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt either one of you .
actually i &apos;d like to help .
how would you like to make a deal ?
i married a man who makes deals .
i know what that means .
not interested .
what about what your father used to say --
&quot; don &apos;t judge someone until you know their whole story &quot; ?
how did you know that ?
i know lots of things .
perk of the job .
like you &apos;re trying to help gaston move on .
and so what if i am ?
oh , let &apos;s just say i like this little conflict
between gaston and rumple and want it to go on .
and what could you possibly offer me ?
ohh , nothing ... much .
just the thing
you want most in the world .
your baby .
got your attention now , don &apos;t i ?
i &apos;m listening .
smart girl because this is the easiest deal in the world .
all you have to do is let rumplestiltskin face gaston .
if one of them throws the other into the river of souls ,
i &apos;ll take the mark off your baby .
no .
i swore i &apos;d help gaston move on , and i keep my word .
now , that is such a nice sentiment , but take it from me .
love makes you do crazy things .
i bet , with your child on the line ,
you are capable of -- --
anything .
let me know if you change your mind .
i think that monster &apos;s gone away .
sorry , love .
well , i &apos;m glad your reflexes
are better than your sense of style .
well , this has turned into quite a day .
why are you all in my vault ?
short version -- thing with fangs trying to kill us .
and you &apos;re hiding instead of fighting ?
i saw the same monster in my dream .
and in the end , it ...
it killed me , so ...
i thought it was a message
or some sort of vision of the future .
well , you dreamt it . it &apos;s not like it &apos;ll happen .
maybe this dream isn &apos;t just about the monster .
it &apos;s about you working out some issues .
i don &apos;t have any issues .
much as it pains me ,
i have to agree with regina , emma .
what &apos;s going on ?
maybe i ... feel like i failed everyone .
failed ?
you saved me .
but we &apos;re still trapped in the underworld .
what the hell was i thinking bringing everyone down here ?
bringing henry down here ?
this was a terrible plan .
i should have done this alone .
now i &apos;m always frightened .
i &apos;m frightened that someone will die ,
and it &apos;ll be my fault .
and i &apos;ll never forgive myself .
emma , you didn &apos;t force any of us down here .
we all wanted to come with you .
we knew it would be hard .
these things always are , but some things are worth it .
love is worth it .
now , if you want to get home , let &apos;s do what works .
let &apos;s face this monster together .
i guess every beast has its weakness .
so you would really kill him if you had the chance .
yeah , i wasn &apos;t sure if you had it in you .
this is pointless , belle .
where is rumplestiltskin ?
look , gaston , please stop this .
i can &apos;t !
seeing him dead is the only thing i care about anymore .
are you sure about that ?
you broke into my locker ?
gaston , i want to help you move on .
if you still have this book ,
it must mean something to you .
of course it does .
is it because i gave it to you ?
am i your unfinished business ?
you think i have this book because i like it ?
i &apos;ve tried to throw this out a @-@ a hundred times , a --
a thousand .
it always reappears .
it &apos;s part of my punishment down here .
i don &apos;t understand .
this book reminds me why i died .
because you made me weak !
what ? me ?
i should have gone after rumplestiltskin with an army ,
but i tried to follow your example .
i tried to do what is right , but that book is wrong .
being a hero is not about compassion
and having forgiveness .
it &apos;s about strength !
doing whatever it takes to defeat your enemies .
but rumple isn &apos;t even your real enemy .
hades is .
why do you defend rumplestiltskin ?
he kidnapped you .
he made you a servant .
you should want him dead , too .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t .
why not ?
he &apos;s my husband .
good , old belle .
you always did have a soft spot for a monster .
gaston &apos;s keeping watch on the ogre ,
and this mirror will help us learn the truth of his intentions .
see , father ? the eyes don &apos;t lie .
i pray that you &apos;re right , belle .
gaston ?
gaston !
are you all right ?
it feels like i still have all my limbs .
what happened ?
the ogre had escaped when i arrived .
he was waiting in ambush .
then you &apos;re quite lucky to be alive .
i am so sorry .
this is -- this is all my fault .
it &apos;s all right , belle .
seeing your concern makes it worth it .
well , you two have had an interesting first day .
head back to the castle . i &apos;ll gather my soldiers .
we &apos;ll hunt this ogre down before he can do any more harm .
no , this ogre tried to kill me .
i should return the favor .
if you would allow , i &apos;d like to lead the hunting party myself .
you &apos;re a brave young man .
if you feel up to it , the hunt is yours .
then i &apos;m coming , too .
there &apos;s still a chance to use this mirror .
for what ?
we know this ogre &apos;s a monster .
well , perhaps he was just defending himself .
forgive her , gaston .
she gets this idealism from her mother .
father .
we must know the truth before we hurt him .
go home , belle .
it &apos;s what &apos;s best .
belle , it &apos;ll be fine .
i promise .
what kind of a deal ?
look -- look , it doesn &apos;t matter &apos; cause i said no .
take it from a man who trades in deals .
it matters very much .
what was the deal , belle ?
look , i tell you , you got to promise me something .
you have to promise me you won &apos;t hurt gaston
no matter what you learn .
belle , you can trust me .
all right .
he said that if i let you and gaston face each other
and one of you ends up in the river of souls ,
he &apos;ll then tear up the contract on our baby .
and you turned him down .
of course i did .
i failed once with gaston , but i can fix this .
belle , what merlin said about a man
that can control dark for good --
i really want to be that man for you .
truly .
just ...
not today .
hold .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
the ogre tracks stopped .
draw your weapons .
there !
don &apos;t let it escape !
the thing about an ogre is you got to
hit &apos; em right in the eye .
no !
what are you doing ? get away from that thing .
i won &apos;t let you kill him without knowing the truth .
it tried to kill me . and that &apos;s all i need to know .
no !
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s hurt .
what happened to him ?
gaston .
you ...
you did this , didn &apos;t you ?
you tortured this ogre while i was gone .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s why he attacked you .
i don &apos;t need an enchanted mirror to recognize a monster .
i &apos;m trying to protect this kingdom .
step aside .
this creature isn &apos;t the monster . you are .
and if you want to shot him , you &apos;ll have to shoot me first .
you &apos;ve made a fateful decision tonight .
i just hope , for all our sake ...
it was the right one .
revenge is such a tricky business .
i find it rarely ends well ,
unless , of course , you &apos;re me .
and now you get to spend eternity trapped in these waters .
you may destroy me ,
but you &apos;ll always be a beast .
well , i &apos;m all right with that .
you see , uh , this is the fun part .
rumple ! stop !
belle .
please .
for all that we &apos;ve shared ,
let me tell you one thing before you go through with this .
all right , belle , what is it ?
i just want to tell you
i @-@ i have always known who you really are .
and that &apos;s why i love you .
but i also know who i really am ,
and i can &apos;t let you hurt him .
in fact , i command you not to .
belle , you &apos;re making a big mistake .
are you all right ?
i will be .
what ? ! no !
it &apos;s happened , belle .
what has ?
the eastern regions have been breached .
ogres are coming .
it &apos;s war .
and you blame me .
blame is not important now .
what i did was the right thing .
it was foolish and petulant !
no , no , i did what i had to to live with myself .
and now we &apos;re at war .
has it occurred to you that our mistreatment
of their young could have caused this conflict ,
not my act of mercy ?
the reasons why no longer matter .
what does is that we must do what it takes to save the kingdom .
i &apos;m sorry , father .
i &apos;m ... sorry that it &apos;s come to this .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
our army is no match for theirs .
what will we do ?
gaston &apos;s kingdom --
their army could give us a fighting chance .
you think ... they would assist ?
with the right bit of diplomacy , perhaps .
you want me --
he still wants your hand , belle .
it could end the war .
you &apos;d be our hero .
belle .
has your father told you the good news ?
our kingdoms will unite , and we will defeat this threat .
and you will one day be sovereign over a land
far greater than has ever existed .
we will rule side @-@ by @-@ side ...
... if you will be my queen .
i will .
what have i done ?
i guess you were right .
darkness will always win .
i &apos;m so sorry , belle .
i never wanted this to happen to you ,
but you saved me .
you saved our child .
a @-@ actually , not so much .
sorry to break up this beautiful domestic scene ,
but your baby is still mine .
no , we had a deal .
gaston went in the sea .
i said i would break the contract
if gaston or rumplestiltskin threw the other in the river .
but since belle did the deed ...
what a @-@ a fun surprise that was --
no deal .
no . i will get my baby free of you ,
you monster !
me ?
well , you &apos;re the one who just doomed your ex @-@ boyfriend
to eternal torment .
don &apos;t listen to him , belle . he wanted this to happen .
why ? why did you push me to this ?
uh , i have my reasons .
now , this ..
is a beautiful flower ...
imbued with my favorite scent -
hopelessness .
um , i didn &apos;t order anything .
it &apos;s close !
keep your eyes peeled .
there .
nice shot .
wait , everybody stay back !
that thing could still be alive !
emma , stop ! don &apos;t kill it !
i think your dream was a vision .
but it wasn &apos;t about saving me .
it was about finding her .
red .
red ?
