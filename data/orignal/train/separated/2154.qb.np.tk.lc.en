you know , max ,
you can always set your account up for direct deposit .
that way , you won &apos;t have the hassle
of coming in the bank every week .
your time @-@ saving assessment is quite correct .
i &apos;ve had this thought myself ,
but eventually decided against it .
oh , yeah ? why is that ?
fbi crime data shows a spike in internet banking fraud .
most notably in direct deposit scams ,
which has turned out to be quite troublesome .
and here i thought the reason
you came in every week was to see me .
it is . uh ! uh ...
i @-@ i @-@ i ... i mean , uh , yes ,
you are the reason why i come in .
i was just looking for , uh , the right
moment to ask you for your ...

yes . uh , i believe my social calendar can
accommodate such an engagement .
how would 8 : 00 be ? i know
of a great sushi place ; uh ... serves raw fish ,
uh , with rice and cooked things , as well .

max ?
sabrina ?
hey guys , you looking for someone ?
yeah , we are .
we &apos;re looking for arlo .
arlo ?
it &apos;s cool , behati . i got &apos; em .
are you sure ?
they look like a couple of dangerous types .
maybe i should frisk &apos; em .
yeah ?
no ? nice to meet you guys .
you , too .
you , too .
that flirt &apos;s getting into trouble all the time .
thought she was just kidding about the pat down ?
okay , you know what ?
for your sake , i really hope
gabby comes back soon .
funny .
look , guys , thanks for coming down , okay ?
i got a situation that &apos;s a little bit above my pay grade .
yeah ? what do you got ?
so i was doing my usual security sweep ,
and i found this in the models &apos; makeup trailer this morning .
&quot; you won &apos;t ignore me anymore . &quot;
who was it addressed to ?
that &apos;s the thing . we don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve got a number of girls in for the show tomorrow ;
it could be any one of them .
you ever had a stalking incident before ?
no , nothing .
but i got two of my guys
going through all the fan mail just to make sure
we didn &apos;t miss anything .
uh @-@ huh . excuse me a second .
it &apos;s mcgarrett .
okay , you got it . we &apos;re on our way .
feel very old , arlo .
nah .
uh , we caught a case .
well , uh , why don &apos;t i stay here with arlo ,
and you can take care of the , uh , other thing ?
why are you giving me a look ?
they called you . they didn &apos;t call me .
i could really use the help with this , bro .
you &apos;re gonna get the help . steve ...
i got this .
ooh , ooh , do me a favor .
what ?
could you drop this off by fong , get a handwriting analysis ?
absolutely , detective williams .
anything else i can do for you ?
no , i think that &apos;s it .
arlo , you need anything else ?
we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good ,
steve . thank you .
just behave yourself .
single gunshot wound to the abdomen .
her stomach &apos;s distended , she &apos;s tachycardic .
call ahead , notify the trauma team .
let them know there &apos;s a patient coming ,
and needs surgery right away !
max . hey .
i heard you were inside when it happened . you all right ?
yes , i &apos;m fine , thank you .
man , i know you &apos;ll need a statement from me right away ,
but i just need to get to the hospital .
a bank patron , jim rogers , was here ,
and then he rushed one of the gunmen
after they took a woman hostage .
that was smart .
or gutsy .
probably saved her life .
all right , so the gun went off during the struggle ?
yeah , it was a single round .
discharged into jim &apos;s chest .
injury was a through @-@ and @-@ through .
the bullet must have hit the second victim
after exiting jim &apos;s body .
max seemed pretty affected about this whole thing .
you know anything about the second vic ?
yeah . bank teller , 28 .
her name is sabrina lane .
apparently , max was coming in to see her
once a week for the past several months .
max has a girlfriend ?
yeah , romeo &apos;s been holding out on us .
how bad are her injuries ?
she was shot in the abdomen , lost a lot of blood .
it &apos;s too soon to tell .
now , the bank manager says that only $ 5,000
was taken by the robbers , all from the teller drawers .
they never even made a move for the bank vault
or the safety deposit boxes .
anyone get a look at these guys ?
no , everyone was face down to the ground ,
eyes to the floor .
then the gun went off , and it was chaos .
let &apos;s pull footage from all these cameras ,
see what they tell us .
thanks .
that was max .
jim rogers is out of surgery .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
all right . what about sabrina ?
no update on her condition .
she &apos;s still under the knife .
hey , you guys need to see this .
so , i reviewed the bank &apos;s surveillance footage ,
and it turns out , both of the cameras had a perfect
vantage point , but we got one problem .
something wrong with the cameras ?
no , according to the bank , they &apos;re functioning perfectly .
okay , then i just have to ask ,
where are their heads ?
that &apos;s what i was gonna ask you .
mr. fong ...
you have any luck getting a usable image ?
unfortunately , no .
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to be able to .
but ... there is something you can help me out with .
here . put this on .
seriously ?
it &apos;s for demonstration purposes only , so ,
please indulge me .
how do i look ?
now stand under that surveillance camera .
now take it off .
what &apos;s the trick ?
infrared radiation .
invisible to the naked eye ,
yet disruptive to ccd sensors like the ones in video cameras .
so i take it these aren &apos;t rhinestones ?
infrared leds .
our suspects must have sown them into the shirts--
very high tech .
okay , so maybe this bank robbery wasn &apos;t amateur hour after all .
but if that &apos;s the case , then why only take five grand ?
hello .
hi .
behati , right ?
that &apos;s right .
hey . danny .
this is nina .
hi , nina .
hi .
monique .
hello .
hi .
hi . i &apos;m danny . nice to meet you guys .
nice to meet you .
let me guess . you &apos;re a cop ?
uh , yes , i &apos;m a cop . what gave it away ?
slacks and a button down .
aha ! well , at least i &apos;m not wearing a tie , right ?
how old &apos;s your daughter ?
my daughter .
how do you know i got a daughter ?
you run a background check on me ?
no . you have some glitter on your shirt .
oh ... yeah , she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s obsessed with the stuff .
do you have any pictures ?
of my daughter ?
yeah . pic ...
yes . she &apos;s my pride and joy .
i got plenty of pictures .
show us some .
you want to see ?
yes . yes , please .
join us on the couch .
what , right here ?
yeah . okay .
let &apos;s see . this is grace when she was , uh--
hello-- when she was , uh , three .
this is her when she was just a little baby girl .
yeah . oh , my gosh , she &apos;s so cute .
she &apos;s pretty , right ?
her mother must be gorgeous .
her mother &apos;s a very pretty lady ,
but people say that she , um ... she looks like me .
i don &apos;t see it .
you don &apos;t , huh ?
no .
i &apos;m kidding .
i &apos;m just busting your stones .
that &apos;s very nice .
you guys , this is , um ...
this is my most favorite day of all time
in the history of my life , but i do have a purpose here .
i have to ask you guys some questions privately ,
one at a time , so , uh , who wants to go first ?
me .
okay , good .
i &apos;ve got a lot of ex @-@ boyfriends , a lot of ex @-@ managers .
i bet you do , but , um ,
at the risk of sounding indelicate , uh ,
which one of them do you think would like
to see your head hanging on a wall ?
franco .
definitely franco .
aha . does franco have a last name ?
angeleco .
franco angeleco , the race car driver ?
wasn &apos;t he , uh , killed in a grand prix last year ?
yeah . he hated me for breaking up with him .
i @-@ i mean , i was thinking , uh , more along the lines
of somebody more current .
that &apos;s not what you asked me , detective .
you asked who didn &apos;t like me .
franco was the only person i could think of .
people think it &apos;s easy what we do--
you know , just stand there and look pretty--
but it &apos;s a whole mindset .
i &apos;m not just selling a product , i &apos;m selling a fantasy .
so many times people confuse
the fantasy with reality .
they think that ... they know you .
that , you know , the girl in the magazine and on tv
is really me .
they don &apos;t understand it &apos;s just ...
a persona i take on ,
and that can be really scary sometimes .
police have confirmed two people were injured
during the violent robbery this morning ...
i should have done something .
done what ? they had guns .
when that customer rushed the robber ,
i could have helped him .
maybe sabrina wouldn &apos;t have gotten shot .
uh , max , listen to me , okay ?
you &apos;re in a life @-@ threatening situation ,
everything &apos;s moving so fast ,
a hundred miles an hour , don &apos;t second @-@ guess yourself .
sabrina &apos;s here .
she &apos;s alive right now .
if you hadn &apos;t have been there to help her ,
she might not be . okay ?
what are you gonna tell her , jim ?
that you were trying to play hero and got shot ?
come on , donna , i just want a few minutes with megan .
is that too much to ask ?
jim , you walked out on us six years ago .
the fact that we &apos;re even here is a big deal .
excuse us . pardon the intrusion .
hi . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
this is ... officer kalakaua .
we &apos;re with five @-@ o.
how you feeling , sir ?
i &apos;ve been better .
yeah , i bet .
i hope you guys understand the time @-@ sensitive nature
of this case , and if you &apos;re feeling up to it ,
we need to ask you a couple of questions , if that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s fine . i was just leaving .
donna , would you ...
good @-@ bye , jim .
let &apos;s go , megan . come on .
but i didn &apos;t get to say good @-@ bye to daddy .
pretty confident i could spot an ex @-@ wife when i see one .
you got it .
she &apos;s still ...
listed as my emergency contact .
actually , kind of get the feeling
she was a little disappointed i made it through .
that bad , huh ?
yeah .
whatever happened to &quot; forgive and forget , &quot; right ?
look , um , the nurse told me
that someone else was shot .
the bullet went in and out of me ?
yeah , it was a bank teller .
is she okay ?
it &apos;s too soon to tell , sir .
we were hoping that you might be able to
help us catch the guys who did this .
yeah , yeah , any @-@ anything i can do .
okay , um ,
well , the security footage from inside the bank
wasn &apos;t much help .
but it appeared that you got a look
at the shooter when his mask came off ?
yeah , it &apos;s all such a blur , i mean ...
it happened so fast , but yeah ,
yeah , i kind of remember his face .
okay , excellent .
we &apos;d like to get you together with a sketch artist .
maybe get a composite out there to the media ,
hopefully generate a lead ,
maybe even get an i.d ..
yeah , absolutely .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little strange
the gunman grabbed the hostage
before the police arrived ?
well , not if they thought someone hit the silent alarm
and then they wanted insurance making their break .
no , but they had control of the floor .
no one had a chance to hit the alarm .
well , maybe they just grabbed a hostage
thinking if the cops did show up ,
then they wouldn &apos;t have to go back inside and get one .
i don &apos;t know . chin , what do you got ?
so , hpd recovered the backpack used in the robbery .
where about ?
bushes along the pali highway .
and here &apos;s the fun part :
all the cash was still inside .
robbers must &apos;ve ditched it after the dye pack went off .
okay , so two innocent people shot , all over nothing .
yeah , tell me about it .
i sent it to fong from processing ,
he came back with a print .
all right , we get an i.d. ?
yeah .
makani jacobs , 23-- long sheet ,
but all for small time muggings and liquor store jobs .
never taken on anything big like a bank heist before .
five @-@ o ! open up !
psychedelics , firearms--
looks like we missed the party .
maybe not .
hey , makani jacobs ?
hey , five @-@ o.
hands in the air .
okay , whoa-- lower them just a little .
yeah , that &apos;s good .
where you going , buddy ? hey !
hey , where you going ?
where you going ? !
hey ... aw , man .
got a suspect traveling on foot
heading south on koke street .
what &apos;s he wearing ?
nothing .
that &apos;s right-- he &apos;s bare @-@ ass naked .
oh , yeah , hey .
your turn-- fair &apos;s fair .
fair ? !
it &apos;s not fair . how is this fair ?
put your ...
put your hands behind your back .
and keep your legs closed .
you look like you can use a cup of coffee ,
and a sandwich .
don &apos;t worry .
she &apos;s not going anywhere .
i @-@ i &apos;m fine , thank you .
her folks are flying in ,
but they &apos;re not gonna be here for another several hours .
so i figured i &apos;d be here when she wakes up .
may i help with that ?
sure .
i got your message . what &apos;s going on ?
you got anything on my stalker yet or what ?
system kicked back a hit on handwriting .
okay , who is he ?
it &apos;s not a he .
it &apos;s a she .
name &apos;s denise pope , l.a. resident .
background says she was arrested two years ago
for attacking a movie star .
cut her pretty bad before they managed to arrest her .
why isn &apos;t she in jail now ?
good lawyer got her committed to a minimum security
psych home in camarillo .
only it didn &apos;t hold .
i reached out to the director--
it turns out she went awol two weeks ago .
all right , um , run facial recognition
on all the security cameras at the airport , okay ?
i &apos;m on it .
hey , arlo-- detective williams .
let me ask you a question .
you ever heard of a girl named denise pope ?
no ? okay , ask the girls ,
&apos;cause i think she might be our stalker .
got something .
all right , i &apos;ll call you back-- bye @-@ bye .
what &apos;s up ?
she &apos;s here , danny .
she flew in three days ago ,
under the alias &quot; janice meeks . &quot;
janice meeks-- we need to find her , now . okay ?
we already got you on indecent exposure and possession , makani .
we still got a problem-- it &apos;s a big problem--
&apos;cause that &apos;s nothing compared to bank robbery .
okay , so , jail time , no doubt .
but you play it clean from here on in ,
maybe we can help you .
aw , man .
i want to help ; i really do .
but like i said , i don &apos;t know nothing about robbing banks .
you don &apos;t know or you can &apos;t remember
because your cerebral cortex is fried from magic mushrooms ?
you &apos;re a real debbie downer , know that ?
yeah , you &apos;re a circus animal , what are you gonna do ?
how &apos;s this for a buzz kill ?
we have your fingerprints on a backpack
ditched along the pali highway .
you know what else we have ?
we have a gun that we found at your house .
and the gun matches the caliber of the gun that wounded
two people in the bank ...
whoa , wait a second-- two people ?
two people .
i thought there was only ...
the second victim was a bank teller ,
and she &apos;s touch and go .
and if things take a turn for the worse ,
you &apos;re going down for murder .
it &apos;s pretty psychedelic , huh ?
uh , uh ... all right , listen .
i was ... i was there , okay ?
inside the bank-- i &apos;ll give you that .
but murder ?
hell , no ! i didn &apos;t shoot no one .
all right , who did ? somebody did .
it was the other brudha , not me .
oh , the other brudha .
yeah .
what &apos;s his name ?
look , i don &apos;t know his name .
you don &apos;t know your partner &apos;s name , huh ?
i swear , i don &apos;t .
i was leaving my p.o. &apos; s office when this haole comes up to me .
i never seen the dude before , but he offers me 20 g &apos;s
to help him pull a bank job .
okay , let me get this straight .
all right ? just for me .
a stranger offers you a flat fee of 20 large
to help him pull a job that netted five ?
sure , that happens all the time .
it &apos;s the truth , man .
that &apos;s the way it went down .
i swear , the next thing i know , this lolo rushes him .
the two are going at it when the gun goes off-- his gun .
not mine .
then we ran out of there .
split in different directions .
and i haven &apos;t seen him since .
all right .
if what you &apos;re telling me is true
and you &apos;re not trying to protect the shooter ,
you &apos;re not gonna have a problem giving me a description , are you ?
no problem at all .
so , makani &apos;s sketch is on the left
and jim &apos;s is on the right .
eyewitness descriptions are notorious for being unreliable ,
but this is ridiculous .
well , maybe our naked hula dancer is still hallucinating .
actually it &apos;s jim &apos;s description i &apos;m questioning .
on the video , you see that
he only gets a split @-@ second look at the shooter before he gets shot ,
so it makes sense that he wouldn &apos;t remember details very well .
okay , i buy that .
but take a look at those two sketches .
they &apos;re almost the exact opposite of each other .
all right , we have to get both these sketches in front of jim rogers
and ask him what is going on .
how &apos;s it , charlie ?
hey . just in time .
i &apos;m comparing the bullet recovered from the bank teller
to the test fired round in makani jacobs &apos; gun .
well , that &apos;s not a match .
that &apos;s right .
okay , so makani &apos;s gun didn &apos;t fire the bullet ,
well , supports his story about him not being the shooter ,
doesn &apos;t it ?
you also need to see this .
okay , backpack used in the robbery .
red dye on the leaves .
could that have leaked out after the bag was thrown down the hillside ?
my first thought as well .
then i measured individual droplet size .
they &apos;re all less than one millimeter in diameter .
the only reason
that would happen is if the dye pack exploded inside the bag ,
right there in the bushes where it was found .
so you &apos;re saying that the bank robbers
threw out the backpack and all the money
even before the dye packs exploded .
that &apos;s the only explanation .
then why would someone go through all the trouble
of robbing a bank just to throw out all the cash ?
oh , oh , hey , steve ...
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s our guy .
go to jim &apos;s room right now . go , go , go .
out , out , out . get out of here !
up ! get up ! get up !
you all right ?
yes , i think i &apos;m okay .
steve !
steve .
jim &apos;s dead .
what ? ! how ?
strangled .
the suspect must have known he was talking to the cops .
but jim &apos;s sketch is useless .
it was makani &apos;s that put us on the shooter .
yeah , but the killer doesn &apos;t know that .
call hpd .
call hpd , have them put a personal security detail
on everybody that was in that bank .
okay ?
our gunman is tying up loose ends .
chin .
any luck cleaning up that footage ?
yeah , i reached out to an fbi contact
who recommended we try vascular mapping .
what is that ?
it &apos;s when you isolate a suspect &apos;s vein pattern
and run it against a federal database .
it &apos;s like a fingerprint .
got us a hit to a martin cordova .
this guy &apos;s a gun for hire
with ties to the sinaloa drug cartel ,
as well as west coast organized crime back on the mainland .
that &apos;s definitely the guy from the hospital .
that &apos;s good , because the fbi has him
as a suspect in over 20 unsolved murders .
they were closing in on him two years ago ,
but they lost the scent-- now he &apos;s mia .
okay , wait a sec .
so we have a mob enforcer who goes into hiding in hawaii ,
and now he &apos;s back as an inept bank robber ?
doesn &apos;t make sense , does it ?
okay , hold on a sec .
maybe we &apos;re looking at this all wrong .
what if this heist
was actually a hit disguised as a bank job ?
i like it ,
but the problem with your theory is cordova &apos;s m.o ..
his wet work is straight @-@ up , cold @-@ blooded kills ,
nothing ever this fancy .
and not to mention , if it &apos;s a hit ,
who &apos;s the target ?
the woman cordova took hostage .
yep .
okay , well , that would explain why they grabbed her
before the cops arrived .
okay , and a murder for hire plan
would also give credence to makani &apos;s story ,
about being paid 20 grand up @-@ front
for his role in the robbery .
yeah , he was unknowingly recruited
for a hit , not a heist .
you know , that would also explain
why they ditched the backpack
before the dye pack went off .
i mean , why keep it if the bills could be traced back to you .
exactly . we need to go back through this footage .
see if there &apos;s anything in there that can support this hired gun theory .
it &apos;s max .
yes , max ?
i think i have something .
during my postmortem examination ,
i noticed something significant
in jim rogers &apos; ct scan .
what was that ?
in medical terms , it &apos;s called
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma .
more commonly known as brain cancer .
inoperable , due to its infiltration
of the nervous tissue within the brain stem .
jim rogers was on the verge of dying .
he only had weeks to live .
i contacted jim &apos;s primary physician
and confirmed all my findings .
however , it &apos;s within my toxicological assay
where things got truly interesting .
the results showed that
there were diminishing levels of chemotherapy drugs
within jim &apos;s blood .
diminishing ?
okay , wait a second .
so jim not only knew he was dying ...
he was giving up the fight to live .
thanks , max .
hang in there , buddy .
guys , take a look at this .
what do you got ?
before makani and cordova make entry ,
check out jim .
he &apos;s pacing ,
he &apos;s checking his phone ...
he even exits the bank
and then almost immediately goes back in .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s stalling .
he &apos;s waiting for the robbery to get started .
yeah . and here &apos;s the kicker .
while you were talking to max ,
i looked into jim &apos;s financials ...
and found an undisclosed
withdrawal in the amount of $ 20,000 from his personal account ,
just two days prior to the bank robbery .
20 k .
so maybe our naked hula dancer &apos;s
not so crazy after all .
all right .
jim ordered this hit on himself .
he hired martin cordova to kill him
during the bank robbery .
fong , what &apos;s up ?
i got denise pope , danny .
where is she ?
where the models are staying .
the modern honolulu .
and get this :
she told the front desk she was part of the shoot ,
and demanded a room
right next door to behati prinsloo .
hey , arlo , it &apos;s danny . where &apos;s behati right now ?
she went back to the hotel . why ?
oh , my god .
who are you ?
didn &apos;t you get my letters , behati ?
please ...
don &apos;t hurt me .
you should have thought of that before you ignored me .
i &apos;m sorry , i never got your letters ,
i promise . please , just go .
we could have been such good friends .
you okay ?
okay . so the guy &apos;s terminal with the big c ,
he &apos;s gonna die anyway , i get that , okay ?
but to hire a contract killer and stage a bank robbery--
okay , why ? help me out with this one .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe @-@ maybe he was ashamed .
maybe ... maybe he didn &apos;t want anybody to know it was suicide .
okay , so he puts innocent lives at risk ?
one of them who &apos;s still
in the hospital recovering , i might add ?
no .
if it was suicide ,
he would have just swallowed a bullet .
&quot; whatever happened to forgive and forget ? &quot;
what ?
remember that ?
something jim said to us when we interviewed him ,
right after his ex @-@ wife and daughter left the room .
it &apos;s stayed with me ever since .
&quot; whatever happened to forgive and forget ? &quot;
well , his ex couldn &apos;t get out of the room fast enough .
whatever jim did to her , she couldn &apos;t forget .
wait a minute .
kono ...
what ?
jim staged this entire thing
so that he could redeem himself in the eyes of his family .
that is seriously insane .
i know it is ,
but people do crazy things
when it comes to their kids .
chin , what do you got ?
hey , i think i found a connection
between jim rogers and martin cordova .
lab results came back on cordova &apos;s blood--
this is from the sample we got when he escaped
through the window at the hospital ?
it turns out it also contained chemotherapy drugs .
okay ... so jim wasn &apos;t the only one battling cancer .
cordova was as well ?
okay , where was jim being treated ?
it could be where the two of them met .
guys ... five @-@ o.
have you seen this man ?
his name is martin cordova .
he probably checks in under an alias .
yes , i know him .
he calls himself jonathan medina .
okay , can you tell us where to find him ?
do you have his address ?
he &apos;s in treatment room 16 .
he &apos;s here right now ?
yeah .
right down the hall , first door on the left .
okay . listen to me very carefully .
i need you three to clear this floor , okay ?
i need it done quickly , but i need it done calmly .
you understand ? can you do that ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
hey . secure the exits .
i got cordova .
got it .
you looking for me ?
we found cordova .
the plan was to box him in ,
but i think something went wrong .
where &apos;s mcgarrett ?
that &apos;s the thing ; i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s not answering his phone .
trace it .
i &apos;ll call danny .
so where are we headed ?
shut up and drive .
we know about your cancer .
i know about jim &apos;s , too .
i also know why he hired you .
but the one thing i can &apos;t figure out ...
is why you agreed to do it .
i mean , he paid your accomplice 20 grand , right ?
he didn &apos;t pay you a dime .
we were diagnosed about the same time .
we had the same treatment schedule .
people tend to reveal a lot about themselves
when they &apos;re gonna die .
what did jim tell you ?
let &apos;s just say he made some bad decisions
when it came to his wife and his kid .
he wanted to turn it around , but ...
it didn &apos;t work out .
she didn &apos;t want anything to do with him .
wouldn &apos;t even let him see his own daughter .
how old are your kids ?
pull over .
let &apos;s walk .
so this whole thing was for jim to redeem himself ?
you stage a bank heist .
jim saves a woman &apos;s life ,
so he can die a hero in his daughter &apos;s eyes .
and you agreed to help him .
why would you do that ?
i &apos;m thinking , cordova ,
it &apos;s because your situation wasn &apos;t all that different .
am i right ?
just keep moving .
how many kids you got , man ?
one ? two ?
are they the reason you stopped killing people ?
a past like yours , it must be tough
coming to terms with your own mortality .
life full of regrets .
is that why you decided to grant a dying man
his final wish ,
cordova , because you felt
that somehow , some way ,
it might actually make up
for all the pain you &apos;ve caused , huh ?
stop .
turn around .
what did i tell you ?
take it .
do it .
i &apos;m dying anyway .
there &apos;s nobody here .
nobody will ever know what went down .
call it self @-@ defense .
there is no way .
i &apos;m gonna make it that easy for you .
it &apos;s either like this , or i go out the slow way .
i &apos;m tired of that option .
so you pull the trigger ...
... or i will .
get up .
get up .
you okay , steve ?
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna get your wish , cordova .
you &apos;re gonna die , but you &apos;re gonna die in prison .
book him , danno .
max , where are we going ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
you &apos;re really not gonna tell me ?
just close your eyes .
okay . now you can open them .
max , it &apos;s beautiful .
mahalo .
and now , for your dining pleasure ,
the bill of fare .
um , i think i &apos;ll have the c6 this evening .
the turkey and swiss on whole wheat .
excellent choice , madam .
i know it &apos;s not quite
the evening out that we planned , but ...
max .
it &apos;s perfect .
this is so cool .
if it &apos;s so cool ,
why do you got your face glued to your phone ?
come on , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m tweeting a picture
so my friends can see where i am .
