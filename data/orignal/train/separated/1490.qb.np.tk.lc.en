oh , god !
it &apos;s a little early , isn &apos;t it ?
go back to sleep . i don &apos;t need you awake for this .
honey , it &apos;s christmas eve .
are you gonna spend all day on that thing ?
i made a promise .
yes !
last christmas , phil got an elliptical machine
and vowed to walk the equivalent
of our house to canada in one year .
this body doesn &apos;t just happen , ladies .
if he didn &apos;t make it ,
no machine in the bedroom .
except for this machine in the bedroom , ladies .
who are these ladies ?
oh , phil , give it up .
oh , you would love that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
just when i &apos;m so close to the canadian border ,
i can smell the bacon
and the reasonably priced medications .
mom , this came for you from nana .
i don &apos;t know why she bothers to wrap it every year .
it &apos;s always the same thing -- slippers .
you never know . she might surprise you this year .
would you care to take a visit
to the museum of maternal indifference ?
watch it !
oh , careful !
you guys are really moving her downstairs right now ?
aren &apos;t you gonna be late for work ?
they &apos;re not gonna fire an elf on christmas eve .
ugh , i thought this would be lighter without my shoes on it .
you know , once you set up your room ,
you could put books on this .
books ... on a shoe shelf .
right .
you &apos;re not gonna jump on that ?
i &apos;m just too happy !
after today ,
there &apos;ll be no more clothes thrown everywhere ,
no more hour @-@ long phone calls
where all she says is &quot; no way . &quot;
i think it &apos;s a little sad
that you guys are doing this today .
i remember when you used to get
into the same bed on christmas eve
and talk about all the presents you were gonna get .
it &apos;s a perfect day for it !
when i wake up in my own room tomorrow ,
i &apos;m going to be giving thanks for my independence .
and isn &apos;t that what christmas is all about ?
seriously ? nothing ?
this is your great @-@ grandmother &apos;s recipe .
if she could see you now ...
... she would die again , because you &apos;re doing it wrong !
my mother has been here all week .
i love her very much , but you know what they say --
house guests start to stink after three days ,
like dead bodies .
what the hell is that ?
a fiber @-@ optic tree .
it &apos;s way better for the environment than a real one .
not if the environment is my living room .
look , i admit , it takes some getting used to ,
but so did greek yogurt .
now i can &apos;t even remember how the old stuff tastes .
why do we keep changing things that don &apos;t need changing ?
christmas is real trees and eggnog ,
perry como and bing on the hi @-@ fi .
now you &apos;re just making up words .
i &apos;m drawing a line in the sand .
we &apos;re gonna get a real tree ,
and we &apos;re gonna cut it down like i did when i was a kid .
follow me .
hi , dad .
can &apos;t talk . saving christmas .
hi . thank you again for coming .
no problem . i love babysitting !
good ! we &apos;re going to run some quick errands .
wait , if you &apos;re taking joe --
hola , claire !
around 4 : 00 , she gets fussy for her bottle .
lily , do you know why i &apos;m able to relax
and read this paper today ?
because you don &apos;t have a job ?
fyi , i am starting a new job in exactly t--
no . we &apos;re not doing this again .
it &apos;s because i planned ahead .
i finished my christmas shopping weeks ago .
it &apos;s important to keep busy .
i @-@ it is perfectly normal to take some downti--
no . no !
okay .
i printed out the directions to pepper &apos;s party .
we &apos;re calling it &quot; the 12 gays of christmas &quot; now .
oh , just be thankful
we talked him out of &quot; feliz navidude . &quot;
okay , honey , finish your breakfast
so we can go help our fellow man !
one hour at this charity event , max .
i can &apos;t eat .
i &apos;m too excited to get my puppy pound .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . your what ?
puppy pounds have six puppies
with online profiles .
ask your parents before using the internet .
honey , you never mentioned a @-@ a @-@ a puppy pound .
what is she talking about ?
i @-@ it &apos;s not on your list .
yes , it is . &quot; puppy pound . &quot;
oh , no ! she put a &quot; p &quot; backwards .
and , honey , there &apos;s a &quot; u &quot; in &quot; pound . &quot;
this says &quot; guppy pond &quot; !
guppy pond !
what is a guppy pond ?
it &apos;s only the -- the coolest gift ever !
i want a puppy pound .
um , honey , it &apos;s c--
okay .
i am not pointing fingers ,
but our daughter had
exactly one thing on her list ,
and someone didn &apos;t get it ,
so someone needs to go to the mall .
you &apos;re pointing fingers .
no . it &apos;s still a &quot; 1 . &quot;
it just fell asleep on the job .
ellipticaler &apos;s log , 12 / 24 .
10 miles from canadian border .
spirits -- high . stamina -- strong .
must get another application of thigh lube .
oh , good . luke .
dad , i was with you on the tightrope .
i was your wing man in the wing @-@ eating competition .
but i &apos;m not feeling this one .
you &apos;re missing christmas eve .
there &apos;s something more important than christmas , son
- pride .
if i don &apos;t make it to canada ,
your mom wins , and this baby
ends up in the garage first thing in the morning .
our garage ?
i &apos;m in charge of the recycling .
i &apos;m supposed to bring it from the garage to the curb
by 6 : 00 a.m. thursday morning .
i may have missed a few weeks .
shoot !
maybe more than a few weeks .
after a while , the pile just got so big ,
i couldn &apos;t bring it out the night before
or people would ask questions .
i don &apos;t need people asking questions .
then you &apos;re right ! you &apos;ve got to finish !
you &apos;ll never use this thing in the garage ! it &apos;s too drafty !
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to canada , buddy --
to avoid the draft !
no .
bang .
i know we &apos;ve been hiking for an hour , but ...
worth it when you look at this beauty , huh ?
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t cut down the first tree you see .
this is literally the first tree we saw .
there &apos;s our car .
no , we started that way .
so , you &apos;re arguing
that we walked entirely around the earth ?
give me the ax .
don &apos;t give me that look .
trees are like women .
the best ones make you work a little bit harder .
she &apos;s just not that into you .
i know !
sorry it too long !
oh , it &apos;s fine .
claire and i were having a nice time catching up .
i am really sorry that i am late .
no , you &apos;re not .
no , i &apos;m not .
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s fine .
just hope i didn &apos;t talk pilar &apos;s ear off !
no !
i love hearing about your family
and your big , new job !
oh , well , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not such a big job .
i mean , i &apos;m really just working for my dad .
but you &apos;re working hard .
i &apos;m proud of you .
how do they look ?
ooh ! perfect !
yes .
you are a wonderful student .
thank you .
my grandmother taught my mother .
my mother taught me .
and now , i teach claire .
and don &apos;t be so modest .
i respect a woman who can raise a family
and have a full @-@ time job .
can you believe that on fridays ,
they don &apos;t even have to dress up ?
taste . taste . taste .
sometimes , they even wear sweatpants .
would you like to lick the batter ?
yes ! oh , yes !
me , too !
no , no , no !
helpers only .
i don &apos;t make the rules .
oh , lily , what a beautiful ornament !
that &apos;s gonna make a little kid very happy .
wait . i don &apos;t get to keep this ?
why am i killing myself ?
okay , kids !
we &apos;ve got a visitor from the north pole ,
and he brought presents !
hey ! hey . how &apos;s it going ?
there are no puppy pounds anywhere .
it &apos;s like trying to find a cabbage patch kid
on christmas eve 1983 .
still hurts , huh ?
i had her bed all made .
okay . well , lily is gonna be devastated .
call around . get us on some lists .
you have to do something !
i &apos;ll figure it out .
how &apos;s the fundraiser ?
oh , well , i &apos;m managing , you know .
oh , bring the checkbook .
you can always tell when they &apos;re gearing up for the big ask --
fill you full of freebies .
oh , hey , i gotta go . got to help somebody .
hi ! classic .
flawlessly executed .
if i had one ...
just trying to bring a smile to you folks .
you &apos;re gonna get through this .
get through what ?
don &apos;t be embarrassed .
everyone here is in the same boat .
we are ?
best thing about the hot chocolate --
they let us keep the mug .
i thought it was a charity event for the needy .
turns out , it was a charity event for the needy !
look ! santa gave me a puppy pound !
what ? no .
i &apos;m finally happy !
i &apos;d like a picture for the newsletter .
oh . you can show your mommy .
i don &apos;t have a mommy .
this is why i do this .
that cramp could be a heart attack .
here &apos;s some advice i &apos;ve been holding back on .
always shave with the grain .
no reputable talent agent
will ever ask for money up @-@ front .
dad , you &apos;re fine .
i really want to quit , luke !
no , you &apos;re gonna make it !
he was never gonna make it .
i just needed to buy some time .
that &apos;s a lot of product you &apos;re moving .
just bring it to a recycling place .
not until i get paid .
just so you know , this is six weeks &apos; allowance .
oh , you have the coolest parents ever .
i want to know when you &apos;re about to leave ,
so give me a honk .
honk !
from your car .
the best business card is a firm handshake .
the best pick @-@ up line is a tight pair of dockers .
the best dockers are --
dad , save your breath ! you &apos;re in the last five miles .
i &apos;m never gonna make it !
of course you are !
then again , do what you want . i got stuff to do .
i &apos;m gonna quit .
cool .
what &apos;s one more failure ?
you ever wonder why we take such a crazy route to school ?
so i don &apos;t have to drive by certain places --
the flute teacher &apos;s house i went to once ...
the french cooking academy i quit after learning
only two of the five mother sauces ...
the hot yoga studio i left after &quot; happy baby . &quot;
i guess there &apos;s no avoiding
this big failure sitting in my garage .
get up .
i appreciate it , buddy , but --
get up .
i don &apos;t know anything about flutes
or cooking or happy babies ...
but i &apos;m damn sure getting my dad to canada .
now , mount that beast .
thank you , son .
you can thank me after you cross the finish line
and the celebration begins .
just picture that .
i &apos;m picturing it !
i &apos;m picturing it !
i &apos;m really picturing it !
thanks , santa .
yeah . you got it .
don &apos;t forget a candy cane from mrs. claus !
oh ! i got to take a break .
what ?
what ? what ?
um ... it &apos;s okay !
does anybody want to take a picture with me ?
i &apos;ll do it .
oh , maybe just the kids .
what was that ?
what was what ?
santa doesn &apos;t take breaks .
he visits the north pole !
and why do you leave your things all over ?
who do you think cleans this place up ?
oh , you are such a nag !
can &apos;t we at least
act like a happy couple during the holidays ?
for the children !
another hot chocolate ?
how many more of those are you going to drink ?
at least it &apos;s warm , unlike you !
he travels a lot .
she &apos;s put on cookie weight .
it &apos;s hard .
yes , you can put me on
the &quot; last @-@ minute shoppers &quot; waiting list .
unbelievable .
oh ! well , there he is !
h @-@ hey , jotham !
oh , looks like someone did
a little last @-@ minute christmas shopping .
that zaniel &apos;s a lucky guy .
yes , he is .
but these are for pepper &apos;s party .
his invitation said , &quot; no gifts , please . &quot;
mm , say that again ...
as pepper .
no gifts ?
please .
5 o &apos;clock , christmas eve ,
and i have to find a dozen perfect presents
for the world &apos;s snarkiest , cattiest men ...
my dear , dear friends .
pull ! pull ! pull !
yeah . hey , take a break .
this is taking forever .
it &apos;s supposed to .
took my dad and i all day to get a tree .
and when he finally brought her down ,
he used to celebrate with a cigar .
i was just a kid , so i &apos;d have a cigarette .
all right . grab the other end .
there we go .
now we got a groove .
yeah . there we --
it won &apos;t budge !
the hell is this wood made of ?
they ought to make saws out of it !
let &apos;s face it . the tree &apos;s beaten us .
hey , we &apos;re pritchetts . we don &apos;t quit .
besides , all my tools are stuck in it .
i got it .
it &apos;s simple physics .
a little pressure ,
the thing will snap where we put the blade in .
done .
just hit the gas .
it &apos;s working .
that &apos;s why they call it yankee engine--
get down !
it &apos;s bald on one side now !
it &apos;ll be fine !
we &apos;ll just comb over some branches !
oh , claire , i thought that you had left .
she was going to ,
but i wanted to show her how much better she looks
without this hair blocking her pretty face .
she does have beautiful hair , though .
i see .
what did she say ?
that you picked a good color ...
at least , i think that &apos;s what she said
with that american accent .
you don &apos;t have to entertain her .
after all , she &apos;s my mother .
ah , these used to be glorita &apos;s favorite !
she used to do headstands to get extra cookies .
at least , she &apos;d try .
yeah , but it &apos;s not easy !
i mean , it &apos;s hard enough to keep all this right @-@ side up !
imagine when i had to put it all right @-@ side down !
it was ...
oh , my gosh .
i can &apos;t believe i can still do it !
look at that .
oh , wow . look at claire , gloria !
very good ! two cookies for you !
thank you !
uh , yeah , but she needs a pedicure .
look at that .
you knocked me down !
i did not .
yes , you did , too !
girls ! girls ! girls ! no need to fight .
i don &apos;t have a favorite .
why the hell not ? !
i am very disappointed in both of you .
family members should treat each other
with love and respect .
except that claire is not part of our family .
cierra la boca !
no . no , no .
she &apos;s right-- unless that &apos;s what you just said .
i can &apos;t tell , &apos; cause i @-@ i only took french ,
and je parle un peu .
oh , you have a beautiful accent .
really ? do you think so ?
ay @-@ ya ! por favor ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i ...
i @-@ i &apos;m jealous .
ay , claire .
but you &apos;re beautiful , too , in your own way .
no . i &apos;m not jealous of you .
i am jealous of how your mother
comes all the way to see you from colombia ,
when my own mother won &apos;t even get on a bus
from the almond co @-@ op she lives on three hours away .
she sends presents , no ?
yeah . it &apos;s the same thing every year .
it &apos;s always slippers .
i am sorry .
thank you .
but i shouldn &apos;t take it out on you
just &apos; cause i have a lousy mom .
don &apos;t disrespect your mother !
is she always like this ?
yes .
did you-- did you ever think maybe there &apos;s a reason
she sends you that gift ?
yeah , &apos; cause she found something
when i was 8 years old that i actually liked ,
and she hasn &apos;t thought about it since .
well , maybe she thinks about it a lot .
maybe she remembers a time when she made you happy ,
and she wants to go back there .
well , now i feel terrible .
the only thing i sent her was an e @-@ card .
we don &apos;t like to admit it ...
but mothers never get over
the day their daughters leave them .
we never stop needing our little girls .
i will never stop needing you , mama .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me , elf ,
it &apos;s been 45 minutes .
where &apos;s santa ?
i don &apos;t know !
maybe he &apos;s a little busy making presents
for every child in the world .
one second !
where is he ?
he said he was going out for a pack of candy canes .
you mean like those ?
okay . wake up ! he is not coming back !
we need to change into our regular clothes
and sneak out .
who am i kidding ?
my eyes are unforgettable .
i couldn &apos;t even hold on to a fake husband .
i always thought you were the tough one to live with ,
but maybe i am .
okay , they &apos;ve breached the jelly bean moat . this is a problem .
it &apos;s a big problem . all this time , i &apos;ve been waiting
for a guy to see the true me ,
and now i &apos;m scared he will .
oh , my god ! they &apos;ve got blitzen !
what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
am i just going to nitpick everyone until they leave me ?
hey , mom found somebody !
that &apos;s true .
okay , listen .
we really need to get out of here .
but i just want to let you know
that you weren &apos;t all bad to live with .
i thought--
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
where &apos;s santa ? !
only 100 more yards .
you &apos;re just about there !
can you see it ?
it &apos;s so beautiful . it &apos;s so green .
and , wow , those are high up there .
the mountains ?
no , my shorts again .
would you mind giving them one last tug ?
you &apos;re crossing the border .
yeah , i know , and i feel bad asking ,
but i &apos;m tasting cotton .
no ! you did it ! you &apos;re in canada !
wait . what ?
i did it ? i did it !
i did it ! i did it !
let &apos;s go tell mom !
wait .
how did i used to walk ?
all right . come on , sweetie .
let &apos;s go .
uh , we &apos;re serving christmas dinner .
uh , no . that &apos;s fine .
we have to actually get going , so ...
but i haven &apos;t eaten today .
oh , you poor thing !
no , she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s fine .
oh , there he is .
honey , where did you get this coat ?
sorry , kids .
it looks like we &apos;ve run out of coats and toys .
that &apos;s okay , mom . at least i got to see presents .
okay . come on . let &apos;s go .
hey ! how are my do @-@ gooders ?
did you have fun ?
yep . talk about it in the car .
oh , my gosh .
what are these ?
yeah , i went a little crazy , huh ?
no ! no , no ! it &apos;s a christmas miracle !
kids ! kids ! who wants presents ?
cam , what are you doing ?
no , trust me . lily has enough .
cam , cam .
everybody , merry christmas !
oh ! not that one .
feliz navidad !
okay , but those aren &apos;t for lily .
&quot; his @-@ and @-@ his shower clogs ? &quot;
they &apos;re for pepper &apos;s party .
he said , &quot; no gifts , please . &quot;
imagine how pepper would say that .
what &apos;s a himalayan salt plate ?
you can season your food while you serve it . yeah .
body @-@ fat scale ?
i wish i would &apos;ve had one of those when i was your age .
you &apos;re welcome .
who &apos;s robert mapplethorp ?
actually , i &apos;m gonna need that one back .
sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
all i really wanted this year was a puppy pound .
here . you can have mine .
it &apos;s really fun .
oh , my gosh .
that &apos;s the sweetest thing i &apos;ve ever seen !
lily , honey , that was so nice !
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll get one tomorrow .
um , well , you know what ? about that --
cam ? cam ?
uh , that was a t @-@ o @-@ y s @-@ t @-@ o @-@ r @-@ e .
what ?
someone returned their puppy pound .
w @-@ we can &apos;t get over there in time before the store closes !
wait , you know who lives right over there ?
oh , no . no !
almost there .
no .
no ! why ? !
why @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y @-@ y ? !
in hindsight , the cigar was a mistake .
so , what do we do now ?
we go home .
i thought pritchetts never give up .
they know when to give up ,
which is its own kind of victory .
unless ...
what ?
no it &apos;s crazy .
unless ...
are you really gonna make me ask you again ?
... we somehow apply pressure to the axhead already in the tree .
i bet we can use the jack from the car .
of course . the upward motion will split the trunk . yeah .
we can always tell people that &apos;s how we did it .
that is how we did it .
people love getting new things ...
but the best stuff has a story behind it .
damn fine tree .
except the saw &apos;s still stuck in the truck .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna want to keep your brother away from that , huh ?
a lot of times , it &apos;s only after we get rid of something ...
room for me ?
... that we realize how much we miss it .
oh ! nice !
good job , luke !
yay ! a puppy pound !
and things that seem worthless
suddenly turn out to be super valuable ...
okay , everybody , picture in front of the tree .
timer &apos;s set . ready ?
what ? no !
... maybe even precious ...
which is why i thought getting rid of this stuff
would be a huge mistake .
nice try .
you still owe us six weeks &apos; allowance ,
and the fireworks .
how could you screw this up ?
what ?
i &apos;ll see you in vancouver , eh ?
no . luke , do the accent again ?
oh , are you on that machine ?
yes , juliana , but unlike your husband ,
i &apos;ll be finished before you know it .
you know what ? it &apos;s actually easier this way !
wonder if you could patent a movement ?
call it &quot; fliptical &quot; --
dad , trick or treaters !
we &apos;re out of candy !
who is this dad ?
i &apos;m gandalf .
