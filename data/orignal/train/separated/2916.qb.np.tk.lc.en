well , hello there .
hi .
i didn &apos;t see this on the menu .
tim , this is phoebe . phoebe , this is tim , my new sous chef .
so you &apos;re monica &apos;s boss ?
no , she &apos;s my boss .
&quot; sous &quot; is french for &quot; under . &quot;
i &quot; sous @-@ stand . &quot;
tim , i need a calamari and a caesar salad . and could you get me the pesto ?
you made pesto ?
yes , i did .
would you say your pesto is the best @-@ o ?
i don &apos;t know . i would say it &apos;s pretty good @-@ o .
i still need the calamari and salad .
i like your necklace .
&quot; coming up , monica . i have to obey you , otherwise the system breaks down . &quot;
&quot; l know that . &quot; &quot; then why are we having this conversation ? &quot;
i made it myself .
you are so talented .
well , it &apos;s no pesto .
let &apos;s just cut to the chase . you &apos;re single . you &apos;re single .
he gets off work at 11 . she &apos;ll be waiting for your call .
i &apos;ll give him your number if i could just get one calamari and one caesar salad !
i did not yell . i am not putting a dollar in the jar .
the.one.with.rachels.date
wow , bing ! burning the midnight oil .
you know me , sir .
do you know how i can get around the office computer network ..
so i can access the really good internet porn ?
you &apos;re a joker , bing .
what &apos;s funny about that ?
sorry i kept you waiting so long .
that &apos;s okay . where do you wanna go ?
i think you know where i wanna go .
the hard rock cafe ?
yeah .
again ?
yeah .
i &apos;m telling you , i like the food .
you like the purple rain display .
hey , bob .
hey , toby . have a good night .
did that guy just call you toby ?
yeah , he thinks that &apos;s my name .
why don &apos;t you correct him ?
it &apos;s been going on way too long now .
the first time , we were just passing each other , so i didn &apos;t say anything .
the next time he said , &quot; toby , want a doughnut ? &quot;
i wanted the doughnut .
five years later , the doughnut &apos;s gone and i &apos;m still toby .
chandler , you have to tell him .
that would be so awkward .
we don &apos;t work together . he &apos;s on the sixth floor .
so he calls me toby once in a while .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s calling me muriel .
muriel . why would he call you muriel ?
oh , my god .
chandler &quot; m. &quot; bing .
it &apos;s not just an &quot; m. &quot; your middle name is muriel !
it is a family name .
chandler muriel bing .
your parents never even gave you a chance , did they ?
drake , i &apos;ve discovered the reason for your memory loss .
what is it ?
your brain transplant wasn &apos;t successful .
your body &apos;s rejecting jessica &apos;s brain .
is it serious ?
not if we extract tissue from the original body ..
and synthesize antibodies to stop you from rejecting the brain .
that sounds simple enough . let &apos;s just do that .
we would , but when we went to exhume jessica &apos;s body ..
it was gone .
very nice , people .
i &apos;ll change and we can go .
what happened to jessica &apos;s body ?
you &apos;ll have to see it on tv .
you don &apos;t know , do you ?
couldn &apos;t care less .
good scene , man .
you too .
what ? you weren &apos;t in it .
kash , this is my friend rachel . rachel , kash .
hi .
why haven &apos;t i seen you here before ?
joey just thinks i &apos;ll embarrass him . he thinks i &apos;m a soap opera nut .
which i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not .
although , i do know your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan .
and your dog &apos;s name is wally .
look , i &apos;m just stroking your arm .
here we go .
bye , kash . say hi to wally .
monica .
hi .
i had the best time with tim last night . he is so sweet .
i can &apos;t wait to get &quot; sous @-@ neath &quot; him .
i have to fire him .
why ?
he &apos;s terrible . he &apos;s slow . he burns things .
he lit my pastry chef on fire .
he was nervous . you can be intimidating .
and your pastry chef can stand to be taken down a peg .
well , now she has no eyebrows . mission accomplished .
but , monica , he loves his job so much .
can &apos;t you just give him another chance , please ?
all right . but if he lights someone else on fire , he &apos;s gone .
that &apos;s fair . thank you so much .
looks like he got you a little bit too .
i paid to have this done .
love it !
hey . you know , kash really liked you .
he thought you were charming .
i thought i was an idiot .
i &apos;m with you .
he asked if you &apos;d go out with him .
i think i &apos;m gonna throw up a little .
what did you say ?
&quot; no . &quot;
what ?
i figured since you &apos;re pregnant , you &apos;re not gonna be seeing people .
first of all , kash ford ? not people .
did you tell him i was pregnant ?
no . i didn &apos;t know if you told people . this was when kash was still &quot; people . &quot;
good . just have him call me .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s ..
go do it or i &apos;ll come back to that set . i &apos;ll meet more actors .
hey , bob .
how &apos;s my pal toby doing today ?
if i see him , i &apos;ll ask .
was that bob from six you were just talking to ?
yeah .
you know him ?
we &apos;re on a semi @-@ first @-@ name basis .
what about adding him to our team ?
bob ?
working here with us ? every day ? i don &apos;t know if he has what it takes .
they love him down on six .
but this is 11 .
it &apos;s almost twice as hard up here .
okay , bob will stay put .
i think it &apos;s best , sir .
we do need to find somebody . work is starting to pile up .
i &apos;ve got a stack of documents this high .
just toss them in the shredder and claim you never got them .
that &apos;s a good one , bing .
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here ?
i gave him another chance , but tim has got to go .
i called the chef who recommended him to me .
he said , &quot; ha , ha ! gotcha ! &quot;
but don &apos;t fire him today .
why ?
because i &apos;m dumping him today .
you said he was sweet .
he &apos;s too sweet . he calls me all the time .
&quot; did you get home okay ? was your shower okay ? &quot;
don &apos;t pick up the phone .
then he comes over !
&quot; i was so worried about you . &quot; be a man !
so i can &apos;t fire him ?
and dump him the same day ? he &apos;ll kill himself .
i &apos;ll fire him , and you go out with him another week .
are you kidding ? another week with that simp , i &apos;ll kill myself .
we &apos;ll both do it today and he &apos;ll just have to deal with it .
okay . but who &apos;s gonna go first ? whoever goes second is the bitch .
what ?
fire a guy that &apos;s just been dumped ?
bitch ! and dump a guy that &apos;s just been fired ?
blond bitch !
i wanted to do this days ago , so i think i should go first .
all right , that makes sense .
but screw you ! i &apos;m going first !
toby , you got a sec ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
i wanted to get transferred up here , but it &apos;s not gonna happen .
apparently somebody thinks i &apos;m not &quot; 11th @-@ floor material . &quot;
say , who the hell is this chandler ?
what &apos;s the best excuse for why i &apos;m not drinking on this date tonight ?
&quot; i &apos;m a recovering alcoholic , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a mormon .. &quot;
or &quot; i got so hammered last night i &apos;m still a little drunk &quot; ?
you &apos;re not gonna tell him you &apos;re pregnant ?
i don &apos;t think so . books say wait till the third date to tell the guy ..
you got something growing in your uterus .
hey .
hi .
what do you want to do tonight ?
there &apos;s a powerful ukrainian film playing . interested ?
no . but i &apos;ll go see a normal @-@ person movie with you .
rach , you wanna come ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve got a date .
a date ?
yeah . why , is that weird for you ?
why , no . it &apos;s the opposite of weird . it &apos;s regular .
it &apos;s mundane . it &apos;s actually a little dull .
it &apos;s no ukrainian film .
earrings !
she &apos;s got a date ? with who ?
i set her up with this actor .
you set her up ?
no .
what were you thinking ?
that it was okay ..
because you two haven &apos;t dated in five years .
i &apos;m worried about my baby . whoever she dates , my baby dates .
where is this &quot; actor &quot; taking them ?
hey ! i &apos;m an &quot; actor &quot; too .
they &apos;re taking the ferry to a place on staten lsland .
my baby &apos;s going on a ferry ? do you have any idea how dangerous those are ?
aren &apos;t we talking about those big boats that go really slow ?
why not just jump out of an airplane or burn each other with matches ?
hey , joey .
hey , kash . ross , this is kash .
hey , i hear you &apos;re going on a ferry tonight .
bit of a daredevil , are we ?
do you guys think this is too slutty ? hi , kash .
hey , rachel . you ready to go ?
yeah . see you guys later .
have a great time , you guys . and yes , it is too slutty !
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m glad you called . i feel like i &apos;m always calling you .
what &apos;s up ? is everything okay with phoebe ?
it will be in a minute .
tim , you &apos;re a really great guy .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m with you .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;m in a place in my life right now where ..
so sorry . &quot; this just in . &quot;
it &apos;s the restaurant . monica needs me right away .
no , she doesn &apos;t ! i know what that is . you can stay .
i &apos;ll miss you too , pheebs .
and i will be holding you right here .
what movie do you wanna see ? and not one i have to read .
i get that from books .
books ?
okay , car magazines , cereal boxes ..
but it &apos;s enough !
let &apos;s not see a movie . we &apos;ll just stay here and hang .
just wait for rachel to come back ?
hey , if that &apos;s what you wanna do .
dude , what is going on ?
i have to find out how it went .
why ?
he could be my baby &apos;s stepfather .
one date and they &apos;re getting married ?
he &apos;s not you !
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s dating !
what did you think she was gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
what do you mean ?
i thought when i had another kid , it &apos;d be different .
i love ben . but every time i drop him off at carol and susan &apos;s ..
it breaks my heart a little .
i &apos;ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed ..
my kid comes running in , leaps up on the bed and we all read the paper .
maybe fight over the science section .
that &apos;s nice . you can still have that .
no . rachel &apos;s out with some guy .
my baby went with her .
if anything , that picture keeps moving further away .
hey , can i ask you something ?
in this picture of you and your wife , is your wife rachel ?
it used to be .
now she doesn &apos;t really have a face .
smokin &apos; body , though .
good call . but the face , ross , the face isn &apos;t rachel .
no . but how much easier would it be if it were ?
that &apos;s not what she wants .
i know . and i can &apos;t force myself to fall in love with her .
ross , maybe you need a new picture .
it won &apos;t be what you thought . but no matter what ..
there &apos;s gonna be a brand @-@ new little baby . your baby .
who cares what the picture looks like ?
yeah .
let &apos;s you and me go out and have some fun .
whatever you want . come on .
we can catch that ukrainian film .
no , i said fun .
hey , toby ?
hey , bobby .
it &apos;s bob , actually .
you work up here . where &apos;s chandler bing &apos;s office ?
yeah , it &apos;s right ..
right there . let me ask you , why ?
i wanna talk to that bastard , see what his problem is .
okay , bob . listen .
i &apos;m the reason you didn &apos;t get the job .
toby , don &apos;t .
bob .
toby , i &apos;m not gonna let you cover for him .
anything you say will just get me more upset with chandler .
that puts me in a difficult position .
you do anything to chandler , it &apos;s gonna bring you down to his level .
i guess you &apos;re right .
don &apos;t give him the satisfaction . you &apos;re better than chandler . we all are .
especially me , toby .
is everything okay ?
that depends .
how are you and phoebe ?
great . thanks for introducing us .
my pleasure . okay , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got some bad news .
phoebe !
monica !
you &apos;re fired !
i &apos;m breaking up with you !
i &apos;m breaking up with you .
you &apos;re fired .
why ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not ready for a relationship right now .
i &apos;m sorry too . but i like things done a certain way .
the chemistry &apos;s just not right .
the chemistry thing for us too .
wow . okay .
i realize i came on a little strong . it &apos;s because i think you &apos;re amazing .
i wanna tell you how much i appreciate you giving me an opportunity .
you &apos;re the most talented chef i &apos;ve ever worked for .
anyway ..
tim , wait .
yeah ?
i spoke too quickly . there &apos;s a learning curve with this job .
maybe we could try it again .
thank you so much . i know i can be better .
and , tim , i just want to say good luck here .
hello .
hi .
how was the date ?
i &apos;m alone and i just bought $ 15 worth of candy bars . what do you think ?
what happened ?
i told him i was pregnant .
he didn &apos;t take it so well ?
well , better than you .
but still not what you want .
oh ?
yeah . he got all weird and sputtery . then he said :
&quot; i hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch . &quot;
he sounds swell .
doesn &apos;t he ?
you want a little cheering up ? sit down .
guess whose middle name is muriel .
chandler m. bing . oh , my god .
i &apos;m sorry about your date .

just one more thing in my life that &apos;s completely different .
this is hard .
yeah , i know .
on the other hand , in seven months you &apos;re gonna have something ..
that you &apos;re gonna love more than any guy you &apos;ve ever gone out with .
just wait .

you have no idea .
