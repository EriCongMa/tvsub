this movie baffles me every time we watch it .
what do you mean ?
the instructions are very clear :
&quot; don &apos;t feed the gremlins after midnight . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get the gremlins wet . &quot;
how hard is that ?
hi , guys .
hi , honey .
hey .
ooh , we &apos;re &quot; honey &quot; now , are we ?
yes . since their relationship become carnal ,
penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment ,
thus distinguishing him from those she calls &quot; sweetie , &quot;
usually in an attempt to soften a thinly @-@ veiled insult .
you &apos;re boring people , &quot; sweetie . &quot;
although , sometimes , she omits the veil entirely .
so , what are you guys doing ?
celebrating columbus day .
we &apos;re watching goonies , gremlins and young sherlock holmes .
they &apos;re all written by chris columbus .
okay .
what do you watch on thanksgiving ?
the parade .
oh , you know , that reminds me--
i usually go back to nebraska for thanksgiving ,
but this year they &apos;re calling it off ,
on account of my brother &apos;s trial .
what &apos;s he on trial for ?
oh , just a big misunderstanding .
you know , you &apos;d actually like my brother .
he &apos;s kind of a chemist .
anyway , i was thinking i &apos;d have thanksgiving here ,
and you are all invited .
oh . i &apos;ll be there .
will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce ?
i guess i could serve both .
you guess ? you don &apos;t seem to have much of a handle on this .
yeah , i really wish i could , penny , but every year ,
my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up
her famous tur @-@ briska @-@ fil .
tur @-@ briska @-@ fil ?
turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish .
it &apos;s not as good as it sounds .
raj , what about you ?
oh , he usually comes to my house . right , pal ?
all right , this year , you don &apos;t have to
eat the tur @-@ briska @-@ fil .
i don &apos;t even chew it .
i swallow it like pills .
so , what &apos;s going on with raj ?
well , the good news is ,
he has no problem with my mother &apos;s tur @-@ brka @-@ fil .
hard to believe , but go on .
the bad news is , he says he &apos;getting deported .
what do you mean ,
he &apos;s getting deported ?
i believe it means that the u.s. government
is going to expel him from the country .
he could then either return to his native india ,
emigrate to another country that &apos;s willing to accept him ,
or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate .
personally , i &apos;d choose pirate .
penny , would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him ?
fine .
but the man really needs to work on his girl issues .
another reason to consider life of piracy .
even today , i unrstand that &apos;s an all @-@ male profession .
okay , she &apos;s go .
sorry . i lost my cool .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
okay , here &apos;s the deal :
six months ago , my research testing
the predicted composition of trans @-@ neptunian objects
ran into a dead end .
so ?
so , my visa &apos;s only good as long as i employ to the university .
and when they find out that i &apos;ve got squat ,
they &apos;re going to cut me off .
by the way , when i say squat , i mean diddly @-@ squat .
i wish i had squat .
so , wait , what have you been doing for the past six months ?
you know , checking e @-@ mail ,
updating my facebook status ,
messing up wikipedia entries .
hey , do you know netflix
lets you stream movies on your computer now ?
and you &apos;ve continued to take the university &apos;s money
under false pretenses ?
highly unethical for an astrophysicist .
although practically mandatory for a pirate .
i don &apos;t want to go back to india .
it &apos;s hot and loud , and there &apos;s so many people .
you have no idea-- they &apos;re everywhere .
okay , guys , think .
how do we keep raj in the country ?
why doesn &apos;t he just get another job ?
what are you asking me for ?
i don &apos;t know if you can talk now or not .
oh , beef ...
i &apos;m going to miss you so much .
do you know , at the mumbai mcdonald &apos;s ,
you can &apos;t get a big mac ?
all you can get is a chicken maharaja mac .
and the special sauce--
curry-- which , in india , believe you me ,
is really not that special .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll find another job .
yeah , let me start practicing for it .
&quot; do you want fries with maharaja mac ? &quot;
hi , leonard .
hello , raj .
hello , sheldon .
forgive me , as you know , i &apos;m no adept at reading facial cues ,
but i &apos;m going to take a stab here :
you &apos;re either sad or nauseated .
i &apos;m sad .
i was going to say sad .
i don &apos;t know why i hedged .
what are you eating ?
elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce .
oh , beefaroni .
i think i &apos;ll miss you most of all .
i &apos;ve always been a little confused about this .
why don &apos;t hindus eat beef ?
we believe cows are gods .
not technically .
in hinduism , cattle are thought to be like god .
do not tell me about my own culture , sheldon !
in the mood i &apos;m in , i &apos;ll take you out--
i swear to cow !
i &apos;m sorry .
me , too .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m a little on edge .
understandle .
your entire life seems to be crumbling around you ,
and your future appears bleak at best .
thank you .
and you &apos;re wrong about hinduism and cows .
hey , raj , guess what .
professor laughlin is looking for someone to join
the stellar evolution research team .
you @-@ you &apos;re kidding ! that &apos;s fantastic !
what are you waiting for ? call him and set up an interview .
i &apos;m on it .
that &apos;s happy , right ?
yeah .
nailed it .
dr. koothrappali , come on in .
i was surprised to hear you were interested
in joining our little team .
giving up on those trans @-@ neptunian objects , are we ?
no , no , it &apos;s a very promising area .
in a perfect world , i &apos;d spend several more years on it .
but i just couldn &apos;t pass up the opportunity
to work with you on your tremendously exciting
and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis .
splendid .
uh , please sit down .
can i offer you a sherry ?
it &apos;s a little early , isn &apos;t it ?
not on proxima centauri .
that &apos;s very good .
jolly amusing , but if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;ll hold off until suet on titan .
well done .
i have a feeling you &apos;re going
to fit in just fine , dr. koothrappali .
thank you , sir .
i &apos;m sorry .
am i late ?
no , no , no . right on time .
dr. koothrappali , may i present
dr. millstone from mit .
she &apos;ll be heading up our data analysis team .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , dr. koothrappali .
i read your paper on kuiper belt object size distribution .
i really enjoy it .
how did you correct for the selection bias ?
well , i ran a simulation that allowed me
to correct for the observational efficiency .
that &apos;s just fascinating .
thank you .
would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub ?
so , when do i start ?
what do you mean you didn &apos;t get the job ?
how could you not get it ?
u know ... he &apos;s british ; i &apos;m indian .
ever since gandhi , they haven &apos;t liked us very much .
wait , are you saying that he discriminated against you ?
because we should file a complaint .
that &apos;s okay .
a complaint &apos;s been filed .
so , that &apos;s it .
that was my last hope .
i &apos;m going to be deported ,
sent home in disgrace ,
exposed to the sardonic barb of my cousin sanjay .
or , as you may know him ,
dave from at &amp; t customer service .
i &apos;m really going to miss you .
will you come visit me india ?
gee , that &apos;s , like , a 17 @-@ hour flight .
how about i meet you halfway ?
halfway is 600 miles off the coast of japan .
tell you what , we &apos;ll skype .
gentlemen .
hey .
raj ,
did you get a job with professor laughlin ?
no .
i assumed as much .
but never fear .
like the subordinate male protagonist
in countless action movies
who disappears half way through the second reel ,
i have returned to save the day .
odd .
usually , he &apos;s met by cheers .
anyway , i was thinking about exploring
the string theory implications
of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations ,
and it occurred to me that i could benefit--
excuse me , sheldon .
how many reels before the subordine male protagonist
gets to s point ?
i &apos;m sorry-- if you didn &apos;t cheer at my entrance ,
it &apos;s too late to buy into the premise .
anyway , i got some extra money
from the head of the department ,
and raj can come work for me .
you want me to work with you ?
for me .
you &apos;re going to have to listen
more careful when you &apos;re on the job .
ay , uh , please don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but i &apos;d rather swim buck @-@ naked across the ganges
with a paper cut on my nipple
and die a slow , agonizing death
from a viral infection than work with you .
for me .
sheldon , are you busy ?
of course i &apos;m busy .
shall i wait ?
yes , please
how may i help you ?
i &apos;ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you .
for me
yes , for you .
i do , however , have a few conditions .
first , at all times ,
i am to be treated as a colleague and an equal .
second , my contributions shall noted
in all published material .
and third , you are never allowed to lecture me
on hinduism or my indian culture .
i &apos;m impressed , raj .
those are very cogent and reasonable conditions .
thank you .
i reject them all .
then you leave me no choice .
i accept the job .
i &apos;m sorry , i believe you &apos;ve misunderstood .
i &apos;m not giving you the job .
i &apos;m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it .
have a seat ; we &apos;ll get started with the interview .
wha ... you &apos;re kidding !
please .
all right .
so ...
that &apos;s what you wear to an interview ?
come on , dude , we &apos;ve been friends for years .
oh , pulling strings , are we ?
sheldon , for god &apos;s sakes , don &apos;t make me beg .
bazinga !
you &apos;ve fallen victim
to another one of my classic practical jokes .
i &apos;m your boss now . you may want to laugh at that .
ah , this is nice having the place to ourselves , isn &apos;t it ?
uh @-@ huh .
now that raj is working for sheldon ,
i don &apos;t have to chauffeur him around anymore .
plus , yeah , with them working late so much ,
we get some privacy .
mm @-@ hmm .
hey , want to get a little crazy ?
what are you thinking ?
let &apos;s slide over to sheldon &apos;s spot and make out .
you are a dirty girl .
oh , god , how did he know ?
hello .
hi , howard .
am i interrupting ?
little bit , yeah .
guess i should have called .
yeah , maybe .
tonight &apos;s the night i usually go line dancing
with raj at the palomino .
uh @-@ huh .
but he &apos;s working with sheldon .
yes , we know .
want me to leave ?
you know , whatever .
okay , i guess i can hang for a little while .
so what are we watching ?
sex and the city . yikes .
hey , i happen to love this mie .
fine , let &apos;s watch it .
maybe all our periods will synchronize .
all right , we &apos;re going to be designing an experiment
to look for the annihilation spectrum
resulting from dark matter collisions in space .
ooh , dark matter .
we better bring a flashlight .
i was making a joke .
i &apos;m the boss .
i make the jokes .
sorry go ahead and make your joke .
this is not the time for joking .
we &apos;re doing serious research ,
which requires complete and utter focus .
all right , let &apos;s buckle down and work .
( &quot; eye of the tiger &quot; by survivor playing )
sheldon .
what ?
i need an aspirin .
top desk drawer .
thank you .
alright ?
yes .
good .
that was fun .
thank you .
leonard , honey , you don &apos;t have to say thank you
every time we have sex .
oh . okay .
tomorrow you &apos;re going to get a card in the mail .
just throw it away .
top o &apos; the mornin &apos;o ya !
what are you doing here ?
well , usually , on sundays , i go with raj
to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market ,
but he &apos;s still working with sheldon ,
so i thought i &apos;d come over here
and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami .
it &apos;s the perfect meal for apres l &apos;amour .
oh , kill me .
by the way , i couldn &apos;t help overhearing your big finish .
bravo , leonard .
see , if you had killed me when i said &quot; kill me , &quot;
i wouldn &apos;t have had to hear that .
what do you guys think ?
wanna take in a matinee ,
maybe go rollerblading ,
catch a step class ?
do something .
okay .
um , howard , we need talk .
sure. wats up , holmes ?
uh ... please understand
that it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t want you around ,
but penny and i occasionally need some ...
alone time .
i @-@ i get it , i &apos;m the third wheel .
sorry , i should have seen that .
i &apos;ll get out of your way .
you &apos;re gonna want to eat those eggs while they &apos;re still hot .
thank you .
there &apos;s lox and cream cheese in the fridge .
the bagels are in the oven.i was warming them up .
that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m just going to hang out with my mother.that &apos;s always fun .
good .
are we terrible people ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you want me to do ?
g @-@ get him ; bring him back .
are you sure ?
yeah .
okay .
howard come back .
oh , you guys had me scared for a minute .
no , no , no , no !
that rate is much too low from what we &apos;d expect from this collision .
do you understand
we &apos;re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space ?
of course i understand .
and who are you to tell me about outer space ?
i &apos;m the astrophysicist .
&quot; astro &quot; means &quot; space &quot;
&quot; astro &quot; means &quot; star &quot;
okay , well , let me just tell you ,
if we having this argument in my native language
i &apos;d be kicking your butt .
english is your native language .
okay , you got me there , but you &apos;re wrong about this !
there is a fine line between wrong and visionary .
unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it .
my god , you think that every thought
that comes out of your head is pure gold .
well , let me tell you something .
some of those thoughts are pure caca .
caca
it means &quot; doo @-@ doo . &quot;
all right !
first of all , dr. koothrappali ,
when i first proposed that you work with me ..
aha ! so i am working with you .
in this context , &quot; with me &quot; means for me . &quot;
ah , well , in this context ...
if i &apos;m wrong , prove it .
okay .
here &apos;s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle .
no , no , no .
you &apos;ve misstated the atomic weight of the target .
let me finish .
you &apos;re defacing my work .
i &apos;m not defacing it , i &apos;m fixing it .
give me the eraser .
no .
i said give it to me .
come and get it .
fine .
oh , lord .
dr. koothrappali ,
as your superior , i forbid you from writing on my board !
you are not my superior .
i am in every way .
oh , yeah ?
can you do this ?
nice working with you .
i &apos;m sorry-- for you .
raj ...
raj ... raj ...
i &apos;m busy .
doing what ?
all right , you &apos;ve made your point .
what do you want , sheldon ?
i looked over the board
and it turns out you were right .
so you were wrong .
i didn &apos;t say that .
that &apos;s the only logical inference .
nevertheless , i didn &apos;t say it .
anyway , i would like you to come back and work for me .
for you or with you ?
in this coext &quot; for me &quot; could mean &quot; with me . &quot;
all right , but i have some conditions .
i reject them all .
i &apos;ll take the job .
see you monday .
wait , you have to drive me home .
how did you get here ?
i walked .
so walk home .
i can &apos;t .
there &apos;s a big dog outside ...
on the way home , we can start thinking
about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 gev particles
