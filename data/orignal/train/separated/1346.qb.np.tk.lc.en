um ... it &apos;s cold .
okay .
it &apos;s dirty .
yeah .

is that it ? that &apos;s so boring .
now , that i like .
that was unexpected . i like it . that &apos;s good .
come on ! whoo !
whoa , that &apos;s cold ! whoo !
come on ! yeah , the water &apos;s fine !
cathy ! come on ! take a picture !
the water &apos;s fine !
cathy ? cathy ?
oh , my god !
cathy , what is it ?
what is it ? what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on ? hey ! what &apos;s going on ?
look !
you need a theme .
i &apos;ve got a theme .
what ?
booze .
people can drink at home . you need to ... amp up the fun .
yeah , like , great music can do that .
yeah , get a jukebox .
i got a jukebox in the back . it &apos;s busted , though .
i &apos;m gonna get it fixed .
it &apos;s got every tune ever done by tiffany on it .
that explains why it &apos;s busted .
you need a theme .
for a jukebox ?
yeah , maura &apos;s right .
and -- and you know what ? you should switch it up .
like , one week , do &apos; 80s hair bands .
and the next week , do southern rock .
you know , i think a little consistency would be better .
like , all josh groban all the time .
i like it . that way , the bar would be consistently empty .
we would always have seats .
the bar will be full . i &apos;m working on live music .
and you will always have seats .
detective kors-- um , uh ...
dirty robber . this is vince .
angela , what do you think the place needs ?
yeah , ma , you &apos;re unusually quiet .
i &apos;m thinking .
paging dr. isles .
no , this is a job for two , dr. rizzoli .
what &apos;s up , mom ?
nothing .
résumés ? this about the job hunt ?
job hunt . how is it going ?
it &apos;s not .
nobody wants to hire a woman of a certain age .
they want to hire a 22 @-@ year @-@ old .
well , statistically speaking , that &apos;s not true .
although some jobs do require more youthful employees ,
i think if you just expand your universe to just --
really ? statistics now ?
there &apos;s comfort in numbers .
not for me .
résumés sent out -- 37 .
job interviews -- one .
jobs gotten -- zippo .
rizzoli .
isles .
korsak .
hey , i got to call you back .
yeah . we &apos;ll be right there .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . ma .
yeah , okay , forget it .
we &apos;ll talk about it later ?
okay , go . go solve crimes .
i &apos;m staying here .
hey , vince .
gonna stay and hang some of your posters , okay ?
oh , that &apos;s very nice of you , angela . thanks .
yeah , i &apos;m very generous .
i &apos;m also eating for free .
excuse me . i &apos;m looking for mr. korsak .
i &apos;m here about the job .
oh , you &apos;ll just have to leave your résumés .
we &apos;re gonna have to reschedule . i &apos;m sorry .
you got any experience ?
not really . i &apos;m just 22 .
you &apos;ll be fine .
well , this is a first .
i &apos;ve seen it once .
is there anything that you haven &apos;t seen once before ?
you cutting me slack .
come on , tell us .
oh , guy fell off a sailboat . probably drunk .
probably urinating .
when a man stands up to urinate , his center of gravity is high
but the lifeline to the sailboat deck is low ,
so without a hand to steady himself --
got it . y-- back to your guy .
yeah , drunk , fell off a boat ,
died of a heart attack in the water .
both feet washed up in a couple of days .
never found the rest of him .
so ... his feet were detachable ?
well , everyone &apos;s are -- kind of .
the tendons connecting the foot to the leg are thin ,
so they dissolve and break away in the seawater .
another reason i hate the ocean .
what are the other reasons ?
it &apos;s full of drunk guys peeing in it --
i think that &apos;s enough .
well , the buoyancy of the running shoe
caused the detachable foot to rise to the surface .
the current would wash it right to this beach .
so there could be a body on its way .
yep . got guys in the harbor searching .
they may find it first .
maura , can you even tell us anything from just a foot ?
i &apos;ll be able to tell how the foot was separated .
big fish could do that . - you &apos;ve seen that -- once .
i didn &apos;t say once .
and once i examine the bones ,
i &apos;ll be able to check for damage from the impact of a jump .
yeah , we &apos;ll have nina check surveillance cameras on bridges .
yeah , we &apos;ll also check missing persons ,
see if somebody went out for a jog and didn &apos;t come back .
call us if you find anything .
all right .
detective rizzoli .
tell us about the serial murderer
dumping body parts into boston harbor .
who tipped them off ?
looks like they got the same call we did .
what do you got , doc ?
well , based on the condition of the tissue ,
the foot was in the water for less than 24 hours .
what about impact damage ?
none . this wasn &apos;t a jumper . it was sawed off .
looks like somebody &apos;s doing a thorough body disposal .
anything else ?
well , the sneaker is a specialty brand
used by serious runners -- it has a zero drop .
wait , wait , wait . you &apos;re losing me .
a zero @-@ millimeter differential in height from heel to toe ,
which provides a wider range of motion ,
strengthening the foot , forcing it to work harder .
forcing it to work harder ?
i &apos;ll never buy these .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , the wear pattern .
there &apos;s more of it on the outside . supination .
the user rolled along the outside of the foot .
maybe you can give a description of the shoe
to other precincts .
so if we find other shoes ,
we can compare the wear patterns .
yeah .
well , we &apos;ve gone over all the accident reports .
so far , no people -- or feet --
have been reported missing .
i &apos;ll keep looking here .
i &apos;ll keep looking everywhere else .
are we playing video operation ?
these are body parts that have washed up on beaches
in the northeast over the last 10 years .
uh , jane doesn &apos;t like the ocean .
well , that &apos;s not why , but i &apos;ll add it to the list .
i like the ocean , but don &apos;t get me started on lakes .
why ? lakes are great .
there &apos;s no current .
have you ever seen what settles on the bottom ?
great . now you &apos;ve ruined lakes .
nina , is there any connection
between these body parts and our foot ?
not yet . but take a look at this .
since 2007 , 11 different feet have washed up in canada
on the shores of british colombia .
no one knows why .
so they don &apos;t have anything . eh , we don &apos;t have anything .
we &apos;ve got a little more than that --
another body part washed up .
a foot ?
a torso .
you &apos;re gonna need more screens .
thanks , mr. pompilio .
uh , can you get his contact information ?
anything from the fisherman ?
yeah , he &apos;s a local .
comes down once a month . casts off the pier .
and he saw the torso wash up ,
but he didn &apos;t see where it came from .
it &apos;s illegal to cast off the pier .
he caught us a torso . maybe we &apos;ll let it slide .
similar saw markings to the ones on the foot .
can you tell if it &apos;s the same saw ?
no , the blade markings won &apos;t be that specific ,
but this is a rough cut made with a ripping blade .
definitely a murder .
yeah , we just ... don &apos;t know why or of who .
detectives , is this the work of a serial killer ?
we &apos;re just opening the investigation .
somebody tipped them off again ?
we know one thing &apos;s for sure .
come on .
we got a leak in the department .
that &apos;s what posters are for .
i need your jane hancock .
whoa . i don &apos;t actually work here .
i don &apos;t love you , louis .
i don &apos;t , do not , love @-@ o , no @-@ o .
goodbye , louis .
okay , i &apos;ll sign .
louis ?
yeah .
well , he &apos;s a little obsessive .
that &apos;s what makes him so good at his job .
he never misses a detail . his bosses love him .
do you love him ?
of course i love him . he &apos;s fantastic .
he wants us to move in together .
son of a bitch .
and you don &apos;t want to ?
no .
because you &apos;re worried he &apos;ll ... find out who you really are
and see all your flaws ?
yeah .
don &apos;t you think he &apos;s a little afraid , too ?
louis ? no . mnh @-@ mnh , no . he &apos;s perfect .
louis is a man ?
yeah , well , then he &apos;s not perfect .
no !
what &apos;s your problem , louis ? back off .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk to you right now .
angela .
yeah , well , don &apos;t call back until ...
margaret .
... till margaret calls you .
how did he take it ?
yeah , not so good .
he was still talking .
i know !
he never listens .
yeah , well , i bet you he listens when he gets his way .
perfectly .
how is he with the laundry ?
&quot; que es laundry ? &quot;
yes ! remember these ?
yeah . the thing . volkswagen made them .
you could take the top off , take the doors off ,
make it different shapes .
ah , so cool .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s uncool -- it &apos;s in my spot .
all right .
oh , it belongs to chip .
the forensic artist ?
well , if he gets assigned parking ,
i need to call the union .
i would so hate to be chip right now .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s gonna get an earful .
yeah , you should tell chip
to watch where he parks his thing or he &apos;s gonna lose it .
no , the car . it &apos;s a -- n @-@ never mind .
so , is someone dumping the pieces
one at a time in the harbor
to throw us off time of death ,
or is this some sort of statement ?
well , it could be that the parts were dumped at the same time
and the current is deciding when they wash up .
what do you think about the psychology of a murderer
who cuts people up with a saw ?
well , it could speak to efficiency .
mm . or he was very good in shop class .
this is dr. isles .
i have finished my external examination .
i &apos;m making a &quot; y &quot; incision on the torso .
cutting people up like this , it &apos;s --
it &apos;s such an odd combination
between passionate and ruthless .
it &apos;s , oh , just ...
not you , the murderer .
what ?
do you smell that ?
that wasn &apos;t me .
almonds .
oh . yeah .
get out . now .
i told you it wasn &apos;t me !
jane , it &apos;s cyanide . it smells like almonds .
when do we get our clothes back ?
exposure was brief ,
so decontamination shouldn &apos;t take too long .
jane ?
what ?
it &apos;s just a tickle .
let me see .
what ? stop !
jane , cyanide poisoning
stops the cells of the body from being able to use oxygen .
that didn &apos;t happen , and that thing hurts my eyes ,
as it has the last four times that you &apos;ve used it .
here .
keep hydrating .
it &apos;ll help keep your lungs clear .
i &apos;ll breathe better when we catch &quot; edward sawhands . &quot;
susie ran a tissue sample today ,
and the results just came back .
it confirms that cyanide was the cause of death .
and the time of death was 24 to 30 hours ago .
what about the blade marks ?
it was the same type of blade on both body parts .
it &apos;s a crosscutting blade , commonly found on a sawzall .
which you can get in any hardware store anywhere .
and susie &apos;s gonna test for cyanide in the foot .
okay , i &apos;ll have nina check for large purchases of cyanide .
and in a few hours , the tide comes in .
coming through .
do you mind if i get some more ...
hello ?
hi . excuse me . do you mind if get another cup of c--
okay , so my new superpower is invisibility .
okay . what ?
no , no . i @-@ i @-@ i realize that .
no , look , carlo , i &apos;m gonna get karen a big @-@ ass diamond .
that &apos;s a given . i &apos;m talking about the proposal , okay ?
i want you to film it for me .
can i help you ?
tell me , what &apos;s the plan ?
what ?
to propose to your girlfriend ? what &apos;s the plan ?
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just some lady .
i @-@ i &apos;m on the phone .
hang up . this is important .
why should i ?
because you &apos;re gonna blow this engagement ,
no one is ever gonna love you , you &apos;ll die alone .
i &apos;ll call you back .
all right . tell me .
okay , well , i @-@ i was thinking that i wouldn &apos;t say a word
but i would deliver the ring
in this weird , like , rube goldberg @-@ type device
with all my bros .
uh , no , no , i @-@ it &apos;ll be great . it &apos;ll be like the ok go video .
okay ... no .
drink this .
but i have to go back to work .
they can sell widgets without you .
i need to talk to you about women .
&apos;cause you got a lot to learn .
what &apos;s up ?
oh . you got your clothes back .
yeah , i mean , the scrubs were comfortable .
but every time i got in an elevator ,
someone wanted to tell me about their rash or their headache .
and what would you say ?
&quot; drink some water . get some sleep . &quot;
you &apos;re an excellent doctor .
thank you .
mm . what &apos;s this ?
a titanium rod from the torso .
murder weapon ?
support for a crumpled spine . we &apos;ll get to that .
now , there was cyanide in the torso , but not in the foot .
so the poison killed him too quickly ,
and it got to his heart before his extremities .
excellent supposition .
thank you .
but incorrect .
backsies .
there are no backsies .
well , i had my fingers crossed .
okay .
there were traces of blood in the foot , &quot; o &quot; positive ,
but the blood in the torso was &quot; a. &quot;
so the parts are from different people .
we &apos;ve got two victims .
new paperweight ? thanks .
it &apos;s a titanium rod .
maura extracted it from the torso &apos;s spinal column .
the victim had degenerative spine disease .
there &apos;s a serial number on it .
which nina traced .
it was implanted in a richard o &apos;connell
6 years ago when he was 19 .
local guy ?
yeah . mom and dad are on their way in .
do they know ?
no .
nina found the leak .
i don &apos;t believe it .
i got to take care of this .
go . i &apos;ll talk to the victim &apos;s parents .
thanks .
hi .
did i disturb your journey to another universe ?
actually , it &apos;s a heightened version of our universe .
i call it bostonia . see ? there &apos;s faneuil hall .
it &apos;s a working spacecraft , which i --
i didn &apos;t come here for the comics , chip .
oh . is this about the parking ?
i talked with the angry @-@ bear guy , korsak .
you &apos;ve been leaking information to the press
about active murder investigations ,
which could compromise those investigations .
i haven &apos;t leaked anything .
you sent e @-@ mails from your work computer .
oh , right . yes , i did .
i mentioned some things to my cousin .
he has a local crime blog . he put the word out .
that &apos;s leaking .
no , it &apos;s just talking about work stuff with a blood relative .
this is your defense ?
yeah . so , we good ?
no .
and you are so screwed .
the angry @-@ bear guy accepted my apology .
that was parking . this is leaking .
he was an amazing athlete .
he was a swimmer , broke all the high @-@ school records .
but his back was -- was hurting .
the coach told us that it was the long season ,
so richie rested .
he took advil by the handful ,
stretched , slept on a heating pad .
nothing helped .
it was a horrible summer .
after the first workout of the new season ,
we took him to a specialist at mass general .
he had a serious condition .
spondylolisthesis .
it &apos;s a ... a rare spine disease .
it &apos;s very painful , and there &apos;s no cure .
must have been very difficult for him .
that &apos;s what &apos;s amazing --
he handled the diagnosis with such ... dignity .
he did everything the doctor asked .
and then he had surgery .
the titanium rod in his back ?
it helped his , uh , posture , but not the pain .
he never complained , but it got to him .
we wanted him to have a second surgery but ...
he didn &apos;t want to ?
he stopped listening when he found this --
this healer .
another doctor ?
he called himself a doctor , but he didn &apos;t use medicine .
what did he use ?
i don &apos;t know .
richard got crazy when we asked questions .
he stopped taking his medication ...
and stopped doing the exercises .
and he got worse . much worse .
but he said that we didn &apos;t understand , that we ...
we didn &apos;t have faith .
he thought he would get better ?
he was sure of it .
mr. o &apos;connell , what was the doctor &apos;s name ?
murray . mark murray .
only dr. murray understood .
only dr. murray could get him well .
when was the last time you had contact with your son ?
he hadn &apos;t returned our calls for a month .
so , richard o &apos;connell gets worse ,
but that only makes him believe in this dr. murray more ?
faith is a powerful thing .
so is reality .
what did his surgeon say ?
well , the titanium rod stabilized his spine ,
but he still had a progressive disease .
which would never go away . mnh @-@ mnh .
well , dr. murray promised a cure , gave him hope .
false hope .
well , desperate people take what they can get .
dr. murray &apos;s license had been suspended by the a.m.a.
hmm , can &apos;t wait to meet him .
yeah , i got a bunch of fake problems
he could pretend to help me with .
how long &apos;s murray been renting this place ?
uh , a little over a year and a half .
heck of a place for a doctor &apos;s office .
ooh . well , whoever was manning the desk left in a hurry .
and they took all the people magazines .
check with the phone company .
see when the last phone call was placed .
there &apos;s something you have to see .
come on around . take a look .
just when i thought i couldn &apos;t be less of a fan of this guy ...
at what point do you think richard o &apos;connell
lost faith in his treatment ?
when he realized his doctor was a psychopath .
if he realized .
i talked to the other tenants .
this place is classy .
we got a guy who buys your grandma &apos;s gold jewelry
and melts it down ,
we have an earwax @-@ removal specialist
who uses turkish candles ,
and we have a woman who rescues cats .
is that right upstairs ?
&apos;cause i heard some awful noises .
yeah .
uh , and apparently , she rescues them to keep them .
do they know dr. murray ?
no . he kept odd hours and used the entrance out back .
it &apos;s a perfect place to practice imaginary medicine .
oh , come on .
this is dr. mark murray .
prepare yourself
to experience the healing properties of sound .
one man &apos;s wall of sound
is another man &apos;s medical equipment . ugh !
now i need medical help .
hey , what &apos;s this ?
&quot; tumors , facial . &quot; &quot; tumors , lymphatic . &quot;
&quot; joint pain , mild . &quot;
he &apos;s got a playlist for everything .
i don &apos;t want to hear what went along with that .
detectives , we found dr . murray &apos;s appointment book .
he had a patient coming in -- russ pfeiffer .
mr. pfeiffer , how long were you seeing dr . murray ?
today was my first appointment .
so you didn &apos;t know him ?
no . he was going to treat my rheumatoid arthritis .
is he okay ?
he was gonna treat you how ?
by using sound waves
to create new pathways through my neural system .
mr. pfeiffer , traditional medicine --
my traditional doctor practiced traditional medicine .
he gave me pills -- anti @-@ inflammatories --
for years , until my liver started breaking down .
then pain pills , which worked -- too well .
i lived in fear of becoming addicted to them .
constant pain or fear of addiction--
those were my choices .
how did you hear about dr. murray ?
i was on the way home from the pharmacy with all of my prescriptions
when i saw this man putting up fliers on the bus bench
that said &quot; miraculous healing . &quot;
you can smile . you don &apos;t need a miracle , do you ?
uh , mr. pfeiffer , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to offend you .
i was skeptical , too .
i asked a lot of questions .
the man said he was dr. murray &apos;s assistant ,
and he told me such amazing stories of recovery .
he himself was cured of cancer by dr. murray &apos;s sound waves .
he looked at the big bag of pill bottles i was carrying
and told me he used to have a bag twice the size
and if i saw dr. murray ,
i ... wouldn &apos;t need any pills ever .
and what was his assistant &apos;s name ?
that &apos;s the damndest thing .
i never got his name .
he didn &apos;t give you a card or anything ?
he referred to himself as dr. murray &apos;s assistant .
i never heard him use his own name .
thank you , mr. pfeiffer . you &apos;ve been very helpful .
i can go ?
yeah .
no , let me do it .
mr. pfeiffer ,
give us a call if you remember anything else .
we need to find that assistant .
yeah . that &apos;s the miracle we need .
uh , excuse me .
i &apos;m looking for my waitress from this afternoon .
i didn &apos;t get her name .
was there a problem ?
no . she was awesome .
uh ... i @-@ i brought clint in to meet her--
not , like , for dating .
uh , i &apos;m about to be engaged . he &apos;s pre @-@ engaged .
well , pre @-@ pre @-@ engaged .
hmm . this waitress just gave me some really great advice .
and i need a dose-- a big one .
yeah , i thought i was clueless .
well , you are , but i &apos;m--
was it terry ?
uh ... nope .
evelyn ? short red hair ?
i think she was the bartender .
i mean , she was back there when she told me
i had no idea how to propose to my girlfriend .
and i have even less .
he really does .
uh , she had dark hair , gravely voice ,
pushy , kind of inappropriate .
you &apos;re talking about angela .
okay .
well , she &apos;s not here .
but i &apos;m the owner . i know a lot about proposals .
um ... okay .
seriously . i &apos;ve been married three times .
we should go .
yeah . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s getting late , so ...
thank you .
thank you .
he should talk to angela .
definitely .
blood from both the foot and the torso
were present at the crime scene .
which doesn &apos;t mean they were murdered there .
uh , no , but they were definitely cut up there .
jane . we got to go .
dr. murray was kicked out of the a.m.a. ,
but nina found a bogus license he filed with the city
when he rented his office .
it lists information on the assistant .
his name is bob burke .
well , let &apos;s go talk to him .
that &apos;s why we got to hurry .
an emergency call for bob burke just came in .
and the paramedics are already on their way .
i heard a noise , so i came out on the porch .
i saw mr. burke stumbling out of his apartment .
he fell to his knees , vomited , and passed out .
that &apos;s when i called 911 .
you did the right thing .
i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
um , can i ask him a few questions ?
as long as i can keep working on him .
absolutely .
uh , m @-@ mr. burke ,
i need to ask you a couple questions about dr. murray .
y @-@ you worked for him ?
i idolized him .
he was a visionary .
he was also your doctor ?
he saved my life .
but ... t @-@ then he ...
then what ?
m @-@ m @-@ mr. burke , please tell me .
he began to believe that he was above men ...
like a god .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
we &apos;re working on that .
almonds .
what ?
he &apos;s been poisoned by cyanide .
everybody get back !
dr. isles .
dr. rizzoli .
dr. rizzoli .
he &apos;s actually a nurse .
that &apos;s--
why do you have to be that way ?
she &apos;s the one who &apos;s disinfecting our clothes .
oh , go talk to your smiley girlfriend .
maybe she &apos;s got a thing for nurses .
yeah , and tell her that she can solve all of her problems
by drinking lots of water and getting tons of sleep .
no , he can &apos;t say that . he &apos;s not a doctor .
i want my clothes back .
tomorrow .
you good ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m saving a ton on dry @-@ cleaning so ...
your clothes are in the back of my trunk .
what about frankie &apos;s ?
yep .
thanks for bringing them .
oh , i guess she likes a man in uniform .
oh , wait .
seriously , you do need to flush out your system .
with alcohol .
exactly . excuse me .
may we get some service for the doctor , please ?
we got a surgery in an hour .
he &apos;s weak , but when he wakes up , he could talk .
thank you , doctor .
hey .
hi .
uh , detective jane rizzoli .
i remember .
thank you .
um mr. burke ...
bob .
okay , bob , um ...
can you tell me about dr. murray ?
he used sound waves to push my cancer into remission .
my oncologist didn &apos;t believe it ,
but the tests showed it was gone .
i quit my job as an accountant to work for dr. murray .
you were his assistant .
i did everything .
i answered phones , handled billing .
um , did you help with the treatments ?
he put patients in specific acoustical environments
that he designed himself .
uh , i adjusted the levels during the procedure .
and what were the results ?
i saw miracles --
arthritis just ... gone ,
scoliosis straightened .
tumors disappeared .
but ... then ...
what ? then what ?
i was an accountant , so i knew spreadsheets .
i catalogued dr. murray &apos;s treatment protocol .
dr. murray was obsessed with data .
he wanted to prove to the medical community
that they were wrong ,
that he had the answer to curing all disease ...
with sound .
i know . i know .
it seems crazy , but that &apos;s what i saw happening .
everyone got better .
but then someone didn &apos;t .
two patients didn &apos;t respond at all ...
and dr. murray went a little ... crazy .
how crazy ?
he killed them .
so the world wouldn &apos;t know he failed ,
and when i wouldn &apos;t help him cover up the murders ,
he came to my apartment and held me down ...
... and poured a vial of cyanide down my throat !
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re gonna have to leave .
he &apos;s gonna come back .
i &apos;m the only one who knows ! he &apos;s gonna come back !
no , you &apos;re safe here , okay ? i promise .
i promise .
no shots ! i will not have any shots !
hey , frankie .
hey , jane . i found a home address for dr. murray .
okay , great . um , text me the address .
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can get a guard on this door .
i don &apos;t expect there &apos;ll be any permanent damage
from the cyanide .
uh , mr. burke experienced a significant amount of vomiting ,
which limited the amount of poison in his system .
well , i &apos;d like to see the results of his tox screen
so i can compare it to what i found in the two victims .
i &apos;d love to help , but i can &apos;t .
i could get a search warrant .
we didn &apos;t do a tox screen .
that &apos;s standard procedure .
it is , but mr. burke
is vehemently against western medicine --
no needles , no tests .
and since he was conscious when admitted ,
we had to ask for his consent , which was denied .
then there &apos;s no way to determine his toxicity levels .
is he aware of how dangerous cyanide is ?
oh , he &apos;s aware .
oh , and against my advice ,
mr. burke &apos;s demanding his release .
susie . grab a collection kit .
hey , korsak .
yo .
look at this .
nice boat .
yeah , perfect for dumping body parts in the harbor .
but who &apos;s doing the dumping ?
oh , boy .
yeah .
dr. isles .
hi . it &apos;s me .
can you send me a photo
of the wear pattern on the bottom of the running shoe
that washed up in the harbor ?
yep .
send it to korsak &apos;s phone .
uh , the sneaker showed pronounced supination
in the wear pattern .
right , and the outside edges were worn down .
yes , it was a specialty running shoe made by altra .
wear patterns match .
yep . same manufacturer . it &apos;s also zero drop .
um , i &apos;m gonna have csru come in here
and bag the shoes and dust the apartment .
wait , jane . there &apos;s something else .
bob burke wouldn &apos;t allow the hospital to run any blood tests ,
so i sent susie over to his apartment ,
and she managed to get some samples
off the welcome mat where he vomited .
okay .
there was no trace of cyanide .
it had to come out , or he &apos;d be dead .
no , no , no , he -- he reeked of it .
i smelled it . the paramedic smelled it .
no , he reeked of almonds
because his discharge was laced with almond extract .
he probably swallowed enough to make himself throw up .
and to make us think he &apos;d been poisoned .
all right . thanks .
burke played us .
yep .
we can &apos;t let him leave the hospital .
harrington &apos;s guarding burke .
that &apos;s dr. murray at the bottom of the harbor .
harrington &apos;s not answering .
frankie .
get everybody to the hospital . bob burke &apos;s our killer .
excuse me .
he looked so sick .
i didn &apos;t think he had enough strength to overpower me .
okay . you all right ?
i &apos;m pissed !
yeah , me too .
jane .
burke &apos;s gone .
he &apos;s got harrington &apos;s uniform .
lock down the hospital . we &apos;re on our way .
no one leaves without my authorization .
riley . brown . come on .
detective rizzoli , how long will this take ?
as long as it takes to make sure everyone &apos;s safe
and to bring burke into custody .
now , we have to lock down the entire hospital
floor by floor .
as my men arrive , they &apos;ll replace hospital security , okay ?
i promise we &apos;ll get it done as quickly as possible .
come on .
so , i need you at the back exit near the loading dock .
detective rizzoli ordered me to sweep the parking lot .
yeah , we &apos;re almost there . what &apos;s the word ?
first two floors are clear .
okay , don &apos;t forget to check the janitor &apos;s closets .
and the air vents .
and the air vents .
he &apos;s not going anywhere .
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s him .
freeze . boston police .
hands in the air now .
you know what &apos;s in here ?
almond extract . goes great with cookies .
you sure about that ?
absolutely .
i love a good almond cookie .
stop .
i &apos;m gonna get in the car now .
don &apos;t come any closer !
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
that better be almond extract .
it is . come on .
i wouldn &apos;t carry cyanide in my pocket .
put your hands on the wheel .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of dr. mark murray
and richard o &apos;connell .
got him .
bob was obsessed with dr. murray
and the idea that he found some miracle cure .
and i went through burke &apos;s charts .
the cures that they were experiencing were temporary .
so they felt better
because they believed they were getting better .
exactly . the placebo effect .
but eventually , the illnesses reasserted themselves .
after a year &apos;s worth of data ,
he knew the experiment had failed .
he wanted to close up shop .
bob wouldn &apos;t let him .
well , why did he kill the other guy ?
richard o &apos;connell realized
he wasn &apos;t getting better with sound .
he filed a complaint with the attorney general &apos;s office .
they opened an investigation .
it &apos;s just all so sad .
but i got to tell you ,
sometimes faith is the only way we get through things .
yeah , but , ma , it can &apos;t be the only thing .
no . that &apos;s why i have you .
excuse me .
excuse me , mr. korsak ,
is this a good time to talk about the bartending job ?
i am so sorry , but that position has been filled .
okay .
that &apos;s who didn &apos;t get the job ?
whoever got hired must be spectacular .
yeah , she could be the future mrs. rizzoli .
i would be okay with that .
actually , she is the current mrs. rizzoli ,
and she &apos;s supposed to be on duty .
i already punched in .
okay , i need a priest and a shrink right about now .
that would be me , frankie !
okay , bartender ,
can i get a shot for my brother , please ?
make it a double , on me .
on the house -- everyone .
ma ! can i get a tequila , three limes , on ice ?
i &apos;m gonna go with a beer chaser with that .
okay , okay , one at a time !
detective rizzoli ?
oh , good . it &apos;s chip .
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
you got me fired .
no , chip , you got you fired .
take credit where credit is due .
thank you . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i needed a kick out the door ,
and she gave it to me .
yeah , she &apos;s good like that .
i hated being a forensic artist .
it was standing in the way of my dream .
besides , who wants to be around death all the time ?
well , sometimes you ...
it &apos;s not that bad .
i understand , chip .
after you were so mean to me , i --
i wasn &apos;t mean .
who wants to lose a tongue ?
you made me realize
there was something missing in bostonia .
i added a vigilante fighting for truth and justice ,
with no regard for the rules .
and now it &apos;s gonna be published .
look for it in your local comic shops .
so ...
this is for you .
oh , my god .
it looks a lot like you .
that &apos;s a lot of , lot of cleavage .
all right . let me see that .
nope . no . can &apos;t look at that .
we &apos;ll need to keep this out of prisons .
yeah .
korsak .
hey , a quarter &apos;s a quarter .
i like it .
really ?
oh , come on . don &apos;t be mean .
you &apos;re gonna have a lot of fans .
