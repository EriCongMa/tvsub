本季终
jeff ...
jessica , you were right .
we either need to have both , or it &apos;s not going to work .
effective immediately , i &apos;m tendering my resignation .
forstman doesn &apos;t throw money around
without getting something in return .
he &apos;s gonna get money in return .
money is third on his list .
the first two are getting back at people
and getting control of people .
son of a bitch .
you didn &apos;t bring me here for you to sign on the arrows .
you brought me here for me to sign on the arrows .
yep .
after woodall lost his job ,
forstman got him installed at the s.e.c. ,
where &apos;s the proof ?
in eric woodall &apos;s bank accounts .
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m your boss .
gentlemen , give me a minute .
you &apos;re forcing me to turn you in
for what you did 12 years ago .
you &apos;re not gonna do that ,
because you did it too , pal .
anyone else every loses faith in me ,
it doesn &apos;t matter .
but with you , it &apos;s different .
i should go .
why ?
you know i love you , donna .
to harvey .
to harvey . cheers .
jay , can i get a macallan 18 ?
you know , usually when someone wins their first trial ,
they at least pretend to finish the drink
their fellow adas bought them .
i &apos;m sorry , do we--
know each other ? not yet .
but today &apos;s your lucky day .
and why is that ?
because it &apos;s the day you get to meet donna .
and let me guess . you &apos;re donna .
oh , you have no idea how donna i am .
well , donna , i &apos;m harvey--
harvey specter .
you really think i &apos;d be talking to you
if i didn &apos;t know who you were ?
and how exactly do you know about me ?
i know about everybody .
what i don &apos;t know is
why this is the first case you ever took to trial .
because it was a white @-@ collar crime ,
not some drug dealer on a corner ,
which makes it the kind of case--
that puts your name in the paper .
you &apos;re not just a pretty face , are you ?
no , i &apos;m not .
so maybe you should buy me a drink ,
and we can continue this conversation in the corner .
jay ?
sean , what are you doing in my building
in the middle of the night ?
i thought we were done with you following me .
i &apos;m not following you .
i &apos;m waiting for you .
i need your help .
you need my help , or the sec needs my help ?
we both do .
but at the moment , i care more about me
than i do about the sec .
i can &apos;t find the money .
what do you mean you can &apos;t find the money ?
what the hell have you been doing for the last three months ?
looking for the money .
then look harder ,
because woodall isn &apos;t in the charity business .
forstman buys people ,
and we handed them to you on a silver platter .
and i stuck my neck out for you ,
and i accused my friend of being on the take .
now , if i can &apos;t follow through with that ,
eric woodall walks .
charles forstman walks .
well , what makes you think i can find the money
when you couldn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know if you can or not ,
but they &apos;re gonna shut me down in five days ,
and i need all the help i can get .
okay , enough about me . let &apos;s talk about you .
ooh , my favorite subject .
you know what i think ?
i think your favorite subject didn &apos;t come up to me
just to find out why i went to trial .
you want something .
i sure do .
and i think i might be ready to give it to you .
it &apos;s not sex .
then never mind .
wow , you &apos;re gonna be that honest about it .
saves time .
well , in that case , i want to move to your desk .
and why is that ?
because it &apos;s no secret that in a few years ,
you &apos;re going back to gordon , schmidt , and van dyke .
and let me guess , you want to come with me when i do .
no , i don &apos;t .
then why ?
because i &apos;m gonna be an actress ,
and i want somebody who understands
that there &apos;s more to life than just the da &apos;s office .
and that i can give my all to them
but still step out for the occasional audition .
so you &apos;re stepping out on me already ?
yes , but the important thing is ,
i &apos;m telling you about it in advance .
macallan 36 .
i didn &apos;t order a macallan 36 .
it &apos;s from the gentleman over there .
okay , i don &apos;t know who that is ,
but i &apos;m telling you right now , he is bad news .
you look different .
i will take that as a compliment .
i meant i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you like that--
i @-@ i know what you meant .
what you really meant is that you weren &apos;t expecting
to see me at all .
excuse me ?
come on , harvey .
ever since mike came back to the firm ,
i &apos;ve basically been nonexistent to you .
what &apos;s going on ?
cahill can &apos;t find the money .
what do you mean he can &apos;t find the money ?
what &apos;s he been doing this whole time ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i said .
and what did he say ?
he said he &apos;s in trouble and he needs our help .
and i &apos;m gonna tell you what i couldn &apos;t tell him .
he can &apos;t find the money
because he &apos;s been looking in the wrong place .
so where &apos;s the right place ?
i don &apos;t know exactly .
but somewhere , there &apos;s a person eric woodall cares about ,
and that &apos;s where the money went .
and why can &apos;t we tell cahill that ?
because i don &apos;t want him to know how i know it .
how do you know it ?
because i know .
you want a chance to exist ?
figure out a way to get this done .
louis , i got your note ,
and i know that norma &apos;s still out ,
but i really don &apos;t have time to--
norma &apos;s dead .
what ?
she died this morning taking care of her sister .
oh , louis , i &apos;m so sorry .
you don &apos;t need to fake it , donna .
i &apos;m not faking it .
she was a sweet woman .
she was a frickin &apos; battle @-@ ax is what she was .
there wasn &apos;t a day that went by
that i didn &apos;t want to rip out
one of her varicose veins and strangle her with it .
okay , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re in touch with
how you &apos;re really feeling right now .
how i &apos;m feeling is that she left me high and dry
just like she always did .
you expect her to keep working ?
look at this .
it &apos;s her entire estate laid out on paper .
she couldn &apos;t manage my calendar ,
but this crap that she plans within an inch of her life .
and you want me to make sure
these things are bequeathed properly ?
you can stuff them in a giant pinata for all i care .
i have to go find the perfect urn
to throw her ashes off the top of the building .
she requested that ?
no , she wanted them to be in here with me ,
but like hell i &apos;m gonna do that .
okay , louis , i will take care of this for you ,
but you &apos;re not throwing her ashes anywhere without me .
okay , fine .
do you want me to smooth things over with harvey for you ?
no .
harvey will be just fine on his own .
i know who you are , and i &apos;m not interested .
just &apos; cause i got a bad reputation ?
because i &apos;m not accepting a drink
for putting your rival behind bars .
you got the wrong idea , pal .
i didn &apos;t buy you that for putting my enemy away .
i bought you that for how you put my enemy away .
okay , you got me .
what are you talking about ?
you .
you &apos;ve got something special .
and i want people with something special
working for me .
why exactly would i want to work for you ?
i can think of a million reasons ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s the signing bonus i &apos;m gonna give you ,
and that &apos;s a hell of a lot more money
than you &apos;re ever gonna make as a lawyer .
and what if i told you
i don &apos;t practice law to make money ?
then i &apos;d ask you , what do you practice it for ?
to bend people to my will .
then bend people to your will for me
and make a lot of money on top of it .
well , here &apos;s the thing , mr. forstman .
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but i &apos;ll be making 1 / 2 million a year in no time .
1 / 2 million a year is dick .
my gardener makes that .
then go offer your gardener a job ,
because i &apos;m not interested .
just so you know ,
if you change your mind and come back to me ,
it &apos;s not gonna be the same conversation .
thanks for the drink . good luck , mr. forstman .
what are you doing ?
what do you think i &apos;m doing ?
if forstman gave the money to someone woodall &apos;s close to ,
we need to start by compiling a family tree .
i meant why aren &apos;t you at school today ?
because i &apos;m gonna prove to harvey that i exist .
okay .
now that you mention it , what was that last night ?
ever since you came back ,
it &apos;s like you and harvey speak this secret language ,
and i &apos;m not a part of it .
rachel , come on . we have history .
i &apos;m not talking about history . i &apos;m talking about respect .
okay , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about
if you think harvey doesn &apos;t respect you .
are you gonna tell me that last night
he didn &apos;t give you a look that said ,
&quot; you don &apos;t need to tell her the full story
because she doesn &apos;t need to know &quot; ?
rachel , he didn &apos;t give me that look
because he doesn &apos;t respect you .
he gave me that look because he &apos;s ashamed .
what are you talking about ?
let &apos;s just say that i &apos;m not the only one
that charles forstman duped .
harvey got taken by forstman ?
yes .
and he only told me because he had to
when we were in the middle of that takeover battle .
that &apos;s why harvey &apos;s so slow to care about anybody .
forstman used somebody he cared about .
holy shit . i never even thought about that .
who do you think it was ?
i don &apos;t know , but i have a pretty good guess .
well , what do you think ?
i think this place is a dump , and i &apos;m busy ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me why we &apos;re here ?
i want to open a restaurant here .
marcus , there &apos;s already a restaurant here .
and it isn &apos;t working .
which is why they &apos;re gonna lose their lease .
take a look .
i &apos;ve got a chef .
i &apos;ve got a liquor license .
i &apos;ve got renovation plans .
i have everything i need .
except the money .
i need $ 150,000 .
are you crazy ?
come on , harvey .
this is my dream .
i know i can make this work .
and i &apos;m not saying you can &apos;t ,
but i don &apos;t have that kind of money .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re the big @-@ time lawyer
who just got his name in the paper .
my name in the paper doesn &apos;t pay me extra money .
i make $ 50,000 a year .
and you said you were gonna be a corporate lawyer .
yeah , and when i am , i can help you , but right now ...
i don &apos;t give a shit about right now .
i give a shit about when you were supposed to be
my big brother , but instead , what did you do ?
i know what i did .
then you know i can never get a loan
for as long as i live .
marcus , when are you gonna take responsibility
for your own shit ?
what the hell does it look like i &apos;m trying to do ?
i came to you first because i know you &apos;d want me to ,
but if you don &apos;t come through ,
i &apos;m gonna go to mom .
you don &apos;t mean mom .
you mean him .
and you &apos;re not taking a nickel from that man .
taking his money isn &apos;t gonna make
what he did to dad any worse .
that &apos;s bullshit , and you know it ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let you do it .
hey , harvey .
how the hell are you gonna stop me ?
am i crazy ,
or is that the same dress you were wearing
the last time i saw you ?
you must be crazy ,
because i don &apos;t wear the same dress ever .
then you must spend a fortune on wardrobe .
but i have to say , it &apos;s worth it .
i suddenly get the feeling this isn &apos;t just a drop @-@ by .
i want to move up our timeline .
harvey , we have a deal .
i put myself on the line for you ,
and our deal is not going to change .
i could just pay you the money back and move on .
and if you could do that , you wouldn &apos;t be here
asking to come back .
how much money did marcus lose this time ?
he didn &apos;t lose anything . he wants to start a restaurant .
he doesn &apos;t want to start shit .
he owes somebody something .
you don &apos;t know that . he &apos;s turned his life around .
what i know is , he has a problem ,
and he &apos;s looking to get money from you .
and you &apos;re not gonna get it from me .
then i &apos;ll get it somewhere else .
and what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i got a job offer from charles forstman .
look at me .
i don &apos;t care what he &apos;s offering you .
don &apos;t take it .
because he &apos;s got a bad reputation ?
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
i think there are a lot of things
you think you know that you don &apos;t .
what i know is , you &apos;re either gonna help me
or charles forstman is .
it &apos;s up to you .
harvey , i can &apos;t make you listen to me ,
but what i &apos;m not going to do is let you come here
and leverage me with some bullshit offer
from a shady banker , so do what you &apos;re gonna do .
but don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
you can buy all the wonder bread you want , eric ,
but you can &apos;t take it with you to prison .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to remind you that once they find the money ,
it &apos;s all gonna come tumbling down .
well , they &apos;re not gonna find the money ,
&apos;cause there is no money .
not in your accounts , but i know what cahill doesn &apos;t .
forstman gave it to somebody you care about ,
and if i tell him that , it &apos;ll be too late .
i know what you &apos;re trying to do .
you &apos;re trying to bait me into moving the body .
we both know you &apos;re not dumb enough to do that .
i &apos;m here to get you to cut a deal
and turn forstman in .
you don &apos;t have the authority to cut a deal .
no , but i can get cahill to
after you hire me to represent you .
you mean hire the fox to watch the henhouse ?
not a chance .
eric , they &apos;re closing in ,
and when they do , you &apos;re gonna want to call me .
so why don &apos;t you take my card ?
this is ridiculous .
woodall &apos;s got 30 people it could be ,
or it could be none of them .
i know that , but this is our job .
no , our job is to help harvey get forstman .
if you &apos;re thinking what i think you &apos;re thinking--
i am , and you are too .
rachel , we are never gonna get harvey
to go after forstman for what they did 12 years ago .
why , because of his brother ?
yes , because of his brother , or because he &apos;s ashamed .
either way , he knows it &apos;s a possibility .
he doesn &apos;t need me to tell him about it .
no , he just doesn &apos;t need me to tell him about it .
rachel--
this is not about that .
look , i can &apos;t tell him
because i &apos;m not supposed to know , but you can .
and i just told you , he doesn &apos;t want to hear it .
and when has that ever stopped you before ?
this is different .
why ?
because he &apos;s ashamed .
then he &apos;s not thinking right ,
and he needs your help more than ever .
then we &apos;re both telling him .
mike , i don &apos;t need the credit .
no , this isn &apos;t about credit . this is about us .
he can &apos;t tell me something and expect me not to tell you .
you wanted to see me ?
yes . where have you been all day ?
why ? is there something you want to talk about ?
yeah , where you &apos;ve been .
sean cahill was at my door last night--
harvey , norma passed away .
i &apos;ve been helping louis .
norma died ?
that &apos;s terrible .
i thought you couldn &apos;t stand her .
i couldn &apos;t , but i assume louis loved her , so ...
do what you need to do .
because she was his secretary , he must have loved her .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
but it is what you said .
okay , donna . what &apos;s wrong ?
how about we start with the fact
that i have been wondering for the last ten hours
if you &apos;re going to acknowledge what happened last night .
but you &apos;re you , so of course you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m not gonna acknowledge it
because nothing happened last night .
why ? and don &apos;t tell me i know why .
because it would have been a mistake , and you know it .
what i know is something happened ,
and you ran away , but not before you told me you loved me .
i did that because i wanted to make you feel better .
what did you just say to me ?
that &apos;s not what i meant . i didn &apos;t say that--
because you pity me ? yeah , you did .
no , i said it because i love you ,
and i wanted you to know it .
love me how ?
why does that have to--
love me how ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
you either can &apos;t answer or you won &apos;t ,
which is bullshit , because obviously ,
you don &apos;t just look at me this way .
you &apos;re capable of looking at me that way ,
but you don &apos;t want to let those worlds collide
because you &apos;re afraid to risk anything .
because we have everything .
no , harvey . you have everything .
so you &apos;re saying you want everything ?
i don &apos;t know , harvey ,
but what i do know is i don &apos;t want your pity .
what are you doing here ? nobody finds out where i live .
i do .
hold on a second . let me turn this off .
you got to be kidding me . you &apos;re watching wall street ?
a monthly ritual to remind myself .
of what ?
of what a pussy gordon gekko is .
now , you want to tell me what changed your mind ?
i decided i wanted the money .
and you turned me down ,
so now you &apos;re gonna tell me why you want the money .
my brother needs $ 150,000 for a restaurant .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
let &apos;s have it .
okay , you want it ?
here it is .
it &apos;s not just a restaurant . it &apos;s a second chance .
marcus has a gambling problem ,
and i gave it to him .
and you think this is his way out ?
i know it is .
we &apos;re not a good fit ,
&apos;cause restaurants fail ,
and when this one does , you &apos;ll leave .
so you might as well leave right now .
then how about we bet on it ?
you &apos;re gonna gamble on something
to get your brother out of a gambling problem ?
i didn &apos;t say i had a problem .
i think maybe you do .
when you always win , it &apos;s not a problem .
i think i might like you , pal .
louis .
i got your message . what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is , they &apos;re trying to screw me ,
and i need you to be bad cop .
what ?
have you made a decision , sir ?
no , i haven &apos;t made a decision , you shyster dealer of death .
okay , i think maybe we &apos;re gonna need another minute .
no , we don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t need another minute to see
that this looks like a pot from home depot ,
this looks like a lamp from motel 6,
and this looks like a goddamn howitzer shell .
you are lucky that i don &apos;t
take this mockery of a final resting place
and shove it up your ass .
louis , that &apos;s enough .
no , it &apos;s not enough .
i &apos;ve been handling this bullshit for two days
for a woman who &apos;s supposed to be handling things for me .
louis , this isn &apos;t about the urn .
oh , please don &apos;t give me that touchy @-@ feely shit .
and why the hell are you not being bad cop ?
because that &apos;s not what &apos;s needed .
oh , bullshit it &apos;s not what &apos;s needed .
louis .
you don &apos;t care about me .
you never cared about me .
all you care about is yourself ...
and your stupid sister and your hummel figurines
and your murder , she wrote reruns .
louis , i &apos;m not norma .
she &apos;s gone ...
and it &apos;s gonna be okay .
she was a battle @-@ ax !
but she was my battle @-@ ax .
i know .
oh , she didn &apos;t just leave me high and dry .
she left me for good .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
both of you ?
we both work for you .
which is why we &apos;re both here to say
maybe it &apos;s time we explore other options .
you got to be kidding me .
you spent two days on this ,
and you &apos;re ready to throw in the towel ?
we &apos;ve spent two of our five days on it ,
and we still don &apos;t have a name ,
so we think it &apos;s time to consider--
what ?
going after forstman
for whatever he did to you 12 years ago .
you told her ?
yes , i did .
because like i said , we both work for you .
which means we both want to help .
you think i haven &apos;t wondered how to go after forstman
100 times in the last dozen years ?
then why don &apos;t you ?
because i &apos;m not the only one at risk .
you mean your brother .
yes , i do .
and i &apos;m not gonna bring him into this ,
because he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
harvey , i &apos;m not saying--
did you hear me ?
he doesn &apos;t just have a gun to my head , okay ?
he &apos;s got one to my brother &apos;s .
and how many times have you told me
that when someone has a gun to your head ,
you figure a different way out ?
this is charles forstman .
there is no other way out .
harvey , there &apos;s--
i gave you a job to do . now do your goddamn job .
well , that was a bust .
we had to try .
did we ?
i told you he &apos;d be pissed off , and he was .
yeah , and you also told me he needed to hear things
that he didn &apos;t want to hear .
okay , well , now all he heard is ,
not only can &apos;t he trust me , he can &apos;t trust you either .
that &apos;s not what he heard , and you know it .
what he heard was that you &apos;re the closest person
in the world to me ,
i am never gonna keep things from you ,
and i &apos;m not the only one in his corner .
i &apos;m the closest person in the world to you .
of course you are . how can you even--
i &apos;m not questioning it .
i &apos;m the closest person in the world to you ,
and i wouldn &apos;t be on your family tree .
you &apos;re talking about woodall .
yes , i &apos;m talking about woodall .
woodall &apos;s married .
we checked his wife . nothing .
that &apos;s the thing . we &apos;re not married .
okay , i really don &apos;t think this is the time to bring that up .
i &apos;m being serious .
we &apos;ve exhausted every person that &apos;s related to him .
maybe it &apos;s time we found someone who isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s genius .
thank you .
now i really don &apos;t understand why harvey doesn &apos;t respect you .
it &apos;s too soon .
it &apos;s too soon for that joke .
too soon .
i can have any one ?
take your pick .
it doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause you &apos;re gonna lose .
that &apos;s funny .
i look at it like i &apos;m gonna win twice .
i get to drive a badass car , and i get to kick your ass .
cocky . i like that .
a guy like you , i &apos;m surprised you could stand working
for cameron dennis in the first place .
what do you mean ?
he doesn &apos;t like cocky .
take , for instance , what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name--dupont ?
what &apos;s he up for ? tax evasion ?
insider trading .
yeah , whatever .
the point is , after what you did the other day ,
why aren &apos;t you leading that ?
because this is cameron &apos;s case .
if i were him , it &apos;d be yours .
harvey , you are his star player ,
and he &apos;s not even putting you in the game .
and on top of that ,
he didn &apos;t have the balls to announce whether he &apos;s going after dupont or not .
don &apos;t you worry about cameron dennis .
dupont &apos;s gonna get what &apos;s coming to him .
that &apos;s exactly what i wanted to hear .
what are you talking about ?
well , you &apos;re loyal to the guy you work for .
i like that .
so you were just talking shit about him
to see if i &apos;d jump on board ?
and you didn &apos;t ...
which is why we don &apos;t have to race anymore .
you &apos;re saying i got the job ?
i &apos;m saying welcome to the team .
well , that &apos;s all well and good , charles ,
but we &apos;re still racing .
we sure as hell are .
we just have to find something else to bet on .
hey , sean . good to see you .
don &apos;t give me that shit .
did you confront eric woodall yesterday morning
at his supermarket ?
i ran into him by accident .
i like the produce there .
i &apos;m not in the mood , harvey .
did you approach the subject of an sec investigation
with the express purpose of intimidating him ?
i approached him with the express purpose
of hiring me as his lawyer .
why the hell would you do that ?
you &apos;re supposed to be helping me .
and if he &apos;s willing to admit what he did ,
that is helping you .
and instead , he &apos;s claiming that i sent you there to intimidate him .
then i guess that &apos;s the way it &apos;s breaking .
what the hell are you talking about ?
he &apos;s either gonna buy what i &apos;m selling
or cover his tracks .
and if he covers his tracks , you need to be there .
are you asking me to follow him ?
no , i &apos;m telling you to follow him .
i can &apos;t do that . i don &apos;t have authorization .
didn &apos;t stop you following me .
enough .
he &apos;s filing charges of harassment against me .
we do this , nothing sticks .
then we might not get him ,
because i have nothing .
well , let me give you a little extra motivation .
remember , woodall knows all about
louis litt &apos;s little forstman transgression .
so if he gets exonerated ,
who do you think &apos;s gonna be the first person he goes after ?
so , instead of going to jersey for your produce ,
go get me something i can use .
you &apos;re having a drink by yourself ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is ,
i just finished having them scrape jeff &apos;s name off his door .
so why don &apos;t you tell me why you &apos;re here , harvey ?
cahill &apos;s having trouble getting evidence
against forstman and woodall .
i &apos;m aware of that .
then you should also be aware that
if woodall keeps his job ,
he &apos;s likely to go after louis .
i could &apos;ve done that math , and so could you ,
so ...
i might be able to help them get forstman ...
on something else .
does this have something to do
with when he offered you that job 12 years ago ?
yes .
i told you that man was trouble .
and i told you i wouldn &apos;t abandon marcus
and you were wrong about him .
so this has something to do with marcus .
yes , it does .
well , if you are asking me to choose
between your brother and louis , you know who i &apos;m choosing .
i &apos;m not asking you to do that .
then what are you asking ?
i want your help to get my mind right .
here &apos;s the thing , harvey .
jeff &apos;s gone ,
and he &apos;s gone because of the choices i made .
so i &apos;m not sure if i can help you get your mind right ,
&apos;cause right now ...
mine &apos;s not right .
hang on a sec .
you didn &apos;t come down here just to give me my start date .
i came down here to tell you
i think you have something special ,
and i &apos;d love nothing more than to have you on my desk ,
but i &apos;m leaving the da &apos;s office .
does this have something to do with that forstman guy
buying you a drink the other night ?
i thought you didn &apos;t know who he was .
well , i looked him up
because i thought i was gonna be working for you .
and i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s shady .
because he &apos;s got a bad reputation ?
i don &apos;t care what his reputation is .
you don &apos;t know this about me yet , but i know people ...
usually better than they know themselves .
and the same way i know you are a good person ,
i can tell you that man is rotten to the core .
you &apos;re just trying to get me to stay
so you can work at my desk .
listen to me .
i don &apos;t care whether i work on your desk or not .
you &apos;re making a mistake if you take a job with that man .
then i guess i &apos;m making a mistake ,
because i already did .
it was nice knowing you , donna .
so you &apos;re keeping her here after all .
yeah , i couldn &apos;t throw her off the roof
after you got me to cry .
i &apos;m glad .
donna , i can &apos;t thank you enough for what you did .
oh , you &apos;re welcome , louis .
the truth is , i needed this more than you know .
well , i get it .
you needed a distraction
after everything you just went through .
uh , yeah . something like that .
truth is ,
i could use a distraction myself .
well , there is one thing that you still need to do .
you need to start thinking about a new secretary .
donna , i know i &apos;ve asked you this before ,
but we &apos;re so much closer now than we were then , and--
louis , i work for harvey .
you know i can &apos;t be your secretary .
but we have this bond ...
you and i.
shakespeare , the gun club .
we &apos;ve always spoken the same language , and you know it .
louis , i can &apos;t .
i get it .
we &apos;re better as friends .
how about i set up a little farewell for norma
as my last official act as your interim secretary ?
thank you , donna .
are you sure we &apos;ve got the right address ?
i &apos;m positive .
i &apos;ll be right back .
can i help you ?
uh , yes , is there a mary ann mcgrath here ?
who can i say is asking ?
we &apos;re with pearson specter litt .
we &apos;d like to speak with her in regards to an ongoing case .
i &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible .
you just said she was here . i don &apos;t understand--
mary ann has advanced alzheimer &apos;s .
but she &apos;s 55 .
it &apos;s early onset , and hers is particularly aggressive .
i &apos;m sorry .
can i ask how long she &apos;s been a patient ?
we &apos;re not supposed to disclose any--
please . it &apos;s really important .
she was moved her about a year and a half ago .
and before that ?
i don &apos;t really know ,
but i don &apos;t think she was getting the best care .
thank you .
my mother &apos;s 55 .
you know , and if she &apos;s only here because forstman pays for it--
i know .
harvey wants us to find
the person woodall &apos;s close to .
that &apos;s all we can do .
well , &quot; all we can do &quot;
is gonna send her back to some horrible facility .
we don &apos;t exactly know that .
yes , we do .
rachel , it &apos;s terrible .
i don &apos;t like it any more than you do ,
but it &apos;s not up to us .
i know .
it just sucks .
you goddamn liar .
oh , don &apos;t be mad .
yeah , conchita tells everybody i &apos;m not home .
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
dupont investments dropped through the floor today ,
and you sold short
based on something that i told you in confidence .
i don &apos;t recall you telling me anything at all .
you son of a bitch .
you made over $ 100 million on that trade .
yeah , i did .
welcome to the real world , pal .
my real world doesn &apos;t involve befriending young attorneys
to get inside information .
maybe you &apos;re not the right man for me after all .
you think i still want to work for you after this ?
you wanted competition and money .
you got the competition .
here &apos;s your money .
you can shove that $ 1 million up your ass ,
because i &apos;m not only not taking your job ,
i &apos;m gonna prosecute you .
then you might as well add your name to the indictment
since you &apos;ve already shared in the profits .
what are you talking about ?
take a look at this check .
it &apos;s not $ 1 million .
it &apos;s 850,000 .
bet you can guess where the other $ 150,000 went .
what did you do ?
you know what i did .
marcus had nothing to do with this .
he wouldn &apos;t have had you said yes right away .
but you didn &apos;t .
we &apos;re giving you the money back .
you &apos;re gonna break his little heart .
he thinks that money came from you .
and you snatch cash out of an addicted gambler &apos;s hands ,
take away his dream ,
only one way that story ends .
so you can either pout about it ...
or you can embrace it and prove to everyone i was right
when i said i saw something special in you .
someday the shoe &apos;s gonna be on the other foot , charles .
words spoken by every loser i &apos;ve ever met .
see you around , pal .
it &apos;s woodall &apos;s first wife .
her name &apos;s mary ann . they grew up together .
they got married when they were 21
and had it annulled six months later .
and what &apos;s the money for ?
she has alzheimer &apos;s .
don &apos;t tell me .
he moved her to a high @-@ end facility
and pays for round @-@ the @-@ clock care .
and the problem is , we called the company
that handles the billing , and--
and everything &apos;s in cash up front ,
probably paid five years in advance .
and mary ann couldn &apos;t tell you because she doesn &apos;t speak .
which mean we don &apos;t have any proof .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go get us some proof .
you did this ?
mike and i both did .
then why isn &apos;t he here ?
you know why .
because it was more you than him .
you did a good job , rachel .
shopping , renting videos .
you must be going stir @-@ crazy .
that &apos;s all right .
my suspension is about to expire .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t count on it .
we found mary ann .
i &apos;m told she &apos;s doing well at the new facility--
you know , the one forstman &apos;s paying for .
you son of a bitch .
i &apos;m not here to exploit your tragedy , eric .
i &apos;m here to tell you it &apos;s over .
well , if this were over ,
you &apos;d be with sean cahill right now ,
which means you &apos;re still looking for me to cut a deal .
i &apos;m looking for you to turn on forstman .
you accost me for the second time in three days
and throw mary ann &apos;s name around
like a bargaining chip ,
and you think i &apos;m gonna help you ?
drop dead .
eric , please .
the reason i knew to look for someone that you cared about
was that forstman did the same thing to me .
he finds your weakness and presses down
until you don &apos;t have the will to stand up to him .
with you , it was an ex @-@ wife with alzheimer &apos;s .
with me ...
it was a little brother addicted to gambling .
i don &apos;t care .
you don &apos;t have proof ,
and you &apos;re not gonna get it in the next 24 hours .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
but here &apos;s the thing .
cahill may have a deadline , but i don &apos;t ,
and i don &apos;t care how long it takes ,
because i &apos;m gonna find that proof
if you don &apos;t turn on forstman .
a lot of you don &apos;t know this ,
but the truth is , i hated norma .
i hated her clogs ,
her mustache ,
her stupid seasonal sweaters .
but the thing i hated most about her
was her favorite story
about how abe vigoda asked her to marry him in 1975 .
i mean , we get it .
you were hot .
you turned him down ,
and it was the biggest regret of your life .
and like everything you ever said ,
i couldn &apos;t stand it at the time .
but now that you &apos;re gone ,
i understand what you meant .
don &apos;t let the moment pass .
don &apos;t let the people you love walk by you
without letting them know how you feel about them ,
because life slips by , and then it &apos;s over .
and i &apos;m not gonna let another minute pass me by
without letting you know how much you mean to me .
i love you , norma .
thank you , louis .
that was a lovely ceremony .
that was beautiful , louis .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
oh , that &apos;s not true .
yeah , it is .
i couldn &apos;t even see how i felt without you showing me .
and the truth is , donna ,
you know me better than i know myself .
like i said , harvey has no idea
how lucky he is to have you .
looking for the money i supposedly gave eric woodall ?
you want to save me the trouble and just admit what you did ?
no , where would be the fun in that ?
fine . keep playing your games ,
but this time , you &apos;re gonna lose .
why , because you think you convinced woodall to give me up ?
yeah , he came to see me .
said you tried to get him to turn me in .
what i said was , you &apos;re an arrogant bastard
who &apos;s spent his life manipulating people .
and you &apos;re the loser who only cares about competition .
not my fault you can &apos;t beat me .
i can this time .
oh , i don &apos;t think so , pal , because ...
he turns on me , i turn on you .
if you &apos;re talking about 12 years ago , let me remind you .
we were both part of that deal .
yes , we were .
all three of us were-- you , me , and your brother .
you leave my brother out of this .
not a chance .
and you don &apos;t leave this woodall thing alone ,
by the time i &apos;m done ,
all anybody will know about 12 years ago
is you gave me a tip
and made sure your little brother profited from it .
i didn &apos;t give you shit .
you tricked me into giving you inside information
and then blackmailed me
by giving marcus money he didn &apos;t even know was dirty .
that may be the truth ,
but they &apos;re never gonna hear it from me .
i &apos;m afraid they just did .
hi , charles .
sean cahill . nice to meet you .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the guy from the sec that isn &apos;t in your pocket .
i asked sean to follow woodall .
couldn &apos;t . no authorization .
but i had no problem getting authorization
to follow you .
which is how i knew when to turn this on .
you &apos;re wearing a goddamn wire ?
for someone whose favorite movie is wall street ,
that &apos;s got to be pretty embarrassing .
son of a bitch .
you may have gotten the better of me 12 years ago , charles ,
but this time , you didn &apos;t .
so remember what it feels like , because i know i will .
harvey , this isn &apos;t over .
words spoken by every loser i &apos;ve ever met .
see you around , pal .
two for two .
he didn &apos;t touch my balls .
black , two sugars , splash of vanilla .
how do you know that &apos;s how i take my coffee ?
the same way i know you &apos;re not taking that job .
you know i &apos;m not taking that job because i came into work today .
no , mr. specter .
i knew you weren &apos;t taking that job
the second you walked away from me the other night .
i told you i know people better than they know themselves .
well , what did you do with tina ?
oh , i had big bertha reassign her .
to who ?
do you really care ?
not a bit .
good .
here &apos;s the deal .
i will take a bullet for you .
and i don &apos;t mean that literally .
but what you do for me is ,
when i need something , you give it to me .
it &apos;s not just a one @-@ way street .
will you also do some actual secretarial work ?
take a look at what i did with your calendar there , hotshot .
holy shit .
when &apos;d you get that done ?
i told you i &apos;m not like every other secretary .
i &apos;m donna .
then let &apos;s get to work .
but for the record , i don &apos;t take vanilla with my coffee .
you will after you taste that .
oh , my god , this is awesome .
when will they learn ?
perfect timing .
and what are we celebrating ?
our win .
&quot; our win . &quot;
i like the sound of that .
me too .
where were you ?
i &apos;ll get into that in a minute .
i want to talk to you for a second .
what is it ?
rachel , you know i told you i loved you
from the second i met you .
well , you loved my pencil skirt .
i loved your face .
you &apos;re the most amazing woman i have ever met ,
and you &apos;re not just beautiful ,
but you &apos;re sweet and caring and kind
and brilliant and tenacious .
mike , are--
are you doing what i think you &apos;re doing ?
i called your father today .
and then i went to get grammy &apos;s ring cleaned .
oh , my--
i don &apos;t want to go 40 years
wondering why i didn &apos;t do this one day sooner .
rachel elizabeth zane ...
i love you ...
and i always will .
you &apos;re my whole life .
will you marry me ?
yes .
yes ?
yes .
all right , here ...
oh , my god .
it &apos;s beautiful .
she wore it every day for almost 60 years .
so will i.
what &apos;s up , dickhead ?
what &apos;s up , loser ?
hey , harvey . good to hear from you .
what &apos;s going on ? everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s okay .
i just haven &apos;t talked to you in a while
and wanted to see how you were doing .
i &apos;m great . katie &apos;s good .
the kids are good . everything &apos;s good .
great .
that &apos;s exactly what i wanted to hear .
you sure there &apos;s nothing going on ?
nothing .
like i said , i just haven &apos;t talked to you in a while ,
and i miss you .
i miss you too , harvey , but unless you got something else ,
i &apos;ve got to go .
the kids are in the bath .
nothing else .
love you , harvey .
i love you too .
listen , i was thinking about what you said ,
about me pitying you .
and i don &apos;t .
nothing could be further from the truth .
i think you &apos;re one of the most amazing women i &apos;ve ever met ,
and just because i don &apos;t--
i &apos;m leaving you , harvey .
what ?
this isn &apos;t working for me anymore .
donna , i know how you &apos;re feeling ,
but you just went through something huge ,
with being on trial , and , uh ...
you need to give it time .
you can &apos;t just quit .
i &apos;m not quitting .
i &apos;m going to work for louis .
donna .
donna , please .
i love you , harvey .
