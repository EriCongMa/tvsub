it &apos;s what you borrow every morning
when this one makes the weird sound .
that &apos;s not a good sound .

it &apos;s a paperclip that you start the car with .

it &apos;s probably nothing .
yeah , it &apos;s nothing .
oh , god .
put the baby &apos;s head at the bottom .
i &apos;m not going to go tomorrow .
i &apos;d rather not , because i don &apos;t want to get an ultrasound .
i just don &apos;t have time .
no , i &apos;ve got some writing i got to do .
the truth is , with working out , i &apos;ve got some people to see ,
so i just can &apos;t make it .
i lost a stamp .
it sounds worse than it is ,
but it &apos;s a somewhat expensive stamp
and i had planned on looking for it .
one of the reasons i moved to los angeles
was to get closer to whales , so i can record them .
i haven &apos;t gotten around to it
because where we live is actually east .
it &apos;s way farther from the ocean than i expected .
i appreciate your concern .
it is really sweet . it &apos;s nice .
but this machine &apos;s still kicking , you know ?
you &apos;re going .
and i know your scared ,
but you know what my mom used to do when i got scared ?
a daffy duck impression .
please don &apos;t do what you &apos;re about to do .
hey , nicholas .
i &apos;m sorry you have a lump in your throat .
that &apos;s despicable !
sorry . too much ?
okay .

i &apos;ll come with you .
oh , absolutely not .
i &apos;ll just sit by the bar .
no way .

can i get a vodka soda ?
thank you . you being normal ...
vodka soda .
okay .
it &apos;s because he refuses to wear a bluetooth . you know that .
i gave him one for his birthday , too ,
but he just laughed in my face .
gave it back to me for hanukkah .
well , according to this website ,
it could be a colloid nodule .
but that &apos;s most common in golden retrievers .
i thought my lifestyle choices would rub off on him .
i tried to set a good example .
treat your body like a temple .
treat your body like a temple .
but he treats his like a dump .
like a dump !
let me see this .
oh , my god .
my friends .
can i just say that these pills are amazing ?
i feel , like , really warm in my uterus .
oh ! i feel good .

i think you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s so sad .
yeah , it &apos;s really sad your friend &apos;s getting
an ultrasound tomorrow .
