30 years ago , ellen asked the marshals
to give this to me if we never saw each other again .
what &apos;s on that cassette ?
just my name and a date .
i &apos;m happy you decided to watch that with us .
you got to pick who you can trust , right ?
whatever &apos;s on here ...
i know .
you ready to see what ellen wanted to show you
when you were 3 years old ?
i am .
that &apos;s the ellen i grew up with .
she was a looker .
neal .
it may be a while before you get to see this ,
... so i &apos;ll just start from the beginning .
i was your father &apos;s partner ...
... in the washington , d.c. , metro police department .
i , uh ... i &apos;m still trying to make sense of this week ...
this year , really .
i &apos;m making this tape , hoping it finds its way to you .
in case you don &apos;t get to see me or your father again .
that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve said that out loud .
by now , i assume you know ...
... that your father &apos;s been accused of a very serious crime .
he told me he was innocent , and i believed him .
i &apos;ve worked with him a long time .
he &apos;s no killer , neal .
the man i know can &apos;t be .
after he was arrested ,
your dad told me that our department
is filled with dirty cops and they set him up .
so i &apos;ve spent the last few months running down leads ,
trying to back up his story .
and he &apos;s right about one thing .
there are dirty cops ... a lot of them .
but did they set him up ?
i thought maybe they had .
and then yesterday ,
your father confessed to the murder .
i tried to talk to him ,
... but all anyone will tell me is that he turned state &apos;s evidence
and you , your mom , and i ...
... are being placed into witness protection .
all the information i &apos;ve found on the others since james &apos; arrest .
only me , your father , and one other cop know about it .
and the other cop ...
i &apos;m not gonna tell you his name for his own safety .
he works undercover . he &apos;s a good man .
i &apos;m gonna keep this box safe .
and , neal , if it you need it ...
the key inside this locket will lead you to it .
that means we get that key and ...
the marshals are shipping us out soon .
i &apos;ve requested to be placed near you and your mom .
and they say there &apos;s a good chance , given the circumstances .
know this ...
i will do everything i can to keep you safe .
goodbye , neal ...
until we meet again .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
you okay ?
well , he turned state &apos;s evidence to save himself .
and he left us .
he forced his family into witsec .
maybe he did it to protect you .
you don &apos;t have all the pieces yet .
we need that key in ellen &apos;s locket .
i &apos;ll call the marshals ,
see if it &apos;s still in her personal effects .
no , we cannot go on record requesting that locket .
what do you propose ?
i show sam the tape , get his take .
okay . we &apos;ll go see him .
peter , we talked about this . no fbi .
neal , the scope of this ...
systemic corruption , missing evidence ,
ellen &apos;s murder , it &apos;s ...
we can &apos;t go outside the lines on this one .
all right .
just give me enough time
to figure out how we can work together .
okay .
but in the meantime , we make a pact .
neither you or i will discuss this ...
the tape , the key , the locket with anyone ,
not even sam .
or diana or jones .
a handshake ? that &apos;s official .
would you prefer a blood pact ?
i &apos;m not a big fan of agreements that require cutting .
neal appears to be handling it well .
well , clearly , they &apos;re lying to each other ,
making some sort of bargain neither of them can keep .
know this ...
i will do everything i can to keep you safe .
goodbye , neal ... until we meet again .
hey , sam , it &apos;s neal .
we need to meet ... today .
neal .
peter in the conference room ?
yeah , listen , rossmeyer global &apos;s v.p.
has been keeping a false set of books
behind the flat @-@ screen in his midtown office .
really ? how did you find out ?
i turned his assistant last night .
nice . you want me to break in ?
no need . asac &apos;s reviewing the paperwork now .
i &apos;m spearheading the takedown .
all right , when &apos;s the raid ?
everything goes smoothly , tomorrow morning .
perfect .
how you feeling today ?
peachy .
good , have you had time to think about
the conversation we had yesterday ?
yeah , i did . thanks .
listen , there &apos;s a lot i &apos;m still ...
i got to sort through .
sure , sure . take your time .
what &apos;s the new case ?
the s.e.c. has asked us to look into what they believe
is an enormous insider @-@ trading ring .
yeah , but these guys aren &apos;t leaving much of a footprint .
we have a list of probably 30 suspects ,
including some fairly well @-@ known traders .
over the last year , they &apos;ve each made massive trades
within hours of a stock skyrocketing or nose @-@ diving .
mm , combined profits of over $ 100 million ... not bad .
the best the s.e.c. could do is target this man
as a potential ringleader .
our job is to prove it .
eric dunham , head of eric dunham capital .
you know him ?
yeah , our paths crossed a couple times
when i was head of acquisitions for vincent adler .
of course , back then , my name was ...
nick halden .
welcome back , nick . the fbi requires your services .
you want to see if nick can get in on the action ?
well , having worked for the biggest swindler on wall street
might work to your advantage .
any idea on how to make the approach ?
yeah . come out swinging .
still taking it easy on your opponents , eric ?
nick halden . i thought you were dead .
that was adler .
you &apos;ve been m.i.a. almost as long . what happened to you ?
doesn &apos;t matter . important thing is i &apos;m back .
not important to me .
we made a lot of money together , eric .
we can do it again .
i &apos;m ready to get back in the ring .
you got two minutes to convince me .
i served my time , eric .
let me show you what i can do now .
how much did you know about the adler ponzi scheme ?
enough to know when to get out .
well , he was a fraud ,
and the people that he swindled were idiots .
look , go back to hong kong , okay ?
or , better yet , go to cupertino 2 in russia ,
where they &apos;re overflowing in cash and wanting in charm .
charm has its purposes .
it &apos;s a great way to gather information .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
are you familiar with rossmeyer global ?
is he about to tell an inside trader
about an active investigation ?
caffrey , do not do this .
short &apos; em .
why ?
rossmeyer &apos;s about to take a massive dive .
get out , fast .
keep in touch .
i want a tap on dunham &apos;s phone ... now .
you &apos;re jeopardizing a 2 @-@ year federal investigation
and allowing dunham to make millions off of it .
oh , no . technically , it &apos;s either one or the other .
if he makes millions ,
he won &apos;t jeopardize the investigation .
he &apos;s working with at least 30 other traders .
if he puts it out there ...
he won &apos;t .
and why ?
because he &apos;s thorough .
he &apos;s not a day trader who &apos;s gonna call his broker
because he overhears gossip on the subway .
he &apos;s gonna watch rossmeyer global
and see what happens .
i want us working on the same page here ... on all fronts .
i hear you .
shotgun .
no , jones called it .
what ? i wasn &apos;t even here yet .
he called it .
i wasn &apos;t even here yet .
he can &apos;t call it until i &apos;m done with ...
yeah , he can call it . he can .
all right , here we are .
you &apos;ve done well for yourself .
well , there are worse accommodations
for a convicted felon .
can i get you something ... beer , wine ?
blue label ?
nah , just water , thanks .
make yourself at home .
thanks .
ellen said my dad made a deal before
he went into witsec .
back to the ground rules . i ask the questions .
no , not anymore .
goes both ways now .
you got something for me ?
maybe .
i was undercover with the flynns organization
back in the early &apos; 80s .
they were a local crime family with some p.d. on the payroll .
including my father ?
including your father .
did he turn on the cops ?
he turned state &apos;s on the flynns .
his testimony brought down almost the entire organization .
where is he now ?
i got to be honest with you ... i ain &apos;t looking for him .
are you ?
no .
can you tell me anything about him ?
i already told you ... he played a mean game of darts .
okay , we were in the same class at the academy ,
so i knew him about as well as anybody .
and i can tell you this ... he never shut up about you .
you &apos;d think he was the only guy on the planet who had a son ,
the way he carried on .
one day , he brought you down to the precinct
and he introduced you around as a junior detective
to every cop in the house .
i mean , you just loved that .
and then , i remember , at some point , you drifted away .
man , did he panic .
he had about 10 detectives looking for you .
we finally found you in the captain &apos;s office ,
... wearing his hat .
i guess you always had a thing for hats .
i don &apos;t remember that .
well , you were young .
i &apos;d really like you to meet peter .
your handler ? that &apos;s not gonna happen .
he &apos;s a friend . he &apos;s not ...
you gave me your word ...
no feds , or i &apos;m gone .
all right .
listen , with your skill set ,
you can help me find ellen &apos;s killers .
and i &apos;ll make deal with you ... as soon as we do that ,
i will tell you everything i know about your father .
that &apos;s not really what i &apos;m asking for .
yeah , it is .
you want to know what happened to him ,
why he never contacted you , and where he is now .
but for now , you brought me here for a reason .
so , do you have something to share with me ?
you expecting somebody else ?
no .
all right . in there is fine .
elizabeth . hey . what &apos;s this ?
dessert , homemade .
thank you . well , come on in .
what did i do to deserve , uh ...
pistachio gelato ?
i know you &apos;re going through a lot right now ,
with ellen sending you that ...
yeah , i know . it &apos;s wild , right ?
yeah , look , i just thought maybe you could ... use a friend .
i know sometimes , well ,
peter &apos;s a little difficult and hard to talk to .
no .
he is , and he understands that ,
which is why i think he was grateful
that you chose him to share the tape with ...
... even before you knew what was on it .
we &apos;re always gonna be here for you .
did peter put you up to this ?
no .
but i do know about the pact ...
which i meant every word of .
he &apos;ll find her killer if you let him .
i know .
anyway , thank you , again , for everything .
listen , uh , thank you again .
you know how i love pistachio .
hey , hon , i &apos;ll be home soon .
well , i may not be .
i just re @-@ parked in front of neal &apos;s place .
is he home ?
yeah , i just dropped off gelato .
oh , shoot . that wasn &apos;t for me ?
i made plenty .
good . how &apos;s he doing ?
well , um , i &apos;m sitting here .
and i wasn &apos;t planning on spying .
but ...
i think he &apos;s with someone . he rushed me out the door .
i saw that there was two glasses of ice water ...
one in the sink and one on the table .
i figured if it was a date ,
there &apos;d be lipstick on one of them
and he &apos;d be serving wine instead of water .
that &apos;s good spying .
no wine ? we can rule out mozzie .
yeah .
oh , wait .
someone &apos;s coming out . i &apos;ll take a picture .
so , you were delivering ice cream , huh ?
gelato . i &apos;m e @-@ mailing you now .
did you get it ?
yeah , i got it . it &apos;s sam .
what does that mean ?
it means i should have made a blood pact .
neal broke our agreement .
morning .
morning .
how was your night ?
sweet . thank you for the gelato .
that was all elizabeth &apos;s doing .
pistachio still your favorite ?
truth be told ,
i &apos;ve been leaning more toward the sorbets of late .
good to know . and thank you for your honesty .
always the best policy .
anything else you &apos;d like to share ?
my socks itch .
all right .
now that we &apos;re done catching up ,
diana &apos;s moving on rossmeyer global as we speak .
news should hit by the morning bell .
well , dunham moves fast .
he &apos;ll have me working for him by lunch .
here . we &apos;ll be listening .
nice job , neal . good strategy yesterday .
you were absolutely right , and i was overly concerned .
we &apos;ll see .
went off without a hitch .
we should have everything cleared out by noon .
excellent .
i knew you could handle rossmeyer global .
thank you . samuel phelps .
neal &apos;s elusive friend , yeah .
did you uncover anything else about him ?
there wasn &apos;t much i could find
without running an official request .
why ?
neal met with him again ...
not that he shared that information with me .
well , i can put in for a background check ,
but it &apos;s gonna make some noise .
sam &apos;s got neal convinced they can only investigate off @-@ book .
so , he can do it his way , i &apos;ll do it mine ,
and we &apos;ll both pretend neither are doing either .
you got it , boss .
thanks .
of course i didn &apos;t short rossmeyer global .
well , you should have .
i didn &apos;t know if your information was good .
now i do .
so i &apos;m hired .
this company is survival of the fittest .
your salary is minimum wage ,
and your bonus is based entirely on what you bring in .
we eat what we kill . i get it .
here you go , kelly .
thanks .
save paper . send an e @-@ mail .
right .
you have no shot , by the way .
bye .
every tuesday after market close , we hit my club .
you familiar with white @-@ collar boxing ?
battle of the one @-@ percenters .
this isn &apos;t a boy &apos;s fight club .
it &apos;s for people like you , who value information .
information isn &apos;t cheap .
no. 25 grand at the door .
you &apos;ll find out the rest if you join .
yes ?
i got this .
going to lunch .
how &apos;s my portfolio ?
good . good . you been listening to the news ?
every word .
you want me to authorize 25 grand
so you can watch guys in suits beat up on each other ?
it &apos;ll pay off .
listen , we need two things
in order to bust dunham for insider trading .
i &apos;m listening .
you &apos;ve got to record dunham giving out this information .
hearsay isn &apos;t enough to make an arrest .
i &apos;ll make that happen for you .
second , you have to find out
where dunham &apos;s getting this information .
i hear you loud and clear ...
which reminds me ... you may want to warn el .
the flowers that were charged to your credit card
aren &apos;t for another woman in your life ... it was my doing .
she &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
neal just sent us these photos of the wolfson report ,
wall street &apos;s bible on emerging market stocks .
dunham had it hand @-@ delivered ,
and he put it under lock and key in his office .
this report that dunham received goes out tomorrow ,
yet he received it today .
dunham must be paying someone off
to messenger him an advance copy .
because the stock price of any company
featured in the &quot; one to watch &quot; column is gonna spike .
i &apos;ve contacted wolfson to start an investigation ,
but the bigger fish is dunham .
he &apos;s charging his buddies 25 grand a week
for this insider information .
neal will be sitting next to him at the fight this afternoon .
once he gives him a tip ... bam ... lights out , dunham .
fight !
the guy in the maroon ... what &apos;s his story ?
oh , latham ... yeah , he &apos;s a tough son of a bitch .
do you pick the opponents ?
yep .
five fights a night .
if you throw your hat in the ring ,
i make sure you get an even match .
so , what does my 25 grand get me ?
a night of entertainment , my friend .
i was under the impression
you were gonna give me some information to trade on .
no , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not how it works .
but you step into my ring ,
you &apos;ll finally get a fair fight .
1 ... 2 ... 3 !
get up , you bum !
it &apos;s over !
that &apos;s it !
so , to get the tip , i have to get in the ring ?
no . you have to win .
and until then , you &apos;re outside .
excuse me .
all right , gentlemen , gather up .
guys , we got a major problem .
what ? i &apos;ll get the tip next week .
only if we fix the wolfson report .
they revised the column
after i told them they had a leak .
so , tomorrow , when the new one comes out
that &apos;s different than dunham &apos;s ,
he &apos;s gonna know his source has been compromised .
we have to sell dunham on a plausible reason
he would believe a revisal on the report .
dunham &apos;s not the only one with an inside source .
you want to give him a tip that would conflict with wolfson ?
yeah .
so you feed dunham some breaking inside information ...
get dunham to assume wolfson heard the same information
and retracted their pick .
oh , but that &apos;s gonna feel pretty convenient
that you happen to have info on the same company
in the wolfson &apos;s report .
not if i bury it in a laundry list of overnight intel .
so , what ... you come in with a bunch of tips ,
and then make the off @-@ handed mention
that a scandal &apos;s about to break at caleros coffee ?
okay , i &apos;ll admit it needs some finessing .
anybody have a better idea ?
all right , let &apos;s get cracking on that laundry list .
we &apos;ve only got a few more hours until the market opens .
hey , eric .
hey , man , i &apos;ve been thinking about it .
i want to get in the ring . i want to box .
oh , that &apos;s fantastic .
do you want me to call a press conference ?
please tell me that &apos;s not the only reason you stopped me .
it &apos;s not .
i also wanted to show you my revised numbers on corn futures .
anything else ?
and a few pieces of intel i &apos;ve been hearing about in the ether .
this one ... caleros coffee .
i &apos;m not an expert in colombia
but apparently the c.e.o. has been involved
in some kind of scandal ... they &apos;re keeping it quiet .
okay , how do you know about a secret scandal
and emergency board meeting in bogota , colombia ?
it &apos;s better that you don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s not good enough .
well , it &apos;s gonna have to be .
i don &apos;t need you .
so , one of two things is gonna happen here ...
either you &apos;re going to tell me who your source is
or you &apos;re gonna crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of ,
never to be heard from again .
okay , the reason i stand behind my information
is because i &apos;m getting it directly from the fbi .
and here we go again !
former fbi , to be clear , white collar division .
who ?
peter slauson ... he runs a small private hedge fund .
never heard of him .
yeah , i mean , that &apos;s exactly how he likes it .
i only know him because of the adler ordeal .
i want to meet him .
well , he &apos;s not exactly a warm and fuzzy guy ,
and he doesn &apos;t want to make any new friends .
i don &apos;t care . set it up . we &apos;re going to his offices .
all right .
he &apos;s in midtown , on 47th and park .
quick . rossmeyer global ... is it empty ?
we cleaned it bare .
all right , call the harvard crew . get them over there .
we got to make it look like a hedge fund .
hello .
peter , it &apos;s nick halden .
and i realize this is probably an inconvenience ,
but i have a colleague who wants to meet with you ... today .
we &apos;re actually gonna be in your neighborhood ,
and this meeting is pretty time @-@ sensitive .
it could also be highly lucrative , so how about 11 : 00 ?
highly doubtful . try after lunch .
perfect . i &apos;ll see you at 11 : 00 .
don &apos;t come inside .
i &apos;ll be at the doors .
they &apos;re a block away .
all right , diana , can you make sure there &apos;s money in the account ?
you got it .
i have an idea .
turn this meeting into our favor .
he &apos;s not gonna be happy about this ...
i &apos;m just telling you right away .
mr. slauson . this is eric dunham .
eric dunham capital . right .
you two are working together .
nick , you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
yeah , listen , i made an exception because ...
well , actually , i insisted .
i understand you have a background with the fbi .
white collar division . why ?
well , nick here speaks very highly
of your ability to get information .
people can &apos;t keep secrets from me .
the fbi has unparalleled reach .
yeah , from here all the way to bogot , colombia .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s right ... caleros coffee .
you have skin in the game ?
you &apos;re a sports fan , huh ?
the three b &apos;s ... baseball , basketball , and boxing .
so , white @-@ collar boxing club ...
$ 25,000 gets you in the club ,
but you have to fight to get the real reward , correct ?
it , uh , takes a certain type to join my club .
good .
i want in the ring .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a good idea .
what &apos;s your skill level ?
about the same as nick &apos;s .
i &apos;ve got youth .
i have experience and a longer reach .
well , looks like we got ourselves a fight .
good .
what was that about ?
i wanted in on the fight .
no , i figured that out ,
so one of us is guaranteed to win
and hear dunham give his tip .
beats a 50 / 50 chance
of some aggro wall street hustler beating your brains out .
no . what else were you trying to imply ?
&quot; people can &apos;t keep secrets from me .
the fbi has an unparalleled reach . &quot;
you tell me .
this is about sam .
peter , there is nothing to tell you .
okay .
is there something you want to share with me
about the fbi &apos;s unparalleled reach ?
no , neal , there &apos;s nothing to tell .
okay .
okay .
great . let &apos;s talk about the fight .
great . let &apos;s talk about the case .
hey . i &apos;ll be the ring girl
if that &apos;s what it takes to watch you two duke it out .
yeah , my money &apos;s on peter .
now , why would you say that ?
because we &apos;re gonna choreograph it so peter wins .
but you could choreograph it so that i win .
but we won &apos;t because it &apos;s better if dunham gives the tip
directly to an fbi agent .
i just think it &apos;s more realistic if i win .
all right . let &apos;s take a vote .
who thinks i should win the fight ?
that would be you , boss .
all you . yeah .
but they work for you .
as do you .
let &apos;s put this plan in motion .
sounds good .
sam , special agent peter burke , fbi .
i &apos;m neal &apos;s friend and handler .
you must be sam .
come on in .
sam , you &apos;re a tough man to find .
your former colleagues speak very highly of you .
you investigated me ?
i investigate anyone who comes into neal &apos;s life ,
especially when it &apos;s tied in to murder and conspiracy .
did he send you ?
no . he doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re running around behind his back .
you sure that &apos;s in his best interests ?
he doesn &apos;t want to break his word with you
and involve the fbi .
with good reason , agent burke .
who are you afraid of , sam ?
i don &apos;t know .
i still don &apos;t know who killed ellen .
then let &apos;s figure it out .
what do you want ...
me to tell neal that the three of us should work together ?
yeah , i do .
and then what ?
we combine resources .
why don &apos;t you suggest it ?
i have .
the idea has to come from you .
oh ? and why is that ?
you know the agent / c.i. relationship .
he doesn &apos;t get that i &apos;m trying to protect him .
i got to think this through . it &apos;s not what i was planning .
i &apos;m asking you ,
from one law @-@ enforcement official to another .
i understand .
he &apos;s your asset .
yeah , that &apos;s part of the arrangement .
i think peter told the fbi about the tape .
what do you expect ?
him to trust me .
yeah , a man who trusts no one is apt not to be trusted .
listen , i kept up my end of the bargain .
neal , this is me ... mozzie , the human lie detector ,
and i &apos;m buzzing off the charts here .
i met with sam , but i didn &apos;t show him the tape .
oh , welcome to gleason &apos;s uptown .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
mozzie &apos;s got experience as a cornerman .
and a marginally good day to you , too , sir .
real experience , or you just fix fights ?
what ? rigged boxing matches ? say it ain &apos;t so !
jones has actual experience .
he &apos;s gonna be my ringman ,
and he &apos;s gonna place a microphone ringside
so we can record dunham after the fight .
okay . it should be epic .
this battle should be legend in dunham boxing lore .
okay . let &apos;s re @-@ create a classic .
how about the heavyweight title bout , ali vs. foreman ?
rumble in the jungle ... i like it .
let &apos;s go .
all right .
so , neal , you &apos;re gonna come out swinging .
peter , you &apos;re gonna bide your time ,
absorb some punches ,
wait till the moment is right to strike .
listen , stylistically , neal is more muhammad ali .
well , historically , ali won . neal needs to lose .
no problem . i &apos;ll be george foreman .
oh , he makes a fantastic grill .
easy , don king . can we practice a few things ?
if i &apos;m coming out swinging ,
i &apos;m just gonna start throwing some light jabs ,
light hooks , just knock it down .
yep . pop . okay . that &apos;s good .
let me get in and do this combination here . that &apos;s good . okay .
right to the body .
left to the body .
okay . left up top . duck .
swing at me .
uppercut . right ?
ooh , yeah .
that &apos;s good .
oh , you okay ?
gotcha .
i want to kill you .
oh , you &apos;re crazy .
i &apos;m rough and tough .
we need some kind of signal for the knockout punch .
okay .
let the signal be tapping the gloves .
okay , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna check in with you .
i &apos;m gonna acknowledge that .
eyes and then ...
peter , give the signal .
i did . - then you &apos;re gonna go up top , left feint .
block it .
and then you &apos;re gonna right cross to the body .
and then you &apos;re gonna finish with a left hook .
okay .
all right , now , the timing &apos;s got to be right with that one .
or ?
you &apos;ll break his jaw .
all right .
touch gloves . let &apos;s try it again .
how &apos;s your dental coverage ?
run by the federal prison system .
let &apos;s go over the plan again .
sam .
sam ?
listen , neal , it &apos;s not safe for me here anymore .
what &apos;s wrong ?

thank you .
strength wasn &apos;t enough to get you here today .
it took speed , stamina , endurance .
you did what it took , whatever it took , to win .
you exploited your opponents &apos; weaknesses .
right now , they &apos;re walking home , licking their wounds ,
while you , my friends , get to act .
celestar biotech .
celestar biotech .
limit your trades to half a million .
and if any of you share this information outside of this room ...
you &apos;re going to jail .
excuse me ?
no , really . you &apos;re going to jail .
fbi . cuff him .
where &apos;s neal ?
i got a pretty good idea .
hey . stop !
what did you do , run him through the database ?
neal , stop .
and then you met with him , the one thing he didn &apos;t want .
give me a break .
all bets were off once you showed him the tape .
i never showed him the tape !
the point is you said you weren &apos;t gonna meet with him .
no . no . i said i wouldn &apos;t show him the tape .
i met with him
because he &apos;s the only person who has any connection to ellen .
he knew her . he knew my father .
you should have told me .
i don &apos;t have to report to you every move i make .
yes , you do .
no ! i get to have a private life .
not about this ... you don &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s the heart of our problem , isn &apos;t it ?
you don &apos;t trust me .
you still don &apos;t trust me .
the door &apos;s open . stay here .
he &apos;s gone , peter .
i &apos;ll call it in .
we &apos;ll find sam .
this is exactly why sam didn &apos;t want you running his name .
they found him because of you .
they found ellen because of you .
neal ...
i may be a ward of the state ,
and i will do my job for the fbi .
but as far as my personal life goes , we are done .
we are done .
