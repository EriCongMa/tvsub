第五季第七集
jeff , we &apos;ve known each other a long time , right ?
you &apos;ve come to respect me .
sure .
well , get ready to stop .
please help me seduce britta
now that you &apos;ve finished doing it with her .
please , please ...
do you even really like britta ?
it seems like you like her because she doesn &apos;t like you .
have you met the women that do like me , jeff ?
neither have i , but trust me , they &apos;re bad people .
fine .
to get near britta , think like britta .
grab one of those free papers for hippies on the quad ,
go to the calendar page ,
and find a cause so tragic ...
are you writing this down ?
okay , we have confirmation that all the bones
have been removed from the football field .
and we agree that teachers should get
a 10 @-@ minute head start at the job fair .
any other items ?
it &apos;s friday night .
what &apos;s everybody doing ?
oh , there &apos;s a benefit show at the forefront theater
in riverside for starving children
with cleft palates .
i &apos;m gonna crash the premiere of the kickpuncher reboot
dressed like classic kickpuncher .
they shouldn &apos;t have redesigned that costume .
keep your heads in the sand if you want .
professor duncan , i didn &apos;t know that cause interested you .
well , it &apos;s starving children with cleft palates , britta .
what part would you have me be disinterested in ?
forefront theater ?
what time ? i &apos;m going .
i &apos;m going too .
me too .
kids with cleft palates should have extra food , not less .
i &apos;m in .
i have ... dinner plans .
yeah , make sure it &apos;s a hearty meal .
help me out here .
are you really the one that needs help here , winger ?
yeah , should we write a check to the jeff foundation ?
okay . maybe i &apos;ll go too .
well , it &apos;s the least you can do .
yeah , feels good to help .
god bless you .
cool , so 7 : 30 ?
did you get it ? i don &apos;t think i got it .
well , the ants were people .
the queen ant was an oil company .
okay , so it was about our marginalized perceptions
as drones being born into a corporate hive @-@ mind ?
yeah .
mcdonald &apos;s ?
oh , i was just thinking about that .
hungry .
hello ?
okay , alessandra , i can &apos;t talk right now .
i just got out of a show .
okay , hold on .
well ?
look , if you &apos;re gonna just yell at me , why ...
why are you doing this ?
this is not happening to you , okay ?
it &apos;s happening to us !
well , you called me !
well , then let me be the one to do this !
uh , my mother used to tell a story about how she killed a chicken .
hong kong , 1964 .
so you like the theatre , ian ?
oh , are you kidding ?
i spent half my days at university in wigs and tights .
you don &apos;t do that without befriending some actors .
oh , my god , michael .
i know michael from my anarchist days .
god , he &apos;s gonna smell the sellout on me .
hey . how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t like this &quot; my @-@ kale &quot; guy .
i don &apos;t think he likes himself ,
or he &apos;d pronounce it &quot; michael . &quot;
isn &apos;t she great ?
she &apos;s everything i love about america .
bold , opinionated , just past her peak ,
and starting to realize that she has to settle for less .
and the moment she needs a shoulder to cry on ,
huh ? the duncan handkerchief .
well , i &apos;m out .
have fun circling my former lover ,
waiting for her to cry .
i tried to make that sound good ,
but that &apos;s what you &apos;re doin &apos; .
uh , you &apos;re all heroes tonight for making a difference ,
but i want to introduce one of my heroes .
britta perry .
she is the bravest , most passionate activist
i have ever had the honor of imitating .
so , hey , buy her a drink .
anything you wanna add , britta ?
oh . wow , um , i &apos;m not a hero .
i &apos;m a high school dropout and a bartender ,
so don &apos;t listen to me .
or anyone .
just listen to yourself ,
and make sure you tell yourself the truth .
well , it was ... it was great seeing you , so ...
i might stay for one drink .
why ?
i like to drink .
oh , really ?
yeah .
i have a serious problem .
that had better be true .
cool . cool , cool , cool .
i am kickpuncher .
you are in violation of future law .
oh . damn it , come on .
what are you doing ?
what ?
what , what are you doing ?
making a costume for a movie premiere .
annie banned glue guns from the apartment
after an incident so hilarious that even describing it
would narratively eclipse what &apos;s happening here .
what &apos;s happening here ?
you and me bonding .
check it out .
tell me the truth : if you were a post @-@ apocalyptic survivor ,
i would raise goats , hoard cinnamon .
and travel only at night .
but , please , i have some work to do here .
just one thing . watch this .
initiate ballistic foam .
what the hell ?
sorry .
you just destroyed five hours of work !
i &apos;ll clean it up .
no , you don &apos;t touch it !
i know this is bad timing ,
but i should go if i &apos;m gonna make the movie , so ...
what are you doing ?
something nobody ever does .
teaching you consequences .
but i have to go .
but you can &apos;t .
huh , isn &apos;t that crazy ?
you ever been grounded ? you ever been punished ?
do you have any idea what it feels like
to be refused something ?
i know what it feels like when people try to control me .
you should know it never goes their way .
and what &quot; kicky punch &quot; movie is that from ?
the ones you &apos;ve seen
or the one i &apos;m gonna watch you miss ?
i said i was sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i punched my landlord ,
but i &apos;m not gettin &apos; my deposit back .
that &apos;s an example of you being punished
for choosing to hurt someone .
i wrecked your papers by accident .
you chose to spray this crap on purpose
because you didn &apos;t care what happened .
you know , let me tell you something .
for five years , i have watched people
walk around on your eggshells .
&quot; oh , abed . he &apos;s so imaginative , so magical . &quot;
&quot; everybody hide their hamburgers !
&quot; if abed sees a hamburger , we &apos;ll all travel in time . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s eat cookies and ice cream
and dress in pajamas in the middle of the day . &quot;
i watched my third wife die !
you think i &apos;m spoiled ?
and you think i &apos;m spoiled because it &apos;s never occurred
to anyone to do this ?
you &apos;re not the marco polo of bullying me .
you &apos;re just another tourist taking pictures of a great , big wall .
oh , you &apos;re gonna make me cry .
when &apos;s the last time someone physically limited you ?
oh , just now .
you physically ruined my drawings .
drawings of what ?
you &apos;re an artist ?
i destroyed something valuable ?
looked like you were doodling chickens .
he is a duck !
hey !
you &apos;re not allowed in there .
well , i just did a one @-@ man show
for a little audience that would beg to disagree .
audience ? in there ?
we haven &apos;t had a single person or performance
in that theater since the 1997 fire .
24 people died .
so what have you guys been up to ?
well , this . raising money .
organizing . trying to make a difference .
i &apos;m impressed , and embarrassed .
i sold out .
we sold out .
you did not sell out .
i &apos;m going to community college to start a career .
we &apos;re in real estate .
we own the building we &apos;re standing in .
wow . you guys did sell out !
i know !
i should introduce myself to her friends .
i knew it !
you don &apos;t have a drinking problem !
you have feelings for britta , you disgusting monster !
fine . yes .
something about everybody liking her turns me on .
it &apos;s a problem i have .
i hated reese &apos;s pieces before
e.t. ate them , sorry .
you &apos;re a bad friend !
that &apos;s not fair !
wait , that &apos;s really not fair . you &apos;re a terrible friend .
she was mine first .
and it &apos;s not like she belongs to anybody .
oh , here we go .
&quot; love isn &apos;t a game , &quot; say the guys that always win .
and now , you &apos;re going to go pull a dane cook
in one of those three movies he was in
about dane cook getting laid by accident .
only it &apos;s not a dane cook movie , jeff ,
because this time , someone &apos;s watching : me .
your friend , british jason biggs .
if you never call me dane cook again , i &apos;ll stand down ...
for an hour .
okay . an hour .
are your duck drawings a secret ?
is that why you do &apos; em when nobody &apos;s around ?
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but i am a cartoonist in my spare time .
my cartoon &apos;s about a duck . i was drawing him .
does the duck have a name ? does he have powers ?
i &apos;m not pitching to you .
you &apos;re afraid i won &apos;t like it .
sure .
i &apos;ve been a cab driver , a soldier , a cop ,
but what terrifies me the most
is the opinion of a manchild in cardboard pants .
kickpuncher was a cop before he became a cyborg .
so you were a cop before you became ... this .
and what were you before this ?
were you normal ?
or do you act like this because
somebody stuffed you in a locker ?
is that the idea ?
other way around .
what else do you want to know about me ?
what makes you stop talking .
letting me go .
after you miss your movie .
because you want me to suffer .
for destroying your duck cartoons ?
the ones you &apos;re ashamed of ?
uh , which one were you laughing at ?
no , no , no , no , no ! stop that !
you &apos;re ghosts !
we &apos;re ghosts ?
the janitor out there told me you died in 1997 .
janitor ?
those guys in there told me
that you &apos;re the one that died in a fire
and you &apos;re a ghost !
and you just believed &apos; em ?
you just believed a bunch of ghosts ?
have you guys seen that billboard on water street
for consensual perfume ?
the one with the man chasing the woman through the grass
and it says , &quot; proven in its field &quot; ?
yeah , proven in its field
and in labs on the eyeballs of rabbits .
we should make it say that ! who &apos;s got the spray paint ?
no , guys , i &apos;m serious !
doug and janet , you &apos;re on lookout .
michael works the ladder . i will banksy that mother !
come on , guys , we gotta start taking risks again .
well , that &apos;s convenient for the one with nothing to lose .
oh , so the person with the least wealth
has the least valid argument ?
that &apos;s convenient .
britta , how many people have you fed this year besides yourself ?
oh , janet ...
no , look .
i &apos;ve spent enough time feeling bad .
fight the power !
would you like to go ...
yeah .
yeah ?
oh , my god .
坐这里喂鸽子
面筋
these are really good .
it helps me to see why you were so upset .
did i ruin anything as good as what &apos;s in here ?
ah , just practic drawings .
i have to practice drawing the duck from different angles .
it &apos;s hard when his back &apos;s turned 3 / 4 because of the beak .
well ... i &apos;m a real jerk for wrecking it .
ah , you didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
that doesn &apos;t excuse my behavior .
no , i appreciate that .
it &apos;s a good apology . you &apos;re a good kid .
all right . well ...
i can see from the clock that if i hit all the green lights ...
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t let you go .
that &apos;d undercut the larger lesson .
yes , the lesson being that you &apos;re very talented .
but i have this thing . i can &apos;t walk into a movie ...
you &apos;re not going to the movie .
yes , i am .
you need this .
let me go !
this is you learning .
you &apos;re a bad person and a bad cartoonist .
you go ahead . hurt my feelings .
oh ! you have feelings , huh ?
have you considered putting them into your work ?
your cartoons are monuments to joylessness ,
nervously assembled jokes based on nothing from your life
or anyone &apos;s life !
you &apos;re furious at me for being creative
because you want to be able to create .
you have all this rage and shame and loneliness ,
which i don &apos;t even know how to feel much less understand ,
and you decide to put what on paper ?
a duck . jim the duck . you think i &apos;m crazy .
you think there &apos;s something wrong with me .
jim the duck ?
publishers are interested !
oh ! yeah , well , publishers are stupid .
either that or you &apos;re misinterpreting
what was probably a form letter .
you shut up .
you shut up .
now you shut up .
you shut up .
oh , are we yelling ? are we yelling right now ?
self @-@ centered ...
yelling ! i &apos;m yelling !
yelling ! i &apos;m yelling , i &apos;m yelling , i &apos;m yelling !
and you &apos;re not talented ! you made me miss my movie !
you made me miss my movie .
in the words of your hacky duck , &quot; what the hell ? &quot;
do you like music ?
everyone likes music .
what are you , a fish ?
i have ... ooh , i @-@ i tell you what we could listen to .
do you know rimples and splikket ?
they were the british laurel and hardy .
most of their stuff is timeless , but you do need to know
that the prime minister went to oxford ,
not cambridge , as the sketch implies .
are they speaking english ?
okay . &apos; 80s german techno it is .
do you have any friends ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
i &apos;ve been defining myself with reactions
to and from other people my whole life .
now i feel worthless just because
i &apos;m worthless in relation to my friends ,
which means they &apos;re not my friends .
who are your friends ?
well , there &apos;s my neighbor , pat .
i try to stay on his good side . i owe him money .
uh , jeff . i &apos;d call you a friend .
well , in fact , i &apos;d call you a ...
oh , that &apos;s right . you and jeff have actually known
each other longer than anybody , huh ?
i always forget that .
i guess &apos; cause you guys don &apos;t really act like friends .
yeah , i guess not so much .
where are we going ?
well , i think you should go home .
because you &apos;re having an existential crisis ,
and the best lesson you could take away from it
is that you are someone , even when you &apos;re by yourself .
i think you &apos;re right . thank you .
and please don &apos;t take offense at this ,
but thank you for not hitting on me .
i was just vulnerable enough to do something really stupid .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . nothing .
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s the ... the stupid steering wheel
is on the wrong side of the car .
what are you doing here ?
i want to show you something .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a script i wrote about a cop on the edge .
troy thought it was hilarious .
i didn &apos;t have the heart to tell him it wasn &apos;t a comedy .
why are you giving this to me ?
i know all the tricks and tropes of filmmaking ,
but what i &apos;m missing is what i think
the critics call &quot; substance , &quot;
which is you more than me .
you want to be film partners ?
&quot; it &apos;s time for justice . police justice . &quot;
wait , the character &apos;s name is &quot; police justice &quot; ?
yeah , i think i may be able to help .
i &apos;m sorry for the stuff i said .
me too .
sit down .
you drink scotch ?
no .
you &apos;re gonna .
hey , handsome . this stool taken ?
struck out , huh ?
if that makes you feel better .
or maybe i just realized that i was spending the whole night
getting to third base with the wrong person .
you &apos;re a good friend ,
and i don &apos;t say that often enough .
that &apos;s really nice .
but you can &apos;t have sex with me .
how about we have these drinks
and then not have sex , with anyone , together ?
sounds good .
cheers .
so a 9 @-@ millimeter &apos;s actually better than a 10 @-@ millimeter ?
millimeter don &apos;t make no difference .
bullets just kinda kill you .
&quot; bullets just kinda kill you . &quot;
are you quoting something ?
can i use that ?
yeah .
you left your handkerchief at my place last night .
we had a boys &apos; night .
a bottle of booze , an argument about sports cars .
and i cut my hand trying to prove that i can whittle .
me too .
oh , hey . how was your night ?
great . i had a monumental evening ...
by myself .
almost feel left out .
well , we &apos;ve had our share of focus lately .
mm @-@ hmm . speak for yourself .
i &apos;m fine . i just , um ...
do you guys believe in ghosts ?
and if you do , do you believe
what those ghosts tell you about other ghosts ?
chang , you cannot be on the committee
if you &apos;re going to be actively insane .
i &apos;m not insane . i swear . i just , um ...
had a weird experience at the theater last night .
you were there ?
yeah , you were there ?
what do you mean ? of course i was .
huh , i guess we just didn &apos;t see you .
well , the ants were people .
the queen ant was an oil company .
what if i don &apos;t exist ?
oh , i got this .
i had a very similar night last night .
go home , light some candles , and take a bath .
okay , coolsies .
hey ! i was thinking off @-@ campus lunch .

i @-@ i won &apos;t go to that tex @-@ mex place .
oh , that &apos;s all i wanted you to say .
