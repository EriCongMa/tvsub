gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
they needed a family member for a blood transfusion ,
and i gave the doctors jack &apos;s number .
jack ?
i told chuck he doesn &apos;t have my heart anymore .
i realized it belongs to someone else .
i &apos;ve always hesitated going after lola &apos;s father
for child support .
do you know who he is ?
i &apos;m looking right at him .
it &apos;s time to pass the &quot; gossip girl &quot; baton .
now be a doll and send this for me .
there &apos;s stuff on this laptop that &apos;ll blow people &apos;s minds .
why did you introduce this girl as your daughter ?
who is she ?
ivy dickens .
your mom hired me to be you .
&quot; as for the rest of my estate , i leave to you , ivy dickens . &quot;
i think it &apos;d be best if you left .
i was just gonna say the same thing .
this is my apartment now .
you know you love me .
dear &quot; s by s &quot; readers ,
it looks like spring has finally sprung ,
and lucky for us , one thing
that hasn &apos;t yet popped up is gossip girl .
hopefully my family &apos;s unfortunate exile to brooklyn
will pass quietly and with dignity .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m perfect as usual ...
and we &apos;ve been waiting weeks , so ...
blair .
oh , god .
i thought you said they were
having breakfast with william .
yes . here .
you &apos;re welcome to join us .
how could i say no ?
帝国酒店
if i had known this was what you meant
when you invited me for a corporate retreat ,
i might have packed differently .
you didn &apos;t need clothes
for mistress katya &apos;s blindfolded trust exercise ,
but i would wear something more suitable
when i thank you officially for saving my life .
what , from that arsonist ,
russell thorpe ?
that was ... a year ago .
took you long enough .
no , no , no , i &apos;m referring to the car accident--
your blood donation ,
after my body rejected the first transfusion ,
and i needed the family member .
oh . that .
well , i wouldn &apos;t be here without you .
i &apos;m eternally grateful .
yeah , well , i considered letting you die
and taking your billions .
that &apos;s probably why you let me
have all the hot ones last night .
my first gift . my second ...
is a bit larger .
i &apos;ve endowed a new wing at the hospital
where i was treated .
it &apos;s going to be the jack bass pavilion .
tonight is the ribbon cutting ceremony for the renovation .
seriously ? you &apos;re not just trying
to get me to the hospital to put me in rehab ?
no , but that said , you might want to
get rid of the evidence of last night &apos;s exploits
before we go .
i &apos;ll sleep it off ...
with ...
you and you . come on .
well , i may have made a few too many waffles ,
but it &apos;s only because it &apos;s great to be back in my old kitchen .
you mean with the stove with the burners
you have to light with a match ?
it &apos;s the quirks-- the little quirks
that make it feel like home .
you know , i never knew that the croissants in brooklyn
rivaled sant ambroeus .
they don &apos;t . i ran up there this morning .
i also stopped by to see vanya , who had some packages for me
and arranged to have , um , serena &apos;s delivered .
it is ludicrous that we have to go to these lengths
to get our own mail .
william , please tell me you found a way to fix this .
well , there &apos;s nothing technically wrong with the will ,
so as executor , my hands are tied .
the law requires that i remain neutral .
lily and i have a meeting with bruce caplan later .
i think it &apos;s best if we get our legal opinions from an expert .
he won &apos;t tell you anything different .
william , what are you even still doing here ?
rufus , william ,
let &apos;s not let ivy drive us apart .
well , sounds like everyone &apos;s got a lot to do today .
i think you should probably get started right away .
blair and i can clean up .
i don &apos;t--
uh ... see ... why
you should all leave immediately ,
because when you are dealing
with a charlatan like ivy dickens ,
time is of the essence .
did you see what lily and serena
said about me today in the paper ?
i don &apos;t read the paper .
not even your boyfriend &apos;s ? &apos; cause that &apos;s where it is .
they said my father &apos;s fatal overdose
sparked my lifetime of criminal behavior .
i &apos;m not a criminal . you know that .
well , a year ago , i might have agreed with you , but now ...
lily has plenty of money .
cece just wanted me to have some , too .
ivy , i really think it would be best
if you stopped calling me , okay ?
lola !
hey , i was just about to call you .
is there any chance i could interview you
for my ivy dickens story ?
i &apos;m sorry , serena .
i &apos;m really not comfortable getting involved .
you already are involved ,
never mind what she did to your family ,
but what she did to you was worst of all .
i mean , she stole your identity .
i really don &apos;t wanna talk about it , okay ?
especially not in the press .
okay . well , if you change your mind .
i swear that wasn &apos;t another botched attempt
to get you two together . she just works here .
i know .
all i wanna do is figure out if i fit into this family ,
but i don &apos;t know how to do that
in the middle of a war with ivy .
well , did you ever call your uncle william back ?
he &apos;s cece &apos;s executor .
she obviously trusted him a lot .
maybe he has some ideas .
yeah , i guess it couldn &apos;t hurt to go ask .
this coffee is probably cold ,
and i &apos;ve just dumped a bunch of my problems in your lap ,
but i swear i came here with good intentions--
a warm beverage and a little moral support
before your big investor meeting .
thanks .
i &apos;m trying , carol ,
but a will is a legal document .
i can &apos;t just overturn it because you &apos;re blackmailing me .
i don &apos;t care what &apos;s legal .
i want my inheritance .
you can pay me out of your pocket if it &apos;s easier .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
i work for a living .
then get ready for serena and eric to hate you
when they find out that you fathered my daughter
while you were married to their mother .
lily will never forgive you , and you know that .
you hired someone to play our daughter to keep it secret .
yes , which should give you some sense of
what i &apos;m willing to do to get my money .
bye ! good luck with the lawyer .
i thought i had a primping problem .
how long does it take two middle @-@ aged people
to leave the apartment ?
at least they &apos;re finally gone .
we need to move fast .
i don &apos;t know how long this meeting &apos;s gonna take .
well , at least our month of failed intimacy attempts
brought to light every possible potential problem .
and i moved the condoms from the dresser to the nightstand--
that &apos;s one i don &apos;t care to relive .
it wasn &apos;t as bad as the time my dad and lily--
twice . three times less than serena
went into our shared bathroom .
yeah , and how does that housekeeper
filling in for dorota not know how to knock ?
we can &apos;t even escape to a proper pied @-@ a @-@ terre in manhattan
until georgina gets me my divorce ,
or my family will have to pay the dowry .
but nothing is in our way now .
not even another unfortunate unzipping incident .
oh , my poor prabal .
wait .
what ?
do you feel that ?
it &apos;s like someone &apos;s watching us .
it &apos;s just cedric .
uh , maybe that &apos;ll stop .
earplugs ? noise @-@ canceling headphones ?
this came for you .
thank you so much .
hey , do you have those numbers for your column ?
i need them for my meeting .
yeah , they &apos;re on my desk .
thanks .
oh , hey , i saw you and lola earlier .
maybe you could take it easy on her
like she asked .
if you don &apos;t mind , i think i &apos;ll determine
how to handle my family .
well , it was just a suggestion .
s. , welcome to your future
as gossip girl 3.0 .
i wouldn &apos;t tell anyone you have this .
trust me , anonymity is key ,
and don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re not intrigued .
we all know there &apos;s only one
upper east side blogger who matters ,
and it &apos;s not s by s .
the power is now in your hands .
your old friend g. , singular .
p.s. keep the password to yourself .
the only recourse you really have
is if you can prove that cece wasn &apos;t of sound mind
when she changed her will .
everyone we spoke with said that your mother &apos;s mind
was sharp to the end , even with the gin .
there &apos;s no other way to get the court
to overturn the will ?
they &apos;ll only grant a hearing and freeze the assets
with evidence of wrongdoing on ivy &apos;s part .
well , she pretended to be my niece .
what could be more wrong than that ?
nothing , if cece had named
charlie rhodes in her will ,
but she left everything to ivy dickens .
cece clearly knew who she really was .
at least we have plenty of money and a great place to live
while we figure this out .
i &apos;m sorry , rufus , but i can &apos;t see a bright side
to a con artist living in my home ,
debasing my mother &apos;s memory .
she did something illegal .
i just have to find it .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m offering to pay you just to show me fabric .
okay .
fine .
having trouble finding a decorator ?
or ... an art consultant or a personal shopper
or anyone from the upper east side to talk to me .
what &apos;s the point of having all this money
if no one will let me spend it ?
well , perhaps i can be of assistance .
for a percentage of that money , of course .
i &apos;d pay anything to get lily and serena
to stop blackballing me .
all you have to do is throw a party .
why ? no one will come .
they &apos;ll have no choice if it &apos;s a benefit to honor
the celia rhodes cancer foundation .
i &apos;ll see to that ...
for a healthy fee .
you just can &apos;t let anybody know that it was my idea .
you &apos;ve done a great job
building up a full @-@ fledged news source ,
but with so many other media options ,
what sets you apart
to compete long term ?
well , we don &apos;t just follow the news .
we &apos;re the people involved in it ,
so we get the stories and perspectives
that no one else has access to .
isn &apos;t that serena van der woodsen ?
i &apos;ve seen her in the society pages .
exactly my point .
serena . this is james mackenzie .
he &apos;s considering becoming our new financial partner .
oh . it &apos;s a pleasure .
serena &apos;s blog is one of &quot; the spectator &apos;s &quot; biggest draws .
i &apos;m just writing a story right now on ivy dickens .
that &apos;s the woman who inherited everything
from your grandmother . i read about her .
like i said , serena &apos;s writing from the inside .
she &apos;s our generation &apos;s dominick dunne .
i can &apos;t wait to read it .
nate , you can expect an official offer by tonight .
thank you , james . i look forward to working with you .
i &apos;ll see myself out .
i hope he means it .
his offer is the only one with the money we need .
so thank you .
i think your ivy expose helped close the deal .
is that the story ?
oh . gossip girl &apos;s back ?
i think so . i don &apos;t know .
i was just , looking up some stuff on ivy ,
but there is a new post .
do you know
she &apos;s throwing a party tonight in cece &apos;s honor ?
i can &apos;t believe this girl . she has no shame .
that we knew .
strange i didn &apos;t get the blast yet .
i figured she was still on vacation , whatever that means .
yeah . i @-@ i just got it now , so i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll get it soon .
well , let me know what you find on ivy .
i &apos;m gonna go see how we &apos;re doing
on that jack @-@ bass @-@ saving @-@ chuck story .
there was no answer in dr. van der woodsen &apos;s room ,
so i was wondering if i could leave a message .
oh . actually , never mind .
lily just rsvp &apos;d she &apos;s coming .
the plan &apos;s working .
and thanks for helping me with the caterer .
you can keep the &quot; thank yous , &quot;
but i &apos;ll take that check you offered .
i still haven &apos;t heard from serena .
well , that wasn &apos;t part of our agreement .
look , i &apos;ve lived here long enough to know
not to write a check until they actually show up .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
if i have to be sober tonight , shouldn &apos;t you ?
i just had an interesting conversation with nate .
it &apos;s about time he confessed his true feelings for you .
&quot; the spectator &quot; is doing a story
on the hospital dedication tonight ,
and his reporter did some research on you .
well , if she &apos;s having a coronary reading about my history ,
then i can help her . i &apos;m about to have my own hospital wing .
incredibly , it wasn &apos;t your fondness
of the beer bath at chodovar
or your restraining orders that caught her eye .
it was your time at eton .
it &apos;s an english boarding school .
everyone tries it .
schoolboy exploits aside ,
spending more than 3 months in the u.k. from 1980 to 1996
1980到1996年间在英国停留三个月以上者献血
prohibits you from donating blood in this country .
didn &apos;t they ask you about that ?
yeah . they also asked me if i ever used drugs
or slept with prostitutes .
i told them what they wanted to hear
so i could save your life .
right .
i should &apos;ve known better
than to expect you to play by the rules .
it &apos;s the only way i &apos;m predictable .
i should get to the hospital ,
make sure everything &apos;s ready for tonight .
i &apos;ll see you there .
i &apos;ll just drink enough to behave normally .
how &apos;d your meeting go ?
i should have the official offer tonight .
oh , that &apos;s great . congratulations .
thanks . you &apos;re a good actress ,
but that smile doesn &apos;t look real .
what &apos;s wrong ?
not to sound tacky ,
but can i ask you a rich person question ?
i put my extensive knowledge of privilege
fully at your disposal .
well , when i went to go see william ,
i ended up overhearing ivy offering him money .
he &apos;s the executor of cece &apos;s will ,
so that &apos;s sketchy , right ?
a beneficiary is not allowed to reward an executor .
it would call the entire inheritance into question
if he was working for her .
do you think william would really do that
to his family , though ?
well , william &apos;s history isn &apos;t exactly pristine .
he &apos;s been known to con people and so is ivy .
i mean , this would be grounds
to contest the will in court .
i think you have to tell serena .
i have to think about it .
and i have to get to class , too .
let &apos;s just keep this between us for now , okay ?
yeah . okay .
let me guess . you &apos;re redecorating .
i know that the jewelry mother left me
is here somewhere .
i can &apos;t believe i have to go to a benefit for my mother
as a guest at my home .
you sure you don &apos;t want me there for moral support ?
no , you &apos;ve so been looking forward
to this magnetic field &apos;s concert , and let &apos;s be honest .
i fake a happy face better than you do .
i just wanted to wear something of cece &apos;s .
to remind everyone who her true daughter really is .
will , this necklace work ?
it &apos;s perfect .
thank you .
i know how hard this has been , lily .
so if it helps ,
i decided to buy us a little privacy .
you reconsidered about the hotel ?
well , just for tonight , to start .
oh , that &apos;s great , and then once
we realize it &apos;s easier ,
we can always extend .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna pack .
no . you don &apos;t need any more stress .
that &apos;s why i got the room for dan .
i should take this for the loft .
i don &apos;t know how i didn &apos;t think of that sooner .
and us entering separately eliminated the threat
of anyone seeing us together .
alas , no car alarms .
there &apos;s no construction .
no friends , no housekeepers , or family to interrupt .
i think i forgot the champagne at your place .
we don &apos;t need it ... or this conversation .
let &apos;s hope good flings come to those who wait .
yeah . my words exactly .
well , it was only one word .
one &apos;s all you need , really .
yeah .
well , i would love to stay for seconds , but
i should really get back home
and make sure that fake dorota
doesn &apos;t put my lemaire cashmere in the washer again .
well , it &apos;s understandable .
well , i @-@ i mean , anyway , we &apos;re both
going to that horrible ivy thing tonight , right ?
i mean , that &apos;s the only reason
why we had to finish in such a timely fashion .
yeah , family obligations are important .
right . well
i &apos;ll see you over tacky aperitifs .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. bass . there must be a misspelling
or a glitch in the system .
i can &apos;t find your file .
all my records are missing ?
i was on duty the night of your accident ,
but the only bass that came up in my search is first name jack .
oh , his records are fine , too , actually .
except i &apos;m not allowed to show you
another patient &apos;s information .
of course . i &apos;m just trying to find out some specifics
about his blood donation that saved my life .
i was hoping to mention them when i dedicate
the new wing in his honor .
he &apos;s the one who gave you blood ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t discuss someone else &apos;s chart .
so i &apos;ll stop asking you , too .
could you let director brancolini know that i &apos;m here ?
i &apos;d like to speak with him before the ceremony .
my pleasure .
i don &apos;t understand .

if lola saw my dad take money from ivy ,
then why didn &apos;t she tell me herself ?
you know this is complicated for her .
i just thought you deserved to know ,
and this way , lola doesn &apos;t have to be
in the middle of anything .
oh , yeah , but instead she &apos;ll just accuse my dad of taking bribes .
look , he would never do something like that .
lola just must have heard wrong .
i don &apos;t think she did , but don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not gonna write anything until i confirm it .
you &apos;re not gonna write anything ?
what are you talking about ?
this is my article .
you &apos;re too close , serena . i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t take a chance on the article that hooked mackenzie .
hey , dad . i @-@ i &apos;m so glad it &apos;s you .
i wanted to ask you something .
great .
let &apos;s chat at ivy dickens &apos; party tonight .
i wasn &apos;t planning on going to that .
why on earth are you ?
i know how you feel about her ,
but it is a benefit to honor your grandmother .
i felt we should all be there as a family .
okay . you know what , dad ?
i guess you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll be there at 7 : 30 .
great . all right , love .
serena &apos;s coming .
all we need now is for ivy to write that check .
yes , our proof she &apos;s engaging in illegal activity .
the court will have to agree to hear our case .
艾薇似乎被她所剩无几的良心彻底摒弃了
ticktock , upper east siders .
this time bomb is about to send ivy &apos;s party up in smoke .
i thought it was crank call
when you say that you come to queens .
why ? you know my manners are impeccable ,
even if it means crossing into unsavory areas
to give you a baby gift .
you weren &apos;t there to wrap it , so
this is re @-@ gift from your wedding to prince ,
not present for leo .
well , everyone brings the child a gift ,
but no one needs champagne more than a new mother .
you must have something to break these in with .
this will do .
hey , i &apos;ll be here . thanks .
hey , man . i was just in the neighborhood .
thought i &apos;d stop by to see if you , uh ,
you wanted to grab a drink or ... you know what ?
we could just drink here .
i figure you must have something ,
unless you haven &apos;t honored our &quot; be like don draper &quot; pact .
does this sudden onset alcoholism have something to do with blair ?
no . uh , blair &apos;s great .
it &apos;s perfectly normal for a new relationship
to need time to find its , uh , its groove .
the sex was bad , wasn &apos;t it ?
it happened to you , too ? it must be her , then .
that makes me feel a lot better .
now that you drink , spill .
what mr. lonely boy do ?
don &apos;t tell me the anatomical reason he always so lonely ?
dorota ! no !
everything was ... physically appealing ,
but the problem wasn &apos;t the man . it was the deed .
you see , i didn &apos;t have any technical difficulties .
it was just ... inexplicably terrible .
hmm , sounds like a classic case of the dan humphrey overthink .
all right , so what if after the build @-@ up ,
that aspect of the relationship doesn &apos;t work ?
maybe he nervous .
what he say when you tell him sex only so @-@ so ?
well , what did blair say about it ?
nothing at all .
oh , you mean after you lied and told her how great it was ?
honesty is your only shot at making this any better .
well , it would &apos;ve been impolite ,
and i didn &apos;t want to upset him .
upset is only the beginning if you say nothing .
it take honest communication to turn vanya
from boy to man in bedroom .
i &apos;m gonna need another drink to forget i just heard that .
you need to go talk to her .
okay . just after one more drink .
you &apos;re looking for answer in wrong borough .
you need to talk to mr. lonely boy .
fine . but i &apos;m gonna need a stronger buzz
to enter ivy &apos;s party .
we &apos;re only good friends .
wine ?
red wine at a cocktail party .
excuse me .
why ? what &apos;s wrong with it ?
well , you don &apos;t serve red
when people are moving around .
if they were to spill ...
well , i trust my guests , including you .
thank you for coming .
yes , well , you know quite well that
i would not miss a chance to honor my mother .
i miss her , too .
i know she would want us to be close ,
so i was hoping we could respect her wishes
by talking again .
we used to have such a wonderful relationship .
yes , yes , under , uh , false pretenses .
then let this be our fresh start .
um , excuse me .
could we have a picture , please ?
for cece .

since when do ribbon cuttings involve crippled kids ?
i wouldn &apos;t call him crippled to his face .
sorry , kid , but let &apos;s face it .
you &apos;re crippled .
michael , meet jack .
don &apos;t touch me .
after hearing about his brave battle with leukemia ,
i decided a blood drive would be
a much better symbol of your heroism
than a simple ribbon cutting .
well , another needle in the arm
doesn &apos;t sound like a celebration ,
unless it &apos;s putting something in .
we can celebrate properly later . he &apos;s ready .
okay , you know i can &apos;t give that kid my blood , so ...
go away .
thank you , michael .
tell your agent the check &apos;s in the mail .
you played me with a fake kid ?
no , the kid &apos;s real . he &apos;s just not sick .
but you are-- with hepatitis .
since i don &apos;t have it , i know you didn &apos;t give me blood .
it &apos;s the only way i could get you to admit it .
so i guess this is the end of the jack bass wing .
well , we can discuss that after you tell me the truth .
looks like you &apos;re having a stellar debut .
which means i did my job .
yes . thank you .
and i will write you that check
just after i talk to lauren san domingo .
i can &apos;t believe she came .
hey . how you holding up ?
well , seeing our home taken over by
florida trash is torture ,
but i &apos;m taking it in stride .
it &apos;ll all be over soon .
she offered your father a bribe .
how do you know that ?
well , william told me right after she did it .
luckily , he thought quickly and he accepted ,
knowing it was the ammunition we need
to take her case to court .
he &apos;ll likely be removed as executor ,
but he &apos;s willing to make that sacrifice for us .
mom , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s amazing ,
but what are you waiting for ?
ivy hasn &apos;t written your father a check yet .
hopefully it &apos;ll be any minute .
now look , i know how much you dislike her ,
but don &apos;t say anything yet .
we don &apos;t wanna spook her .
that &apos;s just what i was thinking .
you know , i just realized i have an 8 : 00 deadline .
um , i hope she didn &apos;t pack up my old computer .
excuse me . oh , serena .
hi , mr. cavett .
oh , you look like a million bucks before taxes .
oh , thank you .
as the late bob hope would say ...
oh , seriously , though , i was so sorry
to hear about your grandmother &apos;s passing .
she was such a-- how would you say--
such a--such an original woman , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
oh , yes . well , thank you .
dan .
blair , hey .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m , um ... same as you .
i &apos;m just going to-- going to the party .
so let &apos;s go up ,
instead of staying here and talking
&apos;cause there &apos;s ... nothing to talk about .
yeah . i agree . there &apos;s nothing at all .
i hope she has a full bar .
yeah . mm , me , too .
oh , serena , go easier on me in your column from now on .
oh , you gotta stop being so scandalous .
look , i can &apos;t miss this deadline . take care .
oh , serena , i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
now &apos;s not a good time .
it &apos;s about ivy .
i would love to talk about her ,
but i just have to do something before 8 : 00 .
you can steal money ,
but you can &apos;t steal class .
looks like ivy &apos;s poisoned what little remained
of her good will .
last i heard , it was illegal to bribe an executor .
that &apos;s what i wanted to tell you .
i guess gossip girl got to it first .
and ruined everything .
i should have known you only came to humiliate me
with more of your lies .
i didn &apos;t bribe william .
you tried .
you said you &apos;d pay me to get people to attend this party .
because you offered .
this is just all a setup .
the only setup here is
whatever you did to manipulate my mother .
you have no proof i did anything wrong .
you &apos;d kick me out of this house , and you can &apos;t .
i should have never had you back .
please , you have to tell everyone
that you saw ivy offer to pay my father .
you &apos;re the only proof we have .
i don &apos;t know , serena .
from what i saw , it looked like william was in on it .
he only agreed to take the money
to prove that ivy was defrauding people .
i didn &apos;t know his plan either .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m the one that sent the tip in
to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
now you &apos;re the only one who can fix what i screwed up .
this is your chance to help our family .
oh , stop saying &quot; our &quot;
i still don &apos;t know
if i wanna be part of this family .
is that really how you feel ?
or how your mother wants you to ?
&apos;cause she kept you from us your entire life .
she lied to you because she didn &apos;t want anyone else
to love you , not to mention ,
she never even told you
who your father was .
what does my father have to do with this ?
because without him and without her ,
we &apos;re the only family you have left .
and we really need you .
this elevator is so slow .
feels like it &apos;s not even moving .
did you push the button ?
i thought you did it .
ah , you are wasted .
this elevator smells like vodka .
vodka doesn &apos;t smell , and ...
you are drunker than i am .
and i can tell by the fact that you &apos;re not hyper @-@ verbal
that you are avoiding something .
well , i can tell by the fact that you drank vodka
that you are , too .
you first .
fine . fine .
i wasn &apos;t 100 % honest with you today .
me neither .
that &quot; wow &quot; really meant
&quot; wow , that was terrible . &quot;
and it was just--it was ... mind @-@ numbingly boring .
与51岁男性道格 · 休切逊结婚 最近在facebook爆性感照
like the least sexy thing since courtney stodden .
yeah , i mean , i don &apos;t know who that is ,
but it &apos;s much worse .
oh , so what--what are ...
is our chemistry just purely intellectual ?
is it only in our heads ?
apparently .
but before we , uh , we--we break up ,
i just wanna let you know that you were really , really good
in my head .
i am really , really good out of it , too .
no . i don &apos;t think so .
hey , i will prove it to you .
right--right here in this elevator ?
but people have to go ... up and down .
mm , yes , they do .
i &apos;d like to think my night with pamela anderson
was worth it , but it hasn &apos;t seemed to slow me down .
i like to think of myself as the magic johnson of hep @-@ c.
why didn &apos;t you just tell me the truth ?
and give up a hospital wing in my name ?
we both know if you wanted one ,
you &apos;d just buy one .
you &apos;re covering for who really gave me the blood--
elizabeth .
she didn &apos;t want you to know ,
especially , well , after she told you
she wasn &apos;t your mother .
well , i guess this proves otherwise once and for all .
i &apos;d like to thank her .
she &apos;s unreachable .
i mean , just refer to your previous 20 years on earth .
let it be .
does it matter why you &apos;re alive ?
the fact is , you are .
this weekend did remind me
how much i value all my senses .
we &apos;re all the family we need .
let &apos;s do this again .
my turf next time .
do i need to call security to escort you out ?
we &apos;re just waiting for the elevator , okay ?
and we &apos;ll be back . this is our home .
not anymore .
tonight made me see
why cece left it all to me .
you &apos;re so selfish that you couldn &apos;t
even honor her for an hour .
i cared about her .
all you care about is ruining me with your lies .
it &apos;s not a lie .
lola .
i heard you offering to pay william myself .
that &apos;s exactly the proof we need .
no , it &apos;s not .
they &apos;re setting me up .
you know i wouldn &apos;t do that .
all i know is what i saw , ivy .
i &apos;ll have my lawyers start proceedings
to contest the will immediately .
go ahead .
you don &apos;t have a case .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
the court will decide that .
in the meantime , your assets will be frozen .
thank you for coming forward .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking their side .
i mean , they &apos;re just using you .
and when they &apos;re done , they &apos;ll throw you out
just like they did me .
no , they won &apos;t .
they &apos;re my family .
looks like lola &apos;s untangled some knots
to form family ties .
well , this just proves sometimes
you gotta throw away the first pancake .
i don &apos;t know how breakfast food
has anything to do with this , but obviously ,
this afternoon was an anomaly .
where to ?
rufus and lily are definitely gonna come back to the loft
at some point .
mm , serena will be at my place .
i still have that hotel room .
to be haunted by the ghost of bad sex past ?
you two lovebirds going somewhere or not ?
i need another drink .
all right . uh , take us to williamsburg , please .
there &apos;s a place there .
it &apos;s got about 300 whiskeys .
and hopefully a clean bathroom we can use .
thanks again for coming forward up there .
it &apos;s the least i can do
after thinking you were conspiring with ivy .
sorry about that .
it &apos;s hard to know what to think
when no one &apos;s told you the whole story .
seriously . no one &apos;s ever told me my whole story .
i used to know your mother pretty well .
and if she &apos;s concealing things from you ,
then it &apos;s ...
probably only to protect you .
protect me ?
how did it protect me to grow up alone
with no family but her ?
talk to your mom .
forgive her .
i messed things up so badly with serena and eric ,
that it took a long time to rebuild the relationship ,
and they found a place in their hearts to forgive me ,
but ... i would never
do anything ever again to lose them .
i know . parents are human .
everybody makes mistakes .
what if my dad doesn &apos;t even know i exist ?
what if all he &apos;d want is to know me ?
i &apos;m sure he does .
here &apos;s your cab . you catch this one , okay ?
i &apos;ll catch the next .
thank you .
good night .
hey . i got your text .
what &apos;s so important i had to come into the office tonight ?
&quot; the spectator &apos;s &quot; entire future .
what are you talking about ?
mr. mackenzie saw the story about ivy
you obviously sent in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
you knew i hooked him with our exclusive access .
he said if i couldn &apos;t deliver on that ,
he couldn &apos;t trust me to deliver on the big things either .
he backed out , serena .
i &apos;m sorry , nate .
i @-@ i just wanted to help my family ,
and you wouldn &apos;t let me put it on &quot; the spectator . &quot;
yeah , well , that &apos;s all well and good ,
but you &apos;re fired .
a @-@ are you kidding me ?
none of this would have happened
if you hadn &apos;t taken the story away from me .
yeah , and i was right not to trust you with it
or anything else .
now i have to go try and save the jobs
of the people who still work here .
spring is the season of rebirth--
a time for change ...
a time to blossom .
i know it &apos;s a victory ,
but what if ivy pulls an anna nicole smith
and takes it to the supreme court ?
this could take years .
maybe we should look for another place .
we have another place .
no , i mean a more permanent home .
took me a while to get used to the upper east side , too .
but there are always late bloomers .
do you take credit cards ?
sorry , miss , we don &apos;t .
and some buds are nipped before they can grow .
that japanese whisky went so well with croque monsieur .
i told you . great things grow in brooklyn .
well , now we have the problem
of where do we go from here ?
uh ... here looks pretty good .
what ?
new relationships flourish and take on new form ...
andrew , you remember the woman with the locket
i had you look for a couple years ago ?
elizabeth fisher ?
yeah , my mother .
i need to find her again .
while old relationships can be re @-@ examined .
i just left chuck . he knows it wasn &apos;t my blood .
i think you should come back and handle it yourself .
but some things never change .
this is the upper east side , in case you forgot .
before you say anything ,
i &apos;m sorry that i told serena what you saw .
i wanted an honest relationship ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have betrayed your trust .
thanks . i &apos;m just glad everything &apos;s on the table now .
i don &apos;t wanna move , but i know it &apos;s my lawyer .
all right , please tell me we have an offer
that &apos;ll at least keep &quot; the spectator &quot; afloat .
yes , i , uh , i do know diana payne .
i read your blog ,
and while you do a pretty good me ,
you &apos;re not the real deal .
so if you &apos;ll just hand over the password ,
i &apos;d like my site back .
