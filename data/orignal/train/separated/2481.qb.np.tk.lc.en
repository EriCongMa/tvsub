第二十五季第九集
oh , boy .
monday morning chit @-@ chat at the water cooler .
the only reason to have done stuff over the weekend .
the only part of the movie i didn &apos;t get is :
now radioactive man gets his powers from his suit ?
the suit is slowly killing him ,
but if he doesn &apos;t wear it , he &apos;ll die .
wait , you guys saw the new radioactive man sequel ?
uh , it &apos;s not a sequel , it &apos;s a reboot .
actually , this one undoes the stuff
from the last one , so it &apos;s a de @-@ boot .
stop talking ! i haven &apos;t seen it yet !
radioactive man re @-@ rises came out three days ago .
it is fair game .
yeah , if you haven &apos;t seen it ,
then you gotta leave the water cooler .
but what if i want some cooled water ?
you should have thought of that
when you were not seeing the movie .
fine . i &apos;ll drink alone .
it was so awesome when radioactive man
had to erase his own memory .
yeah , so he wouldn &apos;t be tortured by his past
when he was born in the future .
oh , they &apos;re talking about the movie !
hurry up , you idiot !
no , no , don &apos;t stop !
i &apos;m sorry i got mad .
i &apos;ll do that thing you like .
i got radioactive man &apos;s new villain ...
the collider .
i turn out to be a good guy .
i die , but come back to life after the credits .
开玩笑呢
sometimes we feel
there &apos;s nowhere left to turn , much like radioactive man ,
when he had to kill his own antimatter twin .
with a blast of time particles from the chrono @-@ cube
amazing grace
how loud i sing ...
and in doing so , mortally wounding ...
to drown the spoilers out !
... his girlfriend , who was pregnant with his own ...
shut up , shut up , shut ...
and stay out !
okay . i gotta go see the radioactive man movie
before it gets totally ruined for me .
ooh , date night !
i &apos;ll go change my bra .
i want to see radioactive man re @-@ rises .
if bart &apos;s going , i &apos;m going !
if grampa &apos;s going , i &apos;m going !
if you all go , then i have to pay for a babysitter .
we &apos;ll call that nice girl
who &apos;s getting her masters in child development .
emily beth ?
we can &apos;t afford emily beth !
she brings her own puppets !

《 辐射英雄 : 东山再起 》
two adults , two kids ,

if i wanted to pay for commercials i can &apos;t skip ,
i &apos;d sign up for hulu plus !
you &apos;re shushing me ?
this guy &apos;s on his cell phone ,
she &apos;s texting , he &apos;s sexting ,
and that guy brought a baby to a 9 : 00 movie !
that &apos;s negative , man .
what happened to the movies ?
first they got worse than tv , and now this !
and stay out !
chins up , homer .
you don &apos;t need a theater to watch the movie .
you just have to illegally download it .
illegally download it ?
is that legal ?
who knows ? but it sure is easy .
i &apos;ll walk you through it .
all you have to do is ...
the fox network forbids
the broadcast of step @-@ by @-@ step instructions
for illegally downloading
copyrighted intellectual property .
in the meantime , please enjoy this footage
from nascar &apos;s 2011 martinsville cup .
wow , that was easy .
all i had to do was click on ...
and play !
bless you , boy .
that was the greatest thing i &apos;ve seen on a computer
that i can talk about with you in the room .
how did you know how to do that ?
i &apos;m under 30 .
guys , guys , i saw the radioactive man movie !
here &apos;s my ten favorite scenes from worst to best .
number ten : when what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name did that stuff with those dudes .
number nine ...
uh , homer , that movie &apos;s been talked out .
we &apos;re discussing the new james bond flick .
i like that james bond is ugly now .
i like that he doesn &apos;t have any gadgets .
i like that he &apos;s not good at shooting ,
doesn &apos;t say funny quips ,
or do any james bond stuff .
shut up , shut up , shut up !
homer , go to the theater and see the movie .
theaters ?
all i need to see this movie
is a laptop and a web site based in a country
that &apos;s really just an offshore oil platform .
care to join me ?
that was so much better than the cinema .
it mixes the wonder of movie @-@ going
with the rush of stealing .
all we want is brand @-@ new , big budget entertainment
in our homes for nothin &apos; .
why doesn &apos;t hollywood get that ?
gentlemen , i am inspired
to create a theater for the people ...
an experience free of all the nuisances
and gouging of modern @-@ day moviegoing !
yeah , no more jerks talking on their cell phones !
no more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone !
and best of all ...
we &apos;ll never have to sit through
another annoying commercial again !
welcome to &quot; cinema pirate @-@ diso . &quot;
tonight &apos;s movie is life is funny ,
directed by judd apatow .
it &apos;s based on his life , starring his family
and ad @-@ libbed by his friends .
so for the next three and a half hours , enjoy !
did you just pass gas while we were making love ?
you &apos;re the one who hired the korean taco truck
for our private school fund @-@ raiser .
i live it , he writes it .
well , what did you think ?
we may be going to hell for seeing &quot; side bosom , &quot;
but this backyard is a little slice of heaven ,
all thanks to homer simpson !
this is fun !
and it was so nice of the movie company
to let you show their film .
let me ? uh , sweetheart ,
i downloaded it off the internet ...
illegally .
an illegal download ?
but hollywood says stealing from hollywood is wrong .
why should a regular guy like me
have to spend 15 bucks a ticket
so studios can pay huge salaries
《 神犬也疯狂 》 中狗爸爸的名字
to the air buds and ray liottas of the world ?
when i watched that pirated movie ,
i was stealing with my eyes .
so i &apos;m repaying the good people in hollywood
for the ticket i should have bought .

对种子说不
you people joined this squad for one reason :
to fight movie pirates .
i wanted to catch serial killers .
i wanted to catch serial killers .
from now on , you will lay down your lives
to protect america &apos;s chick flicks , buddy comedies
and steady stream of animated misfires .
sir , you have to see this .
&quot; took it off the web ...
watched for free ...
never pay for a movie again &quot; ?
men , set your guns on &quot; kill . &quot;
we &apos;re going after homer simpson .
i now present ,
direct from the computer of an angry editor
at a special effects house ,
cosmic wars episode seven .
my childhood has been un @-@ ruined !
listen up , seat meat !
you are all in violation of
title 17 of the u.s. copyright code .
easy there , hotshot .
all the people are doing is watching a movie .
i &apos;m not wearing an undershirt
and my badge is poking into my skin .
what &apos;s going on here ?
is there a fondler in the neighborhood ?
i &apos;m here to arrest
and hopefully stage the prison suicide
of the mastermind of this operation--
homer simpson !
ooh , mastermind .
we got our man , thanks to a tip
from a heroic american snitch .
one of you turned me in ?
who was it ?
you !
superintendent chalmers ,
you never forgave me for that time
we wore the same hawaiian shirt to that luau !
they &apos;re gonna take dad !
we gotta do something !
i &apos;m on it .
copyrighted material !
don &apos;t look at it !
someone sell me a ticket !
ear plugs in ! blinders on !
we trained for this !
from now on ,
the only place you &apos;ll be watching movies
without having to buy a ticket is jail .
baby , promise me
you &apos;ll find out who turned me in .
it &apos;s probably someone i would never suspect .
never suspect .
your moans of sympathy are all i have .
whoever did this to me will be haunted
by unbearable guilt forever !
forever !
what are you guys in for ?
bank robbery .
drug trafficking .
what about you ?
movie piracy .
what ? !
people in show business
work hard to make those movies .
my media stocks under @-@ performed because of people like you .
my brother lost his job as a grip
on a movie set because of piracy .
he had to sell his jet ski .
a grip without a jet ski ain &apos;t no grip at all !
you &apos;re about to find out
what we do to copyright infringers .
it &apos;s almost like having dad here .
only with less growling when i go near his food .
i just want to know who dropped the dime on dad .
lousy rat .
maybe the person that turned your father in
thought they were doing the right thing .
homer just pirated a movie .
but it &apos;s not the worst thing dad ever did .
it &apos;s not even the worst kind of pirate dad &apos;s ever been .
lisa , tell your brother
that stealing is wrong , no matter what .
i don &apos;t know .
it wasn &apos;t like dad was stealing for himself .
he created this wonderful experience for the whole town .
i just can &apos;t imagine anyone turning him in .
dad , dad , you &apos;re back , you &apos;re back ! hey !
homer , what are you doing out of prison ?
you have to go back and give yourself up .
i can &apos;t go back to jail !
there &apos;s no shampoo , just soap !
wait , i know one place in springfield
that doesn &apos;t care about internet piracy laws .
thanks for taking us in .
our family always appreciates asylum .
this consulate is like being on swedish soil .
you &apos;re as safe here as you would be in the skatteskrapan .
your country doesn &apos;t think illegally
downloading movies is wrong ?
the people of sweden believe
all movies should be shared freely .
how is that not stealing ?
bah , your hollywood studios are the real thieves ,
claiming all their hit movies have lost money .
i spit on their bookkeeping .
yeah , and why don &apos;t they make a sequel to taken
where the hangover guys get taken
and the only ones that could rescue them
is fast and furious .
aw , man , i would love to pirate that .
as would the proud people of sweden .
they &apos;ve found us !
there &apos;s only one surefire way to get fugitives
out of a foreign building--
blasting death metal .
* respecting the law , respecting the law *
* copyright law , copyright law *
* copyright law , copyright law ... *
you like this ?
oh @-@ oh , swedes love death metal .
it reminds us of death .
damn those peace prize @-@ giving fish @-@ smokers .
i &apos;m so tired of being trapped in this embassy .
consulate .
consulates are regional offices ,
which serve the embassy in the capitol .
thank you so much for sticking with me
through all this .
you &apos;re the greatest wife in the world .
it was me !
i was the one who told the fbi .
you ?
how could you ?
you &apos;re my own flesh and blood .
i was just trying to do the right thing .
who would &apos;ve thought the authorities
would use a confession against me ?
have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding ?
to love and cherish ?
to aid and abet ?
i never wanted to say funny vows .
well , you did ! and they got laughs .
solid laughs !
i didn &apos;t mean for this to happen ,
but you were stealing .
all i ever had was you looking out for me .
i got nothing now .
all rise in the matter of the people vs. homer simpson .
the people call hollywood ultra @-@ producer , judd apatow .
homer simpson is an enemy of art .
art created by writers , directors ,
and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples .
and not just the people who dream for a living ,
but the people who depend on us .
the spin class instructors ,
the personal rabbis , seth rogen .
it &apos;s true , i need him .
i saw a bootleg dvd of the 40 year old virgin
for sale at a car wash .
they left off my director &apos;s commentary !
it didn &apos;t even have a blooper reel !

homer simpson , you have been found guilty
of illegal reproduction and distribution
of copyrighted material .
before sentencing , do you have anything to say for yourself ?
no .
homer , tell them your side of the story .
i know i hurt you , but please trust me now .
it &apos;ll work .
you know what , judge apatow ?
i do have something to say .
these movie people may say i &apos;m a pirate ,
but i &apos;m just a man .
a man who loved hollywood too much .
so i made my own rules and fought the big guys
who tried to destroy my way of life .
he doesn &apos;t sound like a villain .
he sounds like a classic underdog .
he &apos;s the unlikeliest of heroes !
but where &apos;s the love story ?
at first my wife didn &apos;t believe in me .
maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place .
but when times seemed darkest , one minute ago ,
she was there and gave me the strength and courage
to fight for what i believe in .
he &apos;s a downloading david versus a greedy goliath .
an erin brockovich but with more cleavage !
two , three ...
good lord , he &apos;s hitting all four quadrants !

one family , against all odds , took on the system ...
and lost .
mr. simpson , i &apos;d like to buy the rights to make a movie
based on your true story .
i &apos;m attached as executive producer !
attached ! attached !
one movie ? we envision a trilogy .
will smith &apos;s family wants to play your family .
i &apos;d be jaden .
on behalf of hollywood ,
we are dropping all charges .
these people hate my dad .
how can they want to make a movie about him ?
hollywood may be run by big corporations
trying to squash people , but they make movies
about people standing up to big corporations
trying to squash them and winning .
i &apos;ll sign with whoever can convince channing tatum
to gain the most weight to play me .
他唯一的罪只是触犯了法律
surprise ! - surprise ! surprise !
what the hell is all this ?
we &apos;re so excited about your movie
that we &apos;re having a special screening .
but the movie isn &apos;t in theaters till next week .
yeah , we ripped a version off bootleg bay
just like you taught us .
it &apos;s still got timecode on it ,
but , otherwise , it &apos;s a clean copy .
you &apos;re pirating my movie ?
the hell you are ! piracy is stealing !
you &apos;re taking money out of my family &apos;s mouths !
but the movie is ... i @-@ it &apos;s about you pirating movies .
oh , that &apos;s hollywood fantasy .
we live in the real world , where i have something called ...
prof @-@ it par @-@ tic @-@ i @-@ pa @-@ tion .
that &apos;s negative , man .
oh , homie ...
now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens !
no bargain matinees !
and tell your friends it was great !
buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it !
homer in the movie wears ask body spray
and so should you !
don &apos;t ask ! do smell !
homie , do you really think you should be ...
up @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup !
what have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband ?
ask body spray !
无需开口 效果立现
激流勇进
but then when times seemed darkest ,
she was there ; she gave me the strength and courage
to fight for what i believe in .
on behalf of hollywood ,
we &apos;re dropping all charges !
so what do you think , lise ? who are the good guys here ,
the media companies or the internet freedom guys ?
well , both groups claim their intentions are noble ,
but at the end of the day , they &apos;re both trying to steal
as much money as they can .
so ... everyone &apos;s a pirate ?
and the worst one of all is ...
