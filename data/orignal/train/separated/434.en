Didn't come out here to play games!
Bus is leaving in 5 minutes.
Get your gear or it stays.
You're out here 6 days, boys.
Had a chance to prove yourselves.
And what have you done?
Showed me you're a bunch of lazy sons of bitches.
I got your message.
Good. What do you think?
It presents as mass suicide.
Can you prove it?
Not without visiting the campus.
That's what I thought.
I can't make an assessment without meeting the faculty and students.
I know. It--
The school is up for the Federal Tomlinson Grant.
This does not bode well.
The director's a graduate of Somerville Academy, isn't he?
Yes. And he's been fighting for the government funding.
These boys killed themselves for a reason.
No one should write that off.
I'm not asking you to.
Somerville Military Academy, Oceanside, Florida,
5 boys were found hanging this morning.
The bodies are at the medical examiner's now.
There's no photos?
School personnel thought they may be still alive, so they cut them out of the trees.
Jimmy Burbage, Phil Mumford,
Jerry Bowden, Jack Briggs, Tucker Calhoun.
So we're walking into a contaminated crime scene.
We don't have anything solid?
"We're sorry" was carved in a tree branch nearby.
This happened on campus?
No, in the woods about an hour away.
How long were they out there?
6 days.
Without supervision?
It was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen.
What drove them to suicide?
A freshman cadet, Bailey Shelton,
Hung himself 2 weeks ago in his room.
Identical bed sheet, hangman's knot.
Who takes sheets camping?
They would if it was the plan.
Could be domino effect.
The campus would have been on high alert after the first one,
So the kids wait until they're alone in the woods.
They must have made some kind of pact.
And there's something else.
6 kids went on the trip. Only 5 were found.
The school officials confirm that Josh Redding is still missing.
So maybe he chickened out of the pact.
Or was never a part of it.
And the campus is completely off the grid. No internet.
I can help with that.
Which is why you're coming with us.
And so am I.
Isn't Somerville the director's alma mater?
Yes. The academy has enjoyed a spotless reputation,
So the hope is to keep the investigation in house.
I imagine there's a lot of concern for Josh.
He's been in those woods almost a week.
So how's he surviving?
"Things do not change. We change."
Henry David Thoreau.
There's still no sign of Josh Redding.
We'll join the search.
So, the Somerville Academy was founded
During World War II.
It is hard-core old school.
They don't even have a website.
Socioeconomic breakdown's all over the map.
Yeah, so are the ages.
Students are 12 to 18 years old,
On the same campus, in the same dorms.
Same personnel has worked there for a lifetime.
Ron Massey has been superintendent for 30 years.
He's an alum, as the majority of the staff there.
Lieutenant Tawes has been his second in command
This whole time.
These type of places have their own infrastructure.
If it ain't broken, they ain't gonna fix it.
That's probably why they banned modern technology.
They didn't need it back then, they don't need it now.
Aggressive motto--
"Vivere est vincere."
To live is to conquer.
The school raises soldiers.
Suicide is not part of that mantra.
Bailey Shelton was only 13 years old.
He was one of the youngest students there.
His death is probably the key to the others.
Colonel Massey,
Erin Strauss.
This is the team I spoke with you about.
Agent Hotchner.
This is agent Morgan, agent Jareau,
Dr. Spencer Reid, and Penelope Garcia.
So shouldn't the flag be at half-mast?
I haven't told the boys yet.
Do they know who we are?
I'll tell them when the time is right.
I've called all of the parents.
They're driving from up and down the east coast.
In fact, Josh Redding's have just arrived.
I'd like to speak with them.
They're in the chapel.
How are they?
As you'd expect.
All right, I'll get started.
Cadet.
Any leads on Josh?
In that terrain,
He's only capable of moving a mile an hour.
Puts him in a 60-mile radius.
That's 3,600 square miles to cover.
Tawes knows those woods better than anybody.
We've got two agents meeting him
and we'll start the investigation here.
Where's the place with the most outlets?
Best bet is in the library.
Thank you.
We'd like to start with Bailey Shelton's suicide.
Do you have a copy of the medical examiner's report?
I don't.
But there was no question he hung himself.
Well, the nuances can tell us a lot.
The doctor's receiving the last of the bodies now.
I expect he's got his hands full.
I'll speak to him later.
Of course.
It would be helpful to us
To know what Bailey's last day was like.
I'll show you.
He stayed in the plebes hall.
His father took all of his belongings After the suicide.
Josh's items are as they were.
Josh stayed with the first years?
He's the brigade commander.
Bailey's suicide hit him hard.
Were all the victims friends of Bailey's?
Brotherhood is the very price and condition
Of man's survival.
Carlos Romulo.
All of my boys are brothers.
There's Tucker Calhoun's parents.
Excuse me.
If the boys were so vulnerable,
why did they send them into the woods?
Because it was time for their survival test.
We have a docket.
It's been only two weeks since the initial suicide.
You couldn't postpone this trip?
Classes were canceled The day after Bailey died.
But men are lost in battle all the time.
This isn't battle, and these aren't men.
They are when they leave here.
How many suicides have you seen?
Just these.
So part of the mission was unsupervised?
For a week.
But you came back 6 days later.
Standard procedure to check in if the weather's extreme.
Had lightning and thunder last night.
The boys didn't have any way to communicate with you?
Smoke signal.
Seriously?
Basic survival skills, ma'am.
We teach them to follow their instincts, not rely on technology.
No radio, no weapons.
Well, survival courses like these
Often trigger a fight or flight response.
It looks like that's what happened to Josh.
Who slept here?
Don't know. They're all identical.
Whoever was here took off.
And it's secluded.
Did Josh Redding isolate himself a lot?
I suppose.
He was a loner.
And why is that?
He didn't want to be at Somerville in the first place.
Why did you send Josh here?
Because he was getting into a lot of trouble.
And he was always angry and...
He was being a teenager.
You were gone, Will.
All the time.
He was nearly 6 feet tall By the time he was 14.
With a bad temper,
And he was punching holes in walls,
And he wouldn't listen to me anymore.
He could be belligerent.
But this--
This was extreme.
Why?
We had to force him.
What are you doing? Let me go!
We're helping you, Josh.
Mom, dad, please, don't let them do this!
They're not gonna hurt you.
Dad, please!
I was afraid he was gonna hurt himself.
Or someone else if we didn't get him some help.
How was Josh taking Bailey's suicide?
We only talked once after that.
Phone calls are a privilege here.
Was that difficult for Josh?
Josh has never been much of a talker,
But I think he felt a real responsibility for Bailey
And the other boys in the hall.
Did he ever tell you Why
Bailey may have killed himself?
No.
Mr. Redding.
How are you gonna get my boy back here?
These beds are all 3 feet apart
And there's absolutely no privacy.
How did Bailey hang himself without anybody noticing?
Apparently he did it in here.
He used Josh's room?
According to Massey,
Josh offered Bailey a lot of support.
He told you that?
Yes, when we spoke.
Is that a problem?
Is there anything else he mentioned?
The boys come in here just to sleep. It's why it's so minimal.
Strauss, what, are you on the board or something?
I just saw the campus same as you.
It's hardly prison.
These kids are told what to wear, what to say, and when to eat.
This goes against the very nature of these boys.
They're all looking for some type of control in their lives,
And this place strips them of that.
And suicide is the ultimate power?
Isn't it?
Well, at least the boys felt enough remorse to write "We're sorry."
That doesn't trump taking your own life.
What is it?
But I guess I can buy that the other kids
Couldn't hear Bailey hang himself.
Josh was laying right here.
I've never seen a mass suicide apology.
Maybe they knew it would help their parents.
Could be confessing other sins.
Who was in this tree?
Tucker Calhoun.
Good cadet.
Looks like Josh has doubled back a few times.
But the dogs can't find him.
Is he familiar with these woods?
All first years come here for a mission.
Josh tried to run away back then but didn't get far.
None of them do.
But after 3 more years of training...
He didn't weigh himself down with supplies.
Smart.
We taught him well.
Colonel, it's been 6 days since the suicides.
Why hasn't Josh come back to campus?
He's got trust issues.
I thought he was doing well.
Too smart for his own good.
The most dangerous kind.
Dangerous to whom?
Himself. Boys like Josh reject the lessons of men.
His generation has little respect for their elders.
Does that include you?
We've been working on it.
All the first years start in the laundry room.
It teaches them responsibility.
Ten-hut!
Bailey finished his rotation
And walked back to his bunk.
So he was still here for bed check?
It wasn't the first time.
Was he punished for being late?
If you're suggesting that Bailey killed himself
Because of a talking to, that's absurd.
That could depend on what you said.
He understood I was disappointed.
Were the victims' bunks made before they went into the woods?
Each and every morning.
So where did they get the sheets to hang themselves?
Carry on.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Jeez, you scared me.
I thought you were a ghost.
You know, older buildings like this
Emit a low enough frequency that you can't consciously hear.
Because the sensory overload can't be explained,
It wreaks havoc with your emotions,
Inducing fear, panic, and dread,
Hence the feeling of being haunted.
What about the visions?
Your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing.
That said, I do know a 3-year-old boy
That once met a friendly apparition named leverett saltonstall.
He was nice?
Very nice.
You'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms.
It's not in the basement?
It's on the opposite side of campus.
That's so strange.
Yeah.
Leaves of 3, let them be.
Oh, man. Poison ivy. Alcohol swabs, stat.
Thank you. You know, if I've got it, so do you.
I'm Italian. It knows better. Where's Massey?
He's meeting with the victims' families. They're arriving now.
JJ, how are Josh's parents?
Upset. They sent him here to keep him away from trouble.
Tawes made it seem like these guys are the only family they have.
You make it sound like a cult.
Uh, it kind of is.
This is a well-respected institution.
They're not on trial.
The integral part of the investigation
Is going to be understanding what these victims lived every day.
And with who.
Bailey Shelton Killed himself in Josh Redding's room.
Was Josh in the room that night?
According to the records.
I will dig for dirt.
Dave, you find anything in the woods?
Josh's tent was secluded.
His things were left behind. He just took off.
Massey said he never got any respect from Josh.
And Josh's own parents said he was impossible to control.
His course load indicates increased isolation.
Isolated, smart, angry.
That could be a budding psychopath.
What are you saying?
Josh Redding killed his classmates?
Then he's not missing. He's on the run.
And he was been for a week.
One hell of a head start.
With all the skills he could ever need.
Stand...a-ten-hut!
Persent...arms!
Order...arms!
Colonel, any sign of Josh?
Tawes was out there all night.
The volunteers have spread out to the next county.
Where do you think he'd go?
To higher ground. But we would have seen him by now.
Sir, you said it was Josh
who found Bailey hanging in his room, correct?
When he woke up, yes.
You didn't find it to be odd that Josh could sleep through that?
What are you saying?
Josh is the only person in common with all these deaths.
You think Josh killed Bailey?
It's a possibility.
I sent a murderer into the woods.
Whoever did this wanted us to find them just like Bailey Shelton.
Ok, so how did he do it?
How did Josh control 5 strong kids?
Josh supervised the cadets both in the bunk and the laundry room.
That could explain how the sheets got out.
Yeah, so what does "We're sorry" mean
If it wasn't written for suicide?
What if Josh wanted them to apologize for something?
For their sins?
There's no record Of bad behavior,
but all of these guys were alpha males.
The were all upperclassmen who might have bullied Bailey.
The message was carved under Tucker Calhoun's tree for a reason.
Yeah. We need to know more about that kid.
What are you looking at?
THE M.E.'s report.
Bilateral fracture Of the pars interarticular of the c2 vertebra.
What's that?
Classic hangman's fracture,
But only one of the 5 victims had it.
Which one?
Tucker Calhoun.
Jeez, who is this guy?
The others suffered rotational fractures, hanging was secondary.
Staging the crime scene.
Josh is more sophisticated than we thought.
And vindictive.
He wanted Tucker to suffer.
The question is why.
Tawes thinks he's on a rescue mission.
He still is.
We've got an enemy out there.
Someone who killed 6 of my boys.
We need to figure out why.
We need to start with everyone who knows Josh.
...march!
No, ma'am, Josh didn't have friends.
Why is that?
It depends on who you ask, sir.
What was his relationship with Tucker Calhoun?
Josh is straight up. This place never broke him.
No matter how hard they tried.
Who tried to break him? Tucker?
A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal,
Or tolerate those who do.
You've got an honor code.
My guess is not everyone lives by it.
You do.
Ma'am. Sir.
Right face!
Forward march!
They all gonna be like that?
Not all of them.
"We shall defend our island,
"Whatever the cost may be,
"We shall fight on the beaches,
"We shall fight on the landing grounds,
"We shall fight in the fields and in the streets,
"We shall fight in the hills,
"We shall never surrender.
"We shall defend our island,
Whatever the cost may be."
Why the hell would Josh hurt them?
Has Josh been more distant this year?
Well, his course load is extreme.
Did he specifically complain about anyone to you?
I already told you no.
You said he was frustrated being saddled with the younger cadets?
That boy Bailey cried himself to sleep every damn night.
Maybe Josh had had enough of that.
He met him outside.
Bailey's father couldn't come into this building.
So Josh folded is clothes, his towels, everything,
All so that his dad wouldn't have to walk past this room.
That's who my son is.
That's who my son is.
Is it true Josh killed them all?
Do you think he did?
I wouldn't fool with Josh.
You're a smart kid.
He's a big guy.
You ever see him fight?
All the time.
What about Josh and Tucker Calhoun?
Did they ever get into it?
Tucker was an ass.
He used to come in here
and pee on the sheets after we washed them.
Did he do that on the night
That Bailey Shelton committed suicide?
The bastard did it every night.
Do you think Josh wanted to punish those kids
for picking on Bailey?
Sure. But he wasn't supposed to be on that trip, anyway.
What do you mean?
It's a leadership reward.
You gotta have at least 20 points to go.
But Josh only had 16.
Points?
They're posted.
More points, more rewards.
How many do you have?
Negative 5.
Good luck.
Thanks for the help.
No one told us about a point system.
So Tucker Calhoun has the most points.
Who approves them?
Massey.
Well, maybe Tucker was his little pet.
Leader of everything.
That comes with an attitude.
Steamroller types like that,
don't let anybody get in their way.
Nothing was nice about that kid.
It sounds like he strong-armed everybody.
Well, then the points are for bad behavior,
Only they're not calling it that.
We should look at the points
Of everyone who died in those woods.
My guess is they were all bullies.
Except for Josh.
Hotch, is something going on with Strauss?
Why?
Well, she's awfully protective of this place.
She's got pressure from above.
You sure it's nothing else?
She doesn't like the field.
Really.
Any word from josh?
No.
Colonel,
We need to speak to Bailey Shelton's parents.
Well, his mother died years ago.
I could get hold of his father.
Do that, please.
What's going on?
Josh had contact with Bailey's father the day he died.
And you think he could give you
behavioral clues about Josh?
It's all we have right now, Strauss.
The man just lost his son.
Do you really think he's going to remember how Josh acted?
By all means, I'm open to other suggestions.
Massey knows his students better than anyone.
Why not trust him?
Because all Massey wants right now is for this to go away.
He'll tell us whatever he thinks we want to hear.
Oh, hell.
What the hell was he doing way out here?
It isn't exactly the kind of place he'd stumble upon.
Do you think josh built this trap?
Right out of the Somerville handbook.
He even used his poncho to cover it.
He lured Chris Shelton here.
The body was still warm. Probably died just a few hours ago.
So Josh couldn't be far away.
Tawes already took off. Thinks he can find him.
A little help?
So why would Josh want Bailey's father dead?
The duffel's from Somerville.
It's got Bailey's stuff in it--
And these.
Bed sheets.
He's the one who hung those boys.
Ok, so he blamed them
For bullying his son,
And Josh escaped.
Josh wasn't supposed to be out here in the first place.
This trap was to protect himself.
But this place isn't on any map.
How did Bailey's dad find it?
Somebody tipped him off.
I make a promise to watch after these boys.
In many ways they're my own.
Then something like this happens.
Colonel, so you're saying Josh was in his room
The night that Bailey hung himself?
What is it with you people?
I've already told agent morgan.
Was Josh in his room?
Yes.
23 cadets sleep in that building.
They're saying he wasn't there.
They're lying.
But that's against your code.
They haven't been here long
enough to understand the importance of it.
Did Josh find Bailey in the laundry room after that check?
Bailey was his responsibility.
And who else was there?
No one.
Are we finished?
Tucker Calhoun liked to pick on Bailey.
Was he there?
No.
Josh didn't have enough points to go on the trip.
Why did you send him?
He needed the challenge.
Tell me this--
Did Josh kill Chris Shelton in the woods?
He was being chased,
In which case it was self-defense.
Josh killed a man.
Any advice on how to tell his parents?
Prentiss said mr. Shelton had a cell phone.
I'm gonna need to see that.
Doesn't the school have a cell phone?
Mm-mmm. Goes against their policy, remember?
So is playing favorites. You know, a man like Massey
Sets rules but is the first to break them.
He's been left alone to run
these kids' lives and nobody questions him.
Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that.
His policies are a combination of many other philosophies.
I'm not sure where his actual leadership lies.
Only that it does...lie, that is.
It's a joke.
Good joke.
Oh, my gosh.
The school does have a cell phone.
Only it's not listed under massey.
The account was opened... by Tawes.
If Massey's lying about something as simple as a cell phone,
What else is he hiding?
I met Chris Shelton when he claimed his son's body.
This is the last thing I expected.
Multiple points of entry from the spears.
He still wears his wedding ring.
Bailey was all he had left.
He'd do anything to protect him.
I'm not sure about that.
Bailey's trachea showed signs of scarring.
He'd attempted suicide before?
No. It was internal damage.
He had stress to his heart and lungs
That isn't typical in someone his age.
It's not in your report.
It wasn't related to the C.O.D.
How old are the injuries?
It's hard to say.
Then you assume his father was abusive?
Someone was.
I didn't think much of it
Till I saw similar scars on the other boys.
Including blisters and burns on their hands,
On all of them?
Their scars were much older, but yes. Identical.
Sir, may I?
When did you decide where the boys would be camping?
The day Tawes dropped them off.
No one else knew?
No need.
You didn't write it down anywhere?
We don't use maps of that terrain.
You're expected to know it.
Mr. Shelton must have been quite upset when you saw him.
Of course he was.
Who did he blame?
What?
For his son's suicide. Who did he blame?
I have no idea.
Well, the guilt must have manifested itself elsewhere.
Was it you?
Excuse me?
He was a desperate widower
Who put his son in your hands. He trusted you,
And look what happened.
Ma'am...
What?
We're trying to help him and he's keeping things from us.
I have cooperated fully.
Did you blame someone?
Josh redding? Tucker Calhoun?
This is ridiculous.
Oh, for god sakes, colonel!
He didn't just find that campsite all by himself.
It's time you leave.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the patience for this.
He's clearly hiding something.
All due respect, ma'am,
Have you been drinking?
What?
What are you talking about?
Strauss, we have one shot at this.
You think I don't know that?
Well, if he smelled what I can smell
On your breath right now, the credibility
Of this investigation would be compromised.
The organ damage is severe,
Like the boys have been suffocated,
But what about the blisters
The youngest cadets probably have the freshest scars.
All right, well, we're gonna need one of them to admit it.
Hotch, she's drinking.
Strauss?
Yeah. She needs help, man.
She could blow this case.
What happened?
She laid into Massey.
She actually said the kind of things I would have said.
And for a minute I was like, ok, good.
She's finally on our side.
But then I smelled it, Hotch.
I asked you if something was going on.
You partnered me with her.
Morgan, she was getting help.
I'm gonna have to call E.A.P.
But this is not--
What? This is not about me?
Is that what you were gonna say?
You know how many times I've heard that, Hotch?
Well, I am tired of it.
You keep telling me that I have problems trusting people.
Well, from where I'm standing,
You're the one who can't trust anyone with anything.
Any sign of Josh?
Tawes is still looking.
I need to find students who are having trouble with authority.
Ok, I can do that.
But I gotta tell you, they post rewards
Faster than they do demerits.
All right, well, look for kids who had disciplinary issues
Before they came here.
Ok. I got a few.
All right, did any of them have class with Bailey Shelton?
No, but each of the plebes have laundry duty. Does that help?
Their dorm is the farthest point from the laundry room.
Why are they so isolated?
The M.E. Said Bailey had blisters and burns,
Fingertips were raw, his trachea had internal scarring.
That's awful.
Guys, that could be damage done
Inside an industrial-size dryer.
Oh, my god.
That's how Massey's breaking these boys.
Hey, Bailey.
Tucker. Tucker, don't, please.
Please, Tucker. Please.
Please, tucker. Please!
Please! Stop it!
Please stop it! I can't breathe!
Let him out!
Go, Bailey, run!
No. In all the materials it
says they don't believe in corporal punishment.
Bailey writes about each of those boys and how they bullied him.
His father must have read it and wants revenge.
Does it mention Josh?
Not at all.
Then why would Chris Shelton go after him?
What if massey lied to Chris Shelton?
And set Josh up.
And he convinced Shelton
that josh was responsible for Bailey's suicide.
That still doesn't explain how he found the secluded woods.
Wait, where's mr. Shelton's phone?
It's right here.
It's got a couple of contacts on it,
Somerville academy being one of them.
Any unknowns? Tawes has a cell.
No way. Lieutenant no tech?
There's one unknown. It's a text.
It looks like, uh, phone numbers.
What are they?
252-5727...
And 802-8448.
Those aren't phone numbers. That's latitude and longitude.
Right where those boys were camping.
Massey's withheld information at every step along the way.
He's not to be trusted.
What's your theory?
He's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment
In which children like Bailey Shelton and others
Are repeatedly abused.
Josh is a protector type.
His power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.
We believe that's when everything shifted.
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.
There's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.
Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods,
But Massey sent him anyway.
Why would Massey give josh the opportunity to escape?
He wouldn't. He had another agenda.
Massey texted Chris Shelton the coordinates for the campsite,
Not to hurt all the boys, but to take out Josh.
But he didn't count on josh fighting back.
And he underestimated the power of Chris Shelton's revenge.
Staging the murders to look
exactly like Bailey's death was a message.
To who?
To Massey.
Chris Shelton wanted Massey to lose his sons, too.
Josh knows Massey has secrets,
And he's the only person who can bring the school down.
And now Massey will do anything to destroy Josh.
Sir.
Have you found him yet?
Negative, sir.
You finish this. Understand?
Yes, sir.
We need to find Josh before tawes does.
Tawes has a massive head start.
Josh is close and has a plan. How would he escape?
Get to higher ground.
What's the fastest way out?
He'd look for wheels. How did Chris Shelton get there?
He probably drove his own car. We didn't see any ATVs.
Chris Shelton drives a truck.
Did you see one on the road on the way in?
No.
Where's the next closest road?
Well, it's a trek. It's at least a few miles north
Of where the body was just found.
That leaves 3 likely areas where he would have parked.
Mm-mmm. You didn't find any keys, did you?
Because Josh probably took them.
All right, we need to divide up.
Come on.
I've waited 3 years for this.
You little bitch.
Tawes, don't do it. Uhh!
It's over.
Yes, mrs. Jarvis.
I understand your concerns,
But we're all fine.
Soldiers, ma'am.
Call anytime.
Colonel Ron Massey,
You're under arrest.
I've done nothing.
You texted Chris Shelton the coordinates of the campsite.
That makes you an accessory to murder.
Texted?
Ok, fine.
You had tawes do it.
Why would I do that?
Because you had no power or control over Josh,
And you couldn't handle that.
The problem is, he wasn't gonna go away quietly.
He wanted you to pay for all those years of abuse.
No one will believe Josh.
He's a troubled boy.
He's a grown man, colonel.
You should be proud.
"Beware, so long as you live,
Of judging men by their outward appearance."
Jean de la Fontaine.
You got a minute?
Yeah.
Do you have the after-action report?
No.
I need it on my desk by the morning.
I'll give it to the director.
Pardon?
It's time for you to admit that you need some help.
I don't take orders from you, Aaron.
You put my team in jeopardy.
Is that what you told him, agent Morgan?
You compromised the integrity of the unit.
I did no such thing.
Open the drawer, ma'am.
This is absurd.
Aaron.
Aaron, what are you doing?
One call to the E.A.P. And everything will be all right.
In what world will this be all right?
You have no idea what this is going to do to me.
Agent Morgan will make sure that you get checked in privately.
And for that you should be grateful.
