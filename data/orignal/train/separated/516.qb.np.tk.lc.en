thank you .
yeah , sorry .
well , tell your friends .

me ? no . i don &apos;t even have a boyfriend .
that can &apos;t be true .
hey , we &apos;re going to a bar tonight called the wolf and the rose .
do you know it ?
we heard it &apos;s haunted .
so they say .
let me guess . that &apos;s where
your bachelorette party &apos;s going to be ?
you should come by for a drink .
i don &apos;t know , you girls get pretty wild at those things .
that &apos;s it . ok , kids .

i might be worried .
yeah .
ah , look at him . he &apos;s still got it .
all right , baby .
hey , what up , mama ?
wild guess ... we got a case ?
you are correct .
please pass go and collect 200 kisses from moi ,
and hotch wants to see us .
for what ?
he didn &apos;t say , but i &apos;m having flashbacks to being in high school
and having to go to the principal &apos;s office .
you are too cute . just breathe , mama .
ok .
i &apos;m coming in now .
i got a call from the warden at adx florence in colorado .
giuseppe montolo has refused our latest request to talk to him .
he told the warden to tell us he &apos;s too busy .
he &apos;s a hitman in prison . how busy can he be ?
he &apos;s playing us .
the only leverage he has is
a list of 12 potential victims targeted by a network of hitmen .
as long as he keeps this list of the dirty dozen close to the vest ,
he keeps us on the hook .
well , that may be . we still have to treat this as a dead end .
have you found anything to help us identify
who the potential targets are ?
sir , i &apos;ve been working all my channels 24 / 7,
shaking every digital tree . nothing yet .
i know . keep digging .
we can &apos;t protect them until we know who they are .
what ?
what &apos;s going on in that beautiful mind of yours ?
i have been up every night
thinking about how somewhere out there
there are the lives of 12 strangers
in my freakishly beautiful doll @-@ like hands ,
and what if i don &apos;t get there in time
and they &apos;re already dead or mostly--
stop . stop , stop .
look at me . you &apos;re gonna find them .
right . of course i will .
and when we get a break in the case ,
we &apos;re gonna put away all of the bad guys
just like we always do .
because you said so .
let &apos;s get started .
ok . savannah , georgia ,
known for its charm and southern hospitality ,
though not so much for
brandy green of dover , delaware ,
because 3 months ago , she came to town for a bachelor party ,
and after a night of bar hopping with her bridesmaids ,
ended up in a dumpster in a back alley .
cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head .
what &apos;s that wrapped around her face ?
that would be sash she was wearing all night
that says &quot; bride @-@ to @-@ be &quot; embroidered on it .
the wrapping could be ritualistic , like a shroud of some sort .
or a sign of the killer &apos;s remorse .
but this happened 3 months ago .
why are we getting this now ?
because two days ago ,
the body of ashley wilcox of dayton , ohio ,
was also found in an alley dumpster in savannah .
and she also had blunt force trauma ,
but she was strangled to death with her bride @-@ to @-@ be sash .
it &apos;s unlikely the work of the same jilted lover ,
since the two women lived
in different states hundreds of miles apart .
they could be surrogates . any sign of sexual assault ?
none on brandy . we don &apos;t know about ashley yet .
what &apos;s interesting is the unsub doesn &apos;t care
about hiding the bodies very well .
well , he &apos;d have to be physically fit
to lift the bodies into the dumpsters .
he could be sending a message
that to him women are trash , disposable .
no , this is about marriage .
he &apos;s taking these brides on the eve of what should be
the happiest day of their lives .
he wants to crush that .
their weddings have become their wakes .
let me hear you ! come on !
shot ! shot ! shot ! shot ! shot ! shot ! shot ...
i &apos;m getting married , bitches !
i need some air . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey !
open up !
anybody ? !
damn .
hey !
i &apos;m walking here .
i &apos;m so sorry .
trees are lazy .
cold is monkey ears and toes .
bitcoin .
&quot; and think not that you can direct
&quot; the course of love .
&quot; for love that finds you worthy
directs your course . &quot;
kahlil gibran &apos;s &quot; the prophet . &quot;
established in 1733 , savannah is the oldest city in georgia
and one of the south &apos;s most popular wedding destinations .
brandy and ashley are both low @-@ risk lifestyle victims ,
but their behavior the nights they were murdered
was anything but .
bar hopping , being intoxicated in public ,
getting separated from their friends ,
all of that would have raised their risk levels ,
making them easy prey .
but i am not victim blaming here .
it &apos;s entirely understandable that both women
would have wanted to enjoy themselves
during their last nights as single women .
and from the unsub &apos;s point of view ,
the bars are target rich environments .
but why pick only brides @-@ to @-@ be ?
why not choose women a little less high @-@ profile ?
wearing a bride @-@ to @-@ be sash
must be like waving a red cape at a bull .
actually , bulls are colorblind .
so it doesn &apos;t really matter what color cape a matador waves ,
it &apos;s the cape &apos;s movement
that elicits an aggressive charge response .
but morgan &apos;s metaphor still applies here .
this is probably a man who had his own engagement broken off ,
so living in savannah , surrounded by weddings and happy brides ,
it must be driving him crazy .
sir , we just got a report
that a third bride @-@ to @-@ be went missing .
madison mills , 25,
from tampa , florida ,
was celebrating at a bar with her bridesmaids last night ,
when she disappeared .
she &apos;s supposed to get married next sunday .
the first victim was 3 months ago ,
the second two days ago , and now madison .
he &apos;s accelerating .
he may be a townie trolling bars to meet women .
what if he interacted with them
and they turned down his advances ?
he could have felt emasculated , thus triggering his rage .
i &apos;ll see if there &apos;s any connection between the brides @-@ to @-@ be .
and , garcia ,
look for men living in the area with violent criminal records .
also any men who were recently engaged
and any who &apos;ve had the engagements broken off .
check for cold feet . got it .
so how do we know madison didn &apos;t hook up with a guy at a bar ?
i mean , she could still be sleeping it off
and just doesn &apos;t want to face her friends .
we should check into that .
in the meantime , morgan ,
you and lewis retrace the victim &apos;s last steps .
reid , go to the m.e. ,
and dave and i will go to the p.d. and talk to the families .
captain , i &apos;m agent hotchner , this is agent rossi .
glad you &apos;re here .
i started coordination with local media like you asked .
great . madison &apos;s parents , are they here yet ?
their plane just landed .
i sent a cruiser over to pick them up from the airport .
what about the bridal party ?
they were the last ones to see her .
yeah . the maid of honor , kelly goodwin ,
she &apos;s on her way in .
the other bridesmaids are back at the hotel if you need them .
this way .
ashley wilcox , cause of death ,
asphyxiation caused by strangulation .
her head was wrapped postmortem .
were you able to get anything out of the sash ?
some trace dna .
we &apos;re running it through codis .
the ligature marks show hesitation
on the part of the killer .
he pulled the sash tight across her neck
and then released it several times before she died .
it could be the unsub &apos;s way of torturing his victims ,
or he &apos;s reluctant to kill .
this looks like it was caused by some sort of heavy object .
i &apos;m thinking a flashlight or a lead pipe , perhaps .
that &apos;s what i was thinking .
any sign of sexual assault ?
no . the first victim , brandy green ,
died instantly from the blow to her head ,
but the killer took more time with ashley .
the unsub could be impotent ,
and choking his victims
is how he satiates his urges .
the press @-@ on nails on that hand are missing ,
probably ripped off in the struggle .
the nails have been bitten off .
maybe ashley bit her nails before she was tortured ?
nail @-@ biting &apos;s an unsanitary habit , but pretty common .
true , but it &apos;s still considered an impulse control disorder .
it &apos;s often associated with other body focus repetitive behaviors
such as skin picking , skin biting , and trichotillomania .
but , in this case , i think there &apos;s more to it than that ,
because the nails haven &apos;t been bitten underneath the press @-@ on nails .
are you testing the saliva ?
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking the unsub bit ashley &apos;s nails .
i &apos;ve seen some freaky stuff in my day ,
but never this .
he most likely has some sort of mental disorder .
i &apos;ll say .
when madison didn &apos;t come back ,
i went outside to see if she was sick .
we were drinking a lot .
but you couldn &apos;t find her . did you try her cell ?
she didn &apos;t answer . it went right to voicemail .
we thought maybe she went back to the hotel .
but this morning when she still didn &apos;t come back ...
that was when you called the police ?
and this all happened at the wolf and the rose ?
yes .
ok , kelly , would you be willing to try something
that could help us find out what else you might remember ?
anything , if it will help find maddie .
i want you to close your eyes .
ok , good .
now think back to last night .
think about the sounds ,
smells , the textures you experienced .
what &apos;s the first thing you noticed when you walked in the door ?
the smell of stale beer .
and it was noisy .
i had to shout to be heard over the talking and music .
i kept getting bumped because it was so crowded .
but i didn &apos;t care .
we were all having fun , especially maddie .
i &apos;m getting married , bitches !
people were buying us drinks .
they were happy for her .
so was i.
was there anybody trying to get close ,
anybody making you feel uncomfortable ?
no . no one .
wait .
there was someone .
i know who you girls are .
i had just asked the dj to play a song .
i was walking back to maddie .
this guy was yelling at her .
what was he saying ?
don &apos;t lie !
i couldn &apos;t really hear . it didn &apos;t make sense .
what did he look like ?
um , white ,
light hair .
i &apos;m not real sure .
did madison know him ?
when i asked , she said he was just some drunk .
do you think he took maddie ?
we don &apos;t know . but we &apos;re gonna get you and your friends
to look at some mug shots , ok ?
can i go back to the hotel now ?
i think i &apos;d like to lay down .
yeah , sure .
thank you , kelly . you did really great .
so maybe our unsub likes a challenge ?
he wants a woman who &apos;s the center of everyone &apos;s attention ?
well , we know how he got madison ,
but how did he get brandy and ashley ?
hey , talk to me , sweet stuff .
so diving into local arrest records ,
one name keeps popping up .
karl ulrich .
he lays asphalt for a living ,
and here &apos;s where the plot thickens
like a viscous , creepy soup .
3 months ago his fiancee left him at the altar
and he have gone off a deep end ever since .
sit down , karl .
well , you &apos;ve got quite the reputation here .
public intoxication ,
trespassing , harassing women .
you &apos;ve been kicked out of most every bar in town ,
the latest being the wolf and the rose last night .
i wasn &apos;t bothering nobody .
i was just being friendly .
with a young woman named madison mills .
she &apos;s getting married next week .
that &apos;s my problem how ?
she went missing last night .
well , hey , i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about that .
maybe the bitch changed her mind about the guy and took off .
like your former fiancee stacy ?
she left you 3 months before your wedding .
wow . that must have really pissed you off .
nah . it &apos;s all good .
really ?
because you violated a restraining order
she took out against you .
i went over there to get my ring back .
where did you go last night after the wolf and the rose ?
went out with some buddies .
where ?
to an all @-@ night diner on bay street .
check it out if you don &apos;t believe me .
oh , we will .
i &apos;d say take a picture , it lasts longer ,
but i &apos;m the photographer .
hey , that &apos;s really beautiful .
you &apos;re a real artist .
really ?
yeah .
come on , smile .
oh , no , ryan , not me .
say limburger .
no , stop .
stop !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
oh , your sister and i are having a little fun .
great news . the georgia woman &apos;s association
accepted our bid to do the flowers for its fundraising gala .
that is great .
awesome , nicole .
it &apos;s gonna be a lot of work ,
but it &apos;ll really raise our profile .
and , ryan , they loved your work
and they want you to do the photography .
terrific .
of course they did .
how could anyone resist you ?
you &apos;re gonna give me a big head .
i &apos;ve been on the phone all day .
how about we go grab some coffee at jumping java ?
dana , you want some ?
um ... uh , no , i &apos;m good .
we &apos;ll only be about an hour .
you know there &apos;s nothing going on between me and your sister .
it &apos;s all an act so i can be closer to you .
really ? you promise ?
have i ever lied to you ?
you know who the real threat to our love is ...
and what you have to do .
all night , huh ?
all right , mama . thanks .
captain , you can release karl ulrich .
i thought he looked good for it .
when i showed him madison &apos;s photo ,
he had absolutely no cognitive reaction to her .
and his alibi checks out .
karl &apos;s a creepy dude and he definitely has issues with women ,
but he &apos;s not our unsub .
so we &apos;re back to no suspects .
madison &apos;s been gone 15 hours now ,
longer than any of the other women .
we still have no idea how madison and the unsub
crossed paths before the wolf and the rose .
if we can figure out where he first saw her ,
we may still save her .
i don &apos;t think i can do it .
you did it before .
i know , but i--
you saw how she was flirting with me ,
touching my arm , begging me to come for a drink .
well , maybe she was just being nice .
no , she &apos;s a slut .
she wants me in her bed .
i thought you loved me , dana .
of course i do .
see ?
this is you and me at our 7th grade dance .
that &apos;s when i knew i loved you .
then you must protect the purity of our love .
do what has to be done .
i &apos;m sorry .
you only have yourself to blame .
baby girl , you there ?
speak now or forever hold your peace .
listen , reid thinks that our unsub may have a mental illness .
run that against your list of local men with records .
domestic disputes ,
peeping , public intoxication .
and check to see if any have been released
from public or private mental health institutions within the area .
bingo , 5 names . sending them now .
a man walking his dog found her .
why change dump sites now ?
the unsub could have figured a dumpster downtown was too risky .
she &apos;s got a gash on the side of her head like the others .
and look at this .
is that lipstick ?
by wrapping and marking madison &apos;s face ,
the unsub &apos;s taking away her beauty .
and by choosing the word &quot; slut , &quot;
the unsub &apos;s commenting on madison &apos;s virtue .
virtue and beauty are
traditionally celebrated attributes in women .
that &apos;s especially true for a bride or a bride @-@ to @-@ be .
the unsub is female .
how do you figure that ?
3 female victims , no sign of sexual assault ,
and the victims were all strangled , but not manually .
and the word &quot; slut &quot; written here in lipstick ,
is linguistically a word choice typically made by females .
now it &apos;s time to deliver the profile .
we believe the unknown subject we &apos;re looking for
is a white woman in her late 20s to early 30s .
because she was able to subdue , control , transport , and dispose
of the 3 victims , she &apos;s most likely large and strong .
but she comes across as non @-@ threatening ,
allowing her to get close to her victims before attacking them .
we should be interviewing wedding vendors .
they may have come in contact with this woman .
this list obviously includes caterers , florists ,
photographers , wedding planners ,
hotel managers , and bridal shop workers .
and even though brides @-@ to @-@ be seems to be the only target right now .
it &apos;s important that everyone take precautions .
we need you to pay attention .
be aware of your surroundings
and do not go out alone .
if you &apos;re in a group , stay in a group .
and if you happen to be drinking , then be smart about it
and let somebody else drive for you .
is she making a statement about the institution of marriage ?
because of her poor self @-@ image ,
as evidenced by the demeaning language and the nail @-@ biting ,
we believe she is angry with these brides @-@ to @-@ be
because of some romantic frustration or disappointment
in her own life .
she &apos;s most likely lashing out over something or someone
she feels she &apos;ll never have .
she attacks with a level of violence
that demonstrates this is personal .
she may be jealous of her victims
for having something that she desperately wants herself .
thank you .
i love to watch you sleep .
ohh . i must have fallen asleep waiting for you .
i &apos;m here now .
i did what you asked .
that girl won &apos;t bother you anymore .
bother us .
you did the right thing .
really ?
absolutely .
dana , you in here ?
dana , are you ok ?
there , that &apos;s better .
it &apos;s a gorgeous day .
could go for a walk around the lake .
remember when we were little ,
we &apos;d stay out all day till it was dark .
mama &apos;d stand on the lawn calling our names .
the only way she could get us to come home
was by bribing us with ice cream .
what do you say about going back to see dr. gorman ?
i don &apos;t need to .
i could come with .
i &apos;m fine .
dana , you &apos;re sleeping a lot .
and locking yourself away in your basement workshop ,
it &apos;s not good .
and all this online shopping , sweetie , i &apos;m worried .
you taking your medication ?
i told you already , i don &apos;t need to .
i &apos;m fine .
ok .
sorry .
hey . ryan wants to take you and me out tonight
to lombardi &apos;s for a special dinner .
he does ?
uh @-@ huh .
he said special ?
why don &apos;t you take a shower and put on something nice ?
ok .
great .
what can you tell us , garcia ?
that the stress and pressure of planning the perfect wedding
is enough to drive anyone bonkers .
garcia , you find any connection
between the wedding vendors and the 3 victims ?
oh , yeah . brandy , ashley , and madison
all went to the same 30 vendors ,
one of which does a horse @-@ drawn pumpkin carriage .
i mean , come on . i need that in my life .
anyway , i talked to all the vendors
and none of them remember a large , strong non @-@ threatening woman
who was recently dumped by her fiance
so she had to cancel all of her plans .
they said they &apos;d definitely remember a customer like that .
but what if the unsub didn &apos;t visit one of the vendors ?
what if she is one of the vendors ?
that &apos;s a more statistically probable way
that the unsub could come in contact with all the victims .
if she had a relationship that ended badly ,
dealing with happy brides every day could fuel her anger .
garcia , see if any of the vendors fit the profile
and if any have been recently divorced .
asketh and you shall receiveth .
if she &apos;s attacking brides @-@ to @-@ be
because she was in a bad relationship
or one didn &apos;t go as she hoped ,
then she &apos;s most likely depressed .
yeah , but in my experience , depressed women
don &apos;t display this level of violence towards others .
even if the depression &apos;s so severe , it leads to psychosis ?
the red one .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this . this sneaking around ,
hiding our love .
we should be together .
you &apos;re right .
no more hiding .
tonight at dinner , you and i
are gonna tell your sister and the world about us .
you promise ?
i promise .
is it fresh ?
it &apos;s hot .
thank you .
you &apos;re , uh ...
you &apos;re not wearing your ring .
pardon ?
your engagement ring . you are engaged , aren &apos;t you ?
i mean , you just seem to know a lot about planning a wedding ,
and there &apos;s an indentation on your ring finger .
you got me .
uh , yeah , i just don &apos;t like wearing my ring on the job .
your fiance , is he in our line of work ?
douglas . he &apos;s an environmental lawyer .
oh , he &apos;s one of the good guys .
yeah , he is . i guess i got lucky .
but ?
it &apos;s complicated .
oh . hey , when is it never complicated ?
well , what does your upcoming wedding
tell you about this unsub ?
uh , well , here &apos;s something .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know why this is ,
but ever since douglas and i got engaged ,
women seem way more flirtatious with him .
and they &apos;ll do it when i &apos;m sitting right there next to him .
it drives me nuts .
i don &apos;t think you need to worry about all that stuff .
just let it go .
but we don &apos;t think this unsub is engaged .
no , but here &apos;s why i bring it up .
what if she &apos;s in love with a guy that is ?
when i moved back home 6 months ago ,
i never imagined that i &apos;d be sitting here tonight
with you two beautiful women .
at first , working together every day
rekindled the friendship that we had as kids .
but that friendship blossoms--forgive the pun--
into love .
yes .
so , tonight ,
in front of her sister and a roomful of strangers ,
i need to ask ...
nicole ,
will you marry me ?
yes !
yes !
congratulations !
ok , let &apos;s add it up .
we may have a wedding vendor
who is in love with someone who doesn &apos;t love her back
or who might be engaged .
and she &apos;s probably severely depressed
because of her physical and emotional state .
assuming she &apos;s under a doctor &apos;s care ,
she might be off her meds .
nail @-@ biting can be a symptom of that .
what &apos;s up , garcia ?
i found several female vendors who went through a divorce ,
but none in the past 6 months .
do any of them have a history of depression ?
nuh . zilch . sorry .
what about women whose family members or loved ones
recently got engaged ?
hey , here &apos;s something .
there &apos;s a local woman , nicole seavers ,
who , according to social media ,
just got engaged last night .
here &apos;s her instagram post .
she owns a flower shop , blossoms ,
and her new fiance happens to be a wedding photographer
named ryan becker , working out of said shop .
she doesn &apos;t have the physicality to be the unsub .
but the unsub could be someone close to nicole .
garcia , we need to look at people in nicole &apos;s
immediate circle of family and friends .
it &apos;s not the way , dana .
you lied ! you proposed to nicole .
i had to . but it &apos;s all part of the game .
we just have to keep playing it a little while longer ,
then we can be together .
wait , so you don &apos;t want to marry my sister ?
she tricked me , like those other girls tried to .
i love you , dana . it &apos;s always been you .
remember our first dance ,
how it felt to be in each other &apos;s arms ?
it was like we were the only two people on the dance floor .
i knew then that you were my destiny
and we &apos;d be together forever .
you know who the real threat to our happiness is .
oh , no . no , i can &apos;t .
yes . you know what she did .
yes !
do i really have to ?
do it for us .
for us .
oh , dear .
you guys , you guys , nicole seavers
inherited the flower shop from her mother ,
who died a year ago .
her older sister dana seavers also works there .
so the mom left the shop only to one daughter ?
that must have hurt dana .
is the father in the picture ?
no . he left when they were little .
this is the part of the story
that is disturbing and sad at the same time .
so , you know how nicole and ryan got engaged last night ?
well , 3 months ago , dana set up a wedding registry .
she must have known in advance about
her sister getting engaged .
maybe the boyfriend enlisted her help .
no , the wedding registry isn &apos;t for nicole and ryan ,
it &apos;s for dana and ryan ,
and according to dana &apos;s credit cards ,
she &apos;s been buying stuff off the wedding registry
and sending them to herself .
ok , so she must be suffering from psychosis ,
confusing what is real with her own little fantasy world .
this isn &apos;t just psychosis .
this is a psychotic delusion based on ryan becker .
and then when another woman threatens that delusion ,
she suffers a psychotic break .
dana &apos;s own sister nicole got engaged to ryan ,
which means nicole is dana &apos;s next victim .
garcia , we need addresses for the floral shop and for both sisters .
dana and nicole both live above the flower shop . sending now .
thanks .
morgan .
clear !
clear !
clear !
look at this place .
clutter or the constant presence of a messy room
is often a sign of depression .
&quot; mr. and mrs. ryan becker .
mrs. dana becker , dana and ryan becker . &quot;
she created a checklist with her life together with ryan .
farmhouse , a chocolate lab ,
and two kids named megan and jake .
look at this , bupropion .
it &apos;s an antidepressant .
this was dispensed 6 months ago , but the bottle &apos;s sill full .
trinessa .
metformin .
spironolactone ?
that &apos;s an interesting combination of meds .
those are typically used to treat a hormone imbalance .
it sounds to me like dana has polycystic ovary syndrome .
it can cause obesity , excess hair growth ,
acne , and depression .
pcos is fairly common in teen girls and young women .
it sadly affects one in 10 women of reproductive age .
the good news is it &apos;s treatable .
ok , but it &apos;s pcos .
it didn &apos;t turn dana into a killer .
i &apos;m not saying that .
i &apos;m just saying it might have contributed
to her becoming depressed .
dana &apos;s registry gifts .
i &apos;d say she &apos;s kind of obsessed with him .
no kidding .
we need to find ryan becker .
anything upstairs to tell us where she might have taken nicole ?
nothing .
but if nicole is engaged to dana &apos;s true love ,
dana could go over the edge . we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
african violets ,
chinese hibiscus , roses ,
lilies , and orchids .
what are you thinking , kid ?
they &apos;re all fresh flowers ,
but in order for all these varieties to thrive in this climate ,
they &apos;d need a controlled environment .
they &apos;ve got a greenhouse .
dave , you and reid stay here in case they come back .
you &apos;re just like all the others !
dana , what &apos;s wrong .
i thought you were different .
what are you talking about ?
ryan . you can &apos;t marry him .
dana , calm down .
i was just as surprised as you were when he--
no , listen . it isn &apos;t how it &apos;s supposed to go .
‭ - what &apos;s supposed to ...
he promised !
why are you doing this ?
i won &apos;t let you take him away from me .
dana , stop . you &apos;re hurting me !
you leave me no choice !
you &apos;re upset . i am going to text ryan
and ask him to come here so we can all chat , ok ?
ryan &apos;s mine !
you slut !
with nicole and ryan getting married ,
dana probably feels that everyone she &apos;s ever loved
has abandoned her .
first her father and mother
and now her sister and ryan .
i may actually feel sorry for her .
nicole &apos;s got everything dana &apos;s ever wanted for herself--
love and affection from a man .
if only you &apos;d have stayed away from him .
dana ?
what &apos;s going on ?
why are you dressed like that ?
today &apos;s my wedding day .
what ?
ryan and i are getting married .
oh , honey , no .
you &apos;re not .
yes . he loves me .
of course he does . but like a sister .
my sister .
no . he was my boyfriend first .
you two dated one summer in middle school .
that &apos;s all .
this whole love affair is in your mind .
you &apos;re wrong . just wait and see .
all right , thanks , sweetness .
garcia just tracked ryan &apos;s phone .
he just arrived at the greenhouse .
she talk to him ?
he didn &apos;t pick up .
she also saw a text from nicole
asking him to meet her at he greenhouse asap .
he &apos;s probably walking into dana &apos;s psychotic fantasy .
i &apos;m not angry , ok ?
just untie me .
we &apos;re sisters .
and sisters always look out for one another , right ?
she &apos;s trying to trick you .
but she &apos;s my sister .
she &apos;ll never stop trying to take me away from you .
i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
you &apos;re not talking to anyone . there &apos;s no one there .
don &apos;t listen to her .
you do all this for me ?
yes . do you like it ?
it &apos;s perfect .
dana ?
your sister can be our witness .
then you know what you have to do .
nicole , ryan ! i got your text !
what the --
ryan , help me !
no !
don &apos;t -- don &apos;t come any closer .
dana , why are you doing this ?
she &apos;s sick , ryan . she needs help .
you said i had to .
you said this was the only way we could be together .
dana , put the knife down .
don &apos;t you see ? she &apos;ll try to take him away from me .
and nicole now understands that that would be wrong .
don &apos;t you , nicole ?
yes .
yes .
i &apos;m so sorry , dana .
lower your weapons , everyone .
but this is crazy . dana tried --
no , no .
dana , you love ryan .
but you also love your sister .
we know you &apos;re sad , dana ,
but hurting nicole is not gonna make that go away .
you &apos;re right . it won &apos;t .
oh , my god , dana , don &apos;t !
ryan , tell her you love her , right now .
dana , i -- i love you .
i -- i do .
i knew it .
you came back for me .
nicole .
i know you would never stand in the way
of your sister &apos;s happiness , would you ?
no .
ryan , it &apos;s over between us .
you love dana and always have .
dana ,
you and ryan can finally be together
like you were meant to be .
meant to be .
