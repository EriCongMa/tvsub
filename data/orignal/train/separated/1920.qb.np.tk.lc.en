&quot; we gotta get out of this place &quot;
well , thank you .
uh , richard , happy birthday .
now , you &apos;re only saying that because you heard her say that .
uh ... guilty .
actually , can you come and find me at the end of your day ?
i need to talk to you about your surgical schedule .
oh , is that right ?
yeah . yeah , it is .
well ...
catherine let it slip that she was gonna be here today ,
so i &apos;m assuming there &apos;s some sort of something .
don &apos;t worry . don &apos;t worry . i @-@ i like surprises .
i &apos;m sorry , but ... it is actually about your surgical schedule .
bailey , you can &apos;t lie to me .
well -- i don &apos;t know anything about any party .
happy birthday , though .
oh , oh , i do have something for you , though .
owen , you shouldn &apos;t have .
i didn &apos;t . it &apos;s from the hospital .
uh , make sure you come and see me at the end of the day .
that would be great .
there &apos;s a stage you go through during childbirth .
and it &apos;s the toughest part .
it &apos;s called the transition stage .
hey , happy birthday ! happy birthday .
that &apos;s great .
it was .
you &apos;ve been pushing so hard and so long ...
you &apos;re exhausted , spent .
and there &apos;s nothing to show for all of your effort .
oh , my god ! there she is !
okay , well , she &apos;s not a she .
she &apos;s an it , and she &apos;s fragile , so don &apos;t touch it .
sorry , i &apos;m just , uh , extremely excited .
well , you &apos;re not gonna be printing anything just yet .
isn &apos;t that the job ?
i -- you hired me to help re @-@ engineer
your -- your portal veins .
i beat out 100 bioengineers for the gig .
i &apos;ve , uh , cooked up a couple of designs .
oh , that &apos;s awesome .
no , actually it &apos;s presumptuous .
until you &apos;ve read every scrap of data
on every test we &apos;ve run , you touch nothing .
there are the research binders ,
great . can i , uh , touch the chair ?
keep an eye on him . he touches nothing .
do you want me to watch him read ?
yes !
during this transition stage , it feels like you can &apos;t go on .
but it &apos;s only because you &apos;re very nearly there .
your son is 4 years old ?
4 , yes .
and he &apos;s had two previous conduit failures .
but your conduit works , right ?
from what we read , baby nathan is doing great .
yes . it was successful in nathan &apos;s case .
this clinical trial
is to identify certain aspects of the procedure .
but he &apos;ll get the conduit ?
if you &apos;re chosen for the study .
dr. yang has the final say ,
and i &apos;m forwarding your materials on to her .
number 14 looks good --
some ec @-@ tcpc narrowing with early signs of obstruction .
there is evidence of
you , uh , picking research subjects today ?
how &apos;s it going ?
uh , good .
shane &apos;s meeting with the candidates .
i &apos;m only looking at the hearts --
trying to keep my judgment unsullied .
but it &apos;s hard finding candidates that meet all the criteria .
yeah .
you need this .
what ? a ... hypoplastic left ventricle ?
no , like an algorithm --
some scientific way of choosing the perfect mate
where you input only the criteria you want ,
and you &apos;re presented with only suitable candidates .
so , internet dating .
oh , right . they have that .
listen , i don &apos;t need a date . okay ?
oh , uh , keep me posted on the hearts .
how long does it take to wash one , like 10 seconds ?
look , i don &apos;t like a filthy kitchen , either .
dirty cereal bowls in the sink
aren &apos;t gonna exactly tip the scales .
oh , my jesus .
well , now that he &apos;s in the conversation ,
i &apos;ll make sure to clean the bowls tonight .
your mother . your mother .
she does not look happy .
come on . it &apos;ll -- it &apos;ll be fine .
okay . all right .
but y @-@ y @-@ you told her , right ?
her ? i did .
how did she take it ?
so ...
... i understand congratulations are in order .
and how long have you been experiencing this pain , greg ?
you know , comes and goes .
10 years .
10 years ?
mm @-@ hmm , since we &apos;ve been married .
he won &apos;t go see anyone .
i just got obamacare .
i &apos;m a junk collector .
i s @-@ sell stuff at flea markets .
doesn &apos;t really make for regular coverage .
oh , there &apos;s definitely a mass here .
oh , it &apos;s cancer .
is it cancer ?
jodi .
what ?
oh , nothing .
nothing . uh , could be minor .
we &apos;ll know more when we get a c.t.
see ? i knew we should have come in earlier .
what did you see ? was it bad ?
if it was bad , why do you look so happy ?
just get him to c.t. and speak to no one of this -- no one !
you paged me ? hey , callie .
what happened to my surgery ?
i was supposed to remove the sensors on will mitchell ,
and , uh , i found out my surgery was canceled .
yeah , that &apos;s why i paged you .
uh , dr. torres came to me with a concern
about an intellectual @-@ property conflict between you two .
what , is this about the sensors ?
yes , derek . it &apos;s about our sensors .
look , l @-@ l @-@ let &apos;s just talk .
i &apos;m sure we can find a solution .
who &apos;s this ?
oh , that &apos;s paula .
she &apos;s my lawyer .
is it ?
is it ?
it is !
what ?
look at it , murphy .
it &apos;s glorious .
it &apos;s a mass .
i @-@ it &apos;s a massive mass , but --
oh , my god .
okay , so , we &apos;re gonna need a 3 @-@ d reconstruction and , um --
hey , dr. bailey . hey , do you have the labs on the -- um ...
i said , &quot; tell no one &quot; !
i didn &apos;t !
tell no one what ?
is that a --
yeah ! okay , keep your voice down .
i want in .
no ! it &apos;s mine .
it &apos;s ours .
page dr. webber .
why him ?
it &apos;s his birthday .
i &apos;ll be forwarding your materials on to dr. yang .
thank you , doctor .
we &apos;ll let you know .
oh . sorry .
hi . i &apos;m here for the hlhs trial .
yes , and you are --
sheryll jeffries .
oh , no , i &apos;m not on the list .
that stupid nurse of whatever she was said i didn &apos;t qualify .
i &apos;m what you &apos;re looking for .
hlhs with at least one failed conduit procedure .
that &apos;s me .
ah . i &apos;m ... sorry , sheryll .
the study is for pediatric patients over 1 .
i &apos;m 17 . i am a pediatric patient .
we &apos;re looking for pre @-@ pubescent specifically --
kids that are still growing .
that &apos;s perfect .
i just had a huge growth spurt .
this is the first time since i got knocked up
by someone said i &apos;m too old for something .
look , i &apos;m due in six weeks .
i want a heart that &apos;s gonna survive it , okay ?
and why do you need me to look at it ?
it &apos;s for your birthday .
no more talk about my birthday .
i mean , there are fine surgeons working well into their 70s ,
and i am nowhere near 70 .
will you just look at the monitor .
let &apos;s see . okay . well ...
oh , my word .
i @-@ i @-@ is that a little leg ?
and a spinal column .
it is .
it &apos;s a fetus in fetu .
it is .
the man absorbed his own twin .
he did .
you know , in all my years , i &apos;ve never seen one .
neither have i !
neither have i !
well ... hot diggity !
happy birthday .
ah , look at that . oh , my .
a love contract ?
where did grey get this , zola &apos;s barbie dream house ?
no . it &apos;s a real thing . i swear .
&quot; we confirm that any sexual and / or romantic relationship
is completely voluntary . &quot;
this is so creepy --
like we have to vow to the hospital gods ?
hey , alex , we have a transoral fundoplication .
i sent you the latest labs .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s really , really cool .
first , we go in orally ,
and then we go in through the belly button
to fix a kid &apos;s reflux without leaving a scar .
it puts the &quot; fun &quot; in &quot; fundoplication . &quot;
god , that does sound fun .
yeah . see ? you could get on that .
just sign that , and you could be back on peds .
yeah , i &apos;m not signing that .
i have a twin ?
you did -- in utero .
oh , gross . he ate his twin ?
absorbed it .
or rather enveloped it .
greg , you developed around it .
oh , wow . oh , wow . oh , i &apos;m gonna need a minute .
is it dangerous ? i mean , can it kill him ?
jodi .
no . in many cases , it &apos;s harmless ,
but greg &apos;s is the source of his pain ,
so that likely indicates that it will
cause problems if it hasn &apos;t already .
good news -- we were able to
schedule surgery today to remove it .
stop calling him &quot; it &quot; !
everyone needs to slow down .
i just found out i have a brother .
i &apos;m sorry , sheryll .
i wish i could help you , but rules are rules .
just bend them , okay ?
i can &apos;t .
sheryll , please , if i could --
my water broke . i think .
oh , boy
i need a wheel chair here !
i &apos;ll get one .
and page labor and delivery !
right away .
can i call the baby &apos;s father , your parents ?
my parents don &apos;t talk to me .
not sure who the father is --
probably why my parents don &apos;t talk to me .
the person you call is dr. yang .
and tell her to make an exception .
she &apos;s too old .
you need a refresher when puberty begins , ross ?
i know . i just ... thought we could bend the rules .
and skew the results of the trial .
no , but this patient -- - i told you .
i don &apos;t want to know about the patient so i &apos;m not influenced .
i only want to see the heart -- a heart that has had
a previous surgery to correct the defect ,
is currently in poor cardiac health ,
and is in the body of a kid between the ages of 1 and 12 .
a heart that is still growing -- is this that heart ?
so , i was thinking about this whole internet @-@ dating thing .
it takes five minutes .
wait . that &apos;s why you paged me ?
you said this was urgent .
it is . i &apos;m about to get busy with this trial .
and you need someone to snuggle with on rainy seattle nights .
ooh . say that in your profile .
i @-@ i , uh -- i got to go . i got to go .
callie , this is not something i &apos;m doing to you .
i have a signed contract with them .
yeah , that you had no right to sign .
you signed away something that &apos;s ours .
come on . we spent half the day together yesterday .
we were on a playdate .
why didn &apos;t you say something then ?
we were with the kids .
oh , we have sophia &apos;s dressy doll .
i think zola thought it was hers .
ha .
what ?
oh , like father , like daughter , i guess .
i think we &apos;re -- we &apos;re -- we &apos;re drifting here .
yes , yes , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry . that was unprofessional .
what i should have said was ...
&quot; the sensors are materials that you co @-@ developed with me
&quot; in service of research i started
and invited you to participate in . &quot;
if you attempt to impair my access to these materials ,
i will have you prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
well said .
this is insane .
you don &apos;t have a case .
listen , before anyone resorts to litigation ,
let me just take this before the other board members .
maybe we can find a solution that is fair to both parties .
in the meantime , i want you both to leave this matter alone
until you hear from me ?
all right ?
i &apos;m sure it was a shock . i mean , i was shocked .
i can &apos;t even imagine what you must be feeling .
actually , i can . i can imagine it because i --
you know what ? babe , don &apos;t . she doesn &apos;t care .
but i know why you &apos;re here , mom ,
and i could have saved you a trip .
i already called mike farris .
the time to call mike would have been
before you stood up at that ... barn .
wait , who is mike harris ?
&quot; farris &quot; -- he &apos;s our attorney . avery foundation .
protects our financial interests .
um , are you suggesting that i &apos;m after your money ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re after , dear .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
you &apos;re not gonna march in here
and start questioning my wife &apos;s character .
you want to talk about her character ?
she left a man at the altar .
she broke his heart and humiliated him
in front of everyone that he loves .
i have no idea what she &apos;s capable of , never mind you .
i am not interested in your money .
wonderful .
that &apos;s what i said when i married into the avery family ,
and you know what i did next ?
i signed a prenuptial agreement .
i said i &apos;d handle it . this is totally inappropriate .
what &apos;s inappropriate is the engagement
was 15 minutes at a rest stop on the turnpike .
fortunately , postnuptial agreements
were created for moments like this .
and this meeting is over .
jackson .
it &apos;s over !
look at this . i --
i &apos;ll sign the stupid paper .
really -- i don &apos;t mind .
you &apos;re not signing anything .
why not ? i don &apos;t want your money .
i want you .
a prenup or whatever the hell it is
is only for if we get divorced , which we &apos;re not gonna do ,
so it doesn &apos;t matter .
april , that is not the point , okay ?
this is a conversation for you and i when we are ready ,
not for her to come barging in dictating terms .
but it will calm her down .
i &apos;m part of her family now .
i don &apos;t think an olive branch is the worst thing in the world to offer .
yeah , well , you &apos;re a better person than i am .
well , yes .
and than she is .
i &apos;m better than everyone .
mnh @-@ mnh . not right now .
we can let her stew for a while .
wait , wait , wait .
le-- i -- - come on .
i hate you .
i know , right ? do you want to see ?
no . i want to work on that printer .
and it &apos;s my job to make sure he doesn &apos;t .
seriously ?
yeah . don &apos;t ...
that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing instead of this .
oh , come on !
all right . what is that ?
okay .
have you ever , ever seen anything like this ?
oh , holy god !
no , i never wanted to ! what is that ?
it &apos;s a fetus in a fetu .
that i am down here not seeing .
i can totally read without supervision --
been doing it for years .
that &apos;s not reading .
that &apos;s doodling . read .
well this has been fun ,
but i have to take a man out of a man .
want another peek ?
i &apos;m good actually .
that -- how would it work ?
theoretically .
let &apos;s go . keep it moving , people .
everybody needs to take a look because this , my friends ,
is the halley &apos;s comet of your careers ,
as rare , wondrous , a @-@ a @-@ and fleeting --
dr. hunt . can i help you with something ?
yeah , i just came to have a look .
you know there &apos;s a line .
you &apos;re --
you &apos;re serious ?
i &apos;m deadly serious .
these kids want to learn . back of the line .
thank you .
now , you notice that the absorbed twin
gets it blood supply from the renal artery .
first glance -- nothing special .
take a second look , and ... the mona lisa .
we will start by cutting through the adhesions .
once that occurs , we &apos;ll move on to the right --
we &apos;re not taking him out .
what do you mean ?
you heard the man .
my little twin is an incredibly rare find .
uh , yes . y @-@ y @-@ yes , it is , greg ,
but , uh , it ... still has to come out .
you want to destroy the mona lisa ?
no .
i won &apos;t sign the consent .
i mean , you &apos;re fixing baby hearts ,
derek &apos;s mapping the brain , and i &apos;m --
have the most amazing surgery ever .
i mean , please , tell me this is pressing --
nowhere near the heart .
hey . did you see this ?
oh , that the absorbed twin ?
technically , that &apos;s a peds case .
back off . it &apos;s the reason i live .
aw , she &apos;s mopey &apos; cause she let a lab rat loose in her lab .
boo @-@ hoo . you gonna eat that bacon ?
no , it &apos;s like leaving your kids with a babysitter .
i mean , you say , &quot; put the kids to bed at 7 : 00 , &quot; but will they ?
or will they drink all your tequila , pass out ,
leave the gas on , the whole house blows up ,
and everybody dies ?
okay . what do you think of her ?
she &apos;s hot , right ?
have you given up on men ?
no , for owen .
there is this internet @-@ dating site .
there are pages of women like this .
owen should be doing this , right ?
yes .
why don &apos;t you just keep banging him ?
at least it &apos;s legal for you guys .
you know , jo &apos;s not gonna sign that stupid love contract
you gave me .
why not ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . because it &apos;s stupid .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have given it to her .
just tell her it &apos;s just a stupid piece of paper .
yeah , if she runs , i &apos;m blaming you .
she looks like she &apos;s 20 .
she &apos;s cute .
i hate your husband .
owen said not to talk about it .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m talking to myself .
i hate derek shepherd . really ? why ?
oh , &apos; cause he &apos;s an arrogant , stealing bastard .
i totally agree .
do you ladies think she &apos;s hot ?
yeah , very .
and now i hate you .
nice .
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no .
i got to go .
what did you do ?
d-- he talked the man out of surgery .
now he loves his little brother --
can &apos;t bear to part with him .
what ?
i was explaining the uniqueness of his condition .
apparently , my words ... cast a spell .
okay , so , now what do we tell him ?
how do we get him back ?
tell him
it could have adverse effects on his blood pressure .
tell him it could explode .
tell him it &apos;s a demon .
oh , that &apos;s good .
okay , stop !
i ruined it . i @-@ i &apos;ll fix it . i &apos;ll talk to him .
what are you gonna say ?
i don &apos;t know !
i &apos;m coming with you .
this is the worst birthday ever .
oh , hey . hey , did you talk to dr. yang ?
ow ! sweet , geez .
what did she say ?
she ...
she didn &apos;t say .
she was busy .
oh , damn .
she said no . she said no .
ohh . look .
they said i &apos;d be dead by 15 .
i @-@ i dropped out of high school .
i hitchhiked . i had sex .
i &apos;m having this baby because i thought i was gonna die .
now that it &apos;s coming , i really want to live .
i want the chance to be her mom .
so , can you please bring dr. yang in here
so i can talk to her , please ?
for my baby . oh !
okay , okay , breathe .
i am breathing !
hey . what are you do--
what are you doing ?
webber &apos;s post @-@ ops .
since he got the fetus in fetu , i get this .
well , i &apos;m heading into the fundoplication ,
and you &apos;d be there , too , if you were in peds .
no .
okay , look , i thought it was nuts when mer gave it to me ,
and i knew you &apos;d hate it , too .
but , honest to god , it &apos;s just a piece of paper that says --
it &apos;s a legal document , alex , so it &apos;s not just --
what is your problem ?
in my experience , you sign papers ,
and it &apos;s a kiss of death .
you sign a marriage license , and the romance goes away .
she signed a dnr two days ago .
guess what . she &apos;s using it .
hey , alex . our guy &apos;s being prepped . ooh .
for what ?
our fundoplication .
is that the cool transoral thing -- cutting @-@ edge ,
only being done in a few top @-@ level peds @-@ surg programs ?
yeah , that &apos;s the one .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
okay , then just listen .
if you understood what the brain @-@ mapping project can do ,
you would share your technology .
oh , share ?
i &apos;m sharing now ? you &apos;re stealing it .
you &apos;re stealing it .
callie , the brain
has more nerve cells than humans on earth .
we want to understand how all those neurons interact ,
so we &apos;re gonna start with a smaller group
like everybody here in the hospital .
and we &apos;re gonna determine how
they interact with each other and talk .
please , stop .
and then we move out .
stop patronizing me , all right ?
you &apos;re just saying that your thing
is more important than mine .
i &apos;m saying my thing feeds your thing .
it will revolutionize our understanding
of what it means to be human .
and yet , you would have never had the sensors
if it weren &apos;t for my thing , you selfish --
selfish ?
here ! let me show you a diagram .
this is you .
i &apos;m an asterisk ?
no .
you think you are the white @-@ hot center of the universe .
also , it looks like a butthole .
either way , it works .
sheryll , this is dr. yang .
dr. yang , i @-@ i &apos;d hug you , but -- ow !
just breathe . i can wait .
no , i &apos;m fine .
uh , my doctor wanted to put me on a transplant list ,
but i heard about your success with baby nathan .
dr. ross , this is the patient you already spoke to me about .
listen -- i know you &apos;re only looking for little kids ,
but can you please , just --
please ! aah !
you know , just let me ... take a listen here .
oh , my goodness . thank you so much .
you have a slight murmur , but , besides that , you are well .
your o.b. will monitor your cardiac function ,
and page me if there are any complications .
good luck .
dr. ross , a minute ?
i &apos;m sorry .
she just really wanted to have a chance to plead her case .
that was out of line . i already said no .
i know it was wrong . i &apos;m sorry .
she doesn &apos;t meet the criteria . it &apos;s that simple .
i know it &apos;s hard
because they &apos;re kids and they &apos;re dying .
and they &apos;ve got their stories and lives and family --
well , she doesn &apos;t !
her parents don &apos;t talk to her .
ross , stop it .
you &apos;re too emotionally involved ,
and you &apos;ve gotten her hopes up .
it &apos;s gonna be worse on her when you tell her no .
do your job .
do you have my discharge papers ?
uh no . no , no , i don &apos;t .
i think you need to reconsider .
you need to have this thing removed , greg .
dr. weber , you said it was incredibly rare .
and it &apos;s mine .
people chuck stuff all the time ,
no clue of the -- the value of the thing
that they &apos;re throwing away .
finding treasure in their trash is what i do .
and i didn &apos;t have to dig through
anyone &apos;s yard @-@ sale crap to find this .
it was inside of me all along .
this is a wad of bones and teeth .
it &apos;s not some crummy box of vhs tapes .
we &apos;ve talked about this .
analog &apos;s coming back in a big way .
just because it &apos;s rare doesn &apos;t mean it has value .
a heart has value . a liver has value .
actually , i &apos;m on greg &apos;s side here .
no , you &apos;re not .
people do throw things away too easily .
they throw out people just like that .
they &apos;re done with you ,
and then they throw you out with the trash .
sir .
i &apos;m not gonna do that , greg .
stop !
yeah , stop .
okay , greg , i have a proposition for you .
you let me remove this fetus in fetu ,
and i promise you i won &apos;t throw it in the trash .
i &apos;ll throw it in a jar , and you can take it home .
you aren &apos;t serious .
it &apos;ll look a hell of a lot better on a shelf than in your belly .
and you won &apos;t have that pain anymore .
you can do that ?
i do it all the time .
it comes down to this .
my research is just as important as yours .
you &apos;re talking about microscopic neurons .
i &apos;m talking about giving a person
the ability to walk again .
it &apos;s just as important !
and you wouldn &apos;t have come up with the sensors
if it wasn &apos;t for my work .
the sensors were an answer to a question that i asked you .
it was my answer !
wh--
don &apos;t fight this , callie .
you don &apos;t want to .
oh , why , &apos; cause you have government lawyers now ?
i &apos;m not gonna be bullied .
you don &apos;t have a case !
my name is on the material ,
and my name is on the patents .
they &apos;re mine . you can hear it from me now .
or you can hear it from a judge in court .
my suggestion is to save your time and money .
listen to me ... as your friend .
i &apos;m sorry .
i feel terrible .
there &apos;s a reason you feel terrible .
it &apos;s &apos; cause it &apos;s the wrong thing to do ,
and you know it .
you &apos;re not used to answering to people ,
and now you have the president himself
calling you on the phone .
and you &apos;re afraid to say no ...
even though you know this is 100 % wrong .
you &apos;re a good person .
that &apos;s why you feel bad -- &apos; cause you should .
down to seven -- that &apos;s fast .
i know what i want .
uh , did you do the profile ?
what ? the dating thing ? no , no .
cristina , i @-@ i &apos;ve spent my morning trying to figure out
a way to fix this thing between torres and shepherd .
i haven &apos;t had time .
sit . i &apos;ll do it for you .
describe yourself .
no .
stubborn .
listen -- i &apos;m not being stubborn .
i &apos;m just -- - smart , athletic .
listen -- i &apos;m too busy to --
&quot; a busy professional seeks &quot; what ?
nothing . i seek nothing .
ah , &quot; seeks same , someone who is passionate about her work ... &quot;
... &quot; someone who &apos;s ... &quot; come on . what ?
fine . fine .
um ... someone who doesn &apos;t care to cook
or get out of bed when it &apos;s not a work day .
someone who sleeps so soundly and peacefully
that ... i have to check her pulse sometimes .
someone who &apos;s suffered ...
and understands suffering .
i &apos;d keep it more upbeat .
d-- to the point that i don &apos;t have to say a word .
she just -- she just looks at me and sees
who i am and how i feel ... and accepts it .
you know , she doesn &apos;t try to change it ,
doesn &apos;t want to change it .
that person .
there &apos;s a billion people out there .
but i imagine ... there &apos;s only one her .
i am happy to sign the document .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i don &apos;t have a pen .
no , sweetheart , you don &apos;t ...
actually sign it here .
you review with your lawyer .
and he will then confer with our family lawyer .
i @-@ i will consult the lawyer .
good .
now , let &apos;s talk about the children .
oh , my god .
will you have children ?
yes .
yes .
yes . i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
in what religious tradition will they be raised ?
we don &apos;t know .
we haven &apos;t talked about what religious tradition
we will or won &apos;t raise our theoretical children in yet .
that &apos;s a conversation you might want to have .
avery children become avery foundation board members .
the foundation controls $ 480 million in charitable funds
for the advancement of medicine .
what ?
your children , when they are 15,
will start sitting in on board meetings , you know ,
begin to learn the business , like jackson did .
when they are 18 , they will gain a seat on the board .
they will be voting members .
you are a born @-@ again christian , who i presume is pro @-@ life .
that &apos;s right .
will your children be taught that people
who are pro @-@ choice go to hell
or their pro @-@ choice father
is going to hell or their grandmother ?
wait .
whoa !
i @-@ i don &apos;t think anyone is going to hell .
i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s so much more complicated than that .
will they stop supporting medical institutions
that perform abortions or provide information
about abortions like , for example , this hospital ?
will they vote to stop supporting stem @-@ cell research ?
we &apos;d all like to think that the problem at the table
is the meddling mother @-@ in @-@ law
who didn &apos;t get to walk her son down the aisle .
but i have built a massive institution
with my blood and my sweat , and you will inherit it .
and , one day , your children will control it .
and i don &apos;t get the impression that either of you
has given a moment &apos;s thought to what that means !
hello , little brother .
i see a finger .
no , two ... three fingers .
gross !
where ?
he just wants to try the printer .
why does he need to ?
because it &apos;s why he &apos;s here .
and as long as you won &apos;t let him do anything ,
i can &apos;t be in here .
tell him i said no .
is @-@ is that an ear ?
an ear ?
no , that &apos;s a lung .
that &apos;s a lung .
but that is a tooth . a tooth .
oh , and that is a spinal column .
look ! every damn vertebrae .
i still want to know what you said to get him to consent .
he promised him a doggy bag .
you didn &apos;t .
i did .
he &apos;s right . it &apos;s part of him .
he should be able to have it and share it .
this is of great medical interest .
that &apos;s valuable .
you don &apos;t ... hide it inside
of ... some basement
or ... let it rot away .
you share it .
you let people benefit from it because , if you do ,
you can change the face of medicine .
oh , my god , i &apos;m gonna say
this to you for the last time , all right ?
this relationship is not new . this decision was not rash .
you only feel that way
because you didn &apos;t get to weigh in on it .
because you didn &apos;t include me in it ,
like everything else in your life .
i don &apos;t need to include you !
you include yourself in everything always !
stop ! oh , stop it ! stop it , both of you !
april , sweetheart , don &apos;t -- - no , stop it !
you &apos;re right .
there are a lot of things we still haven &apos;t figured out ,
but we will figure them out -- jackson and i.
but if you-- if you think that i am judging you
or anyone because of my beliefs ,
then i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry because i &apos;m not .
that is not me . and--
i @-@ i @-@ i would love to talk to you about that sometime ,
but i @-@ i @-@ if it &apos;s our children that you are so concerned about ,
if they disagree with you on some things ,
if that &apos;s not okay with you ,
then ... i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
restructure the board ?
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m making this up . i have no idea how it works .
clearly .
look , the point is there will be a way to figure it out .
we did something that wasn &apos;t responsible ,
but we did it because we love each other
and we want to spend every day together until we die .
i am sorry .
no , you don &apos;t have to apologize to her .
i do .
i do . we got married .
we had a wedding , and all she got
was a phone call after it was over .
if our kids do that , i will--
i will kill them with my bare hands .
we made a huge mess .
we hurt matthew , and we hurt stephanie .
and we hurt you .
and i am so sorry .
and i &apos;m gonna spend the next i don &apos;t know how many years
trying to make it up to you .
apologize to your mom .
come on .
can you stand up ?
what the hell were you thinking ?
i love her .
mom .
and i am sorry .
but i love her .
she &apos;s the one .
you could have had grandma &apos;s cake topper .
it &apos;s limoges .
i know . i know .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s lovely .
okay .
can &apos;t do it ! it hurts .
the epidural &apos;s worn off , sheryll .
you &apos;ve really got to start pushing .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m trying . i swear i can &apos;t do it .
god , i just want my mama !
somebody , please , call my mom !
sheryll , your baby &apos;s almost here .
just hang in there .
i can &apos;t !
i can &apos;t . can you please call her ?
tell her i &apos;m really sorry , and i need her really , really badly .
i can &apos;t do it . i just need my mama .
her blood pressure &apos;s skyrocketing .
prep an o.r. for a c @-@ section .
we &apos;ll call your mom , okay ?
but you &apos;re gonna have to do this on your own .
i know you can . just push .
come on , sheryll . push .
one more time . push !
sheryll , you did it .
i did it ?
you did it , sheryll .
hey , lloyd .
how &apos;s everything at the n.i.h. ?
uh , hello , derek .
i -- we , uh , still can &apos;t see you .
yeah , we &apos;re working on that .
lloyd , i have dr.callie torres here .
she and i developed the sensors together .
hi , lloyd .
he can &apos;t see you .
look , lloyd , i &apos;m afraid this whole proprietary thing
isn &apos;t going to work .
dr.torres &apos; and my work has to continue with our sensors .
derek , uh , before we , uh -- we continue ,
i should tell you that we are here
with some folks from the n.i.h. and , uh , the white house .
here we are .
gary neal , director of n.i.b.s. ,
and sid garret , our presidential liaison
for the bioethics committee , and this is
robin marks of the european brain initiative ,
and you know , of course , linda mccrary .
and , uh , i -- i &apos;m sorry . i forgot your name .
yeah , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re all there .
actually , um , this affects all of you .
lloyd , our work to map the brain is like the brain itself .
it &apos;s dependent upon connections ,
our innovation and inspiration of scientists
like dr.torres and millions of others .
if we have a policy that thwarts innovation ,
then we &apos;re stopping before we even start .
it &apos;s a @-@ a fundamentally wrong approach ,
and i can &apos;t support it .
okay .
we are willing to share our sensors with you
but only if our work continues --
if everybody &apos;s research continues .
dr.shepherd , your contract is very clear .
we have sole right to your sensors , or you are out .
then i am out .
the president himself --
you can tell that to the president .
better yet , get him on the phone .
i will tell him myself .
either the policy goes , or i go .
we will ...
have to ... figure out ...
a ... way to share .
in the meantime , you can send us the plans for your sensors ,
and , uh , dr.torres , of course , uh , should continue her work .
thank you ... uh , lloyd , for your cooperation .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
yes !
greg . jodi .
okay , everything went very well .
we &apos;re going -- - you promised me .
cough it up . murphy .
thank you .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s horrible !
thank you for taking that out of me .
take that away . take that away .
thank you . ohh .
you stupid idiot .
you want me to take that back to path ?
oh , are you kidding me ? this is my birthday present .
uh , speaking of which , i &apos;ll see you , what ,
in about , uh ... half an hour ?
sir ?
okay , now you &apos;re making me feel bad .
w @-@ what -- if i &apos;d have known you wanted a party ,
i would have -- look , uh , come to dinner with me and ben .
oh , oh , please . please , we &apos;d love to -- we &apos;d love t--
uh , b @-@ bailey , stop . bailey .
bailey , i was just joking .
go and have fun .
s ...
happy birthday .
no , it &apos;s good .
edwards .
oh . you had one job .
dr.grey , we were just , uh , looking at eric &apos;s designs ,
which are actually kind of amazing .
i &apos;m fired . i &apos;m totally fired .
listen , gary .
uh , eric .
what-- whatever .
this was my mother &apos;s project .
i took it over . it &apos;s my project .
so , it &apos;s sort of like my family heirloom .
i totally get it . i have this teacup --
it &apos;s my baby , and i failed it .
no , you didn &apos;t .
stop talking .
i failed it , and that &apos;s not okay
because other people &apos;s babies are growing .
they &apos;re thriving . they &apos;re saving lives .
they &apos;re getting pats on the backs from presidents .
and mine is sitting in a basement ,
and we need to change that .
she said &quot; we . &quot;
yeah , it &apos;s a good sign .
have a seat .
before you start printing ,
i want to go over a few things with you .
well , i &apos;m good right here .
i said &quot; sit . &quot;
so , the first time we printed , i think where i went wrong is ...
she &apos;s so beautiful .
you &apos;re telling me she &apos;s gonna
have to grow up without a mother ?
there are other options .
you can ge on a transplant list .
and maybe the next phase of trials
will be more inclusive .
but i want this one .
i am so , so sorry .
you don &apos;t meet the criteria .
call your mom .
i bet she &apos;s worried about you .
honestly , i &apos;m really proud of my boy .
he had the stones to stand up and ask for true love .
i -- that &apos;s scary .
of course , i would never tell him that .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you were quiet all the way here .
are you sad because no one celebrated your birthday ?
oh , come on . i &apos;m not a child .
hunt &apos;s trying to push me into retirement .
what ?
he started the day by handing me directions to the pasture .
and you told him where to stick it , right ?
oh , come on .
don &apos;t slow down on me now .
i &apos;m ready to start the next part of my life .
and i thought i was gonna do it with you .
if you &apos;re not up for it , you &apos;d better step aside .
and if you are , you ...
let &apos;s go .
all right .
now smile .
and act surprised .
what ?
surprise .
happy birthday , sir .
you looked right in my eyes , and you lied to me , bailey .
yeah , but it didn &apos;t count because you were being stupid .
happy birthday .
well , thank you . thank you .
hey , arizona told me that jackson put together
a committee to look into this thing for you and callie .
my god . whoops . you can tell him to stop .
you need a drink ?
yeah .
you can have a drink . - wait , well -- well , what happened ?
we overthrew the government today . we &apos;re thirsty .
i don &apos;t -- what ?
how are you doing ?
okay .
here &apos;s your drink .
i &apos;ll be better once i &apos;ve had this .
here you go .
women love you .
you &apos;ve had over 20 responses .
i narrowed it down to 10 .
you should look these over . pick three for coffee dates .
okay , i got to go talk to webber , and , after that ,
i think we should get out of here .
owen .
you could just wait here .
or we could meet back at your place .
owen .
see ?
i can get in trouble for that , and i don &apos;t want to .
this isn &apos;t a promise of anything .
you want a promise ? i can promise you this --
you can &apos;t count on me , &apos; cause stuff happens , you know ?
houses burn . cars crash . people get sick .
one of us could die tomorrow .
i promise you cannot count on anything ,
but this makes it so ... i can kiss you whenever i want to .
i don &apos;t want the stupid running around and hiding .
i want to kiss you when i want to kiss you .
yes .
i know .
know what ?
what religious tradition i want to bring my kids up in .
you said you don &apos;t -- you don &apos;t know , but i do .
it &apos;s important to me that they &apos;re christian .
i thought you knew that .
that my kids would have different beliefs than i do ?
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s a little weird , april .
transition is movement
from one part of a life to a whole new one .
a @-@ a @-@ and board meetings at 15 ?
i kind of pictured my kids in 4 @-@ h.
like raising pigs ?
or cows .
it &apos;s important that they &apos;re comfortable around livestock .
is it ?
jackson .
they &apos;ll ride horses at boarding school .
they &apos;re going to boarding school ? !
and it can feel like one long , scary , dark tunnel ...
so , this morning , i mentioned
pulling back on your surgical schedule .
you want to do this now -- on my birthday ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , hunt , i &apos;m not retiring .
you can force me out , but i &apos;m not --
i &apos;d like to appoint you director of the residency program .
you &apos;d be in charge of all the decisions
regarding the educational arm of this hospital .
... but you have to come out the other side ...
i can teach . i &apos;m good at it .
but you bring something to it that i just can &apos;t .
well , what &apos;s that ?
you .
take some time to think about it .
i &apos;d like to make a toast to dr. webber .
me , too .
what ?
not before i finish mine .
while you guys fight it out , i just want to say ...
i wouldn &apos;t be here if it weren &apos;t for dr. webber .
thank you , sir .
happy birthday .
happy birthday .
thank you .
... because what &apos;s been waiting there ...
cheers .
cheers .
... might be glorious .
residency director ?
