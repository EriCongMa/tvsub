we have credible intelligence that you &apos;re being targeted .

so that he could attack this facility .

you obviously have a mole .
what have you told , ray ?
nothing .

there &apos;s no one you can trust to keep you from us .
you had your talk .

now , there &apos;s going to be a sharp pain ...
no .
followed by an involuntary cough
causing a shortness of breath .
please , please .
i don &apos;t even know --
once the lung fills with blood ...
no .
we &apos;re going to move along the collarbone --
more specifically the medial end of the left clavicle .
it will cause severe pain .
no .
well ...
let &apos;s get started .
no .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
i &apos;ve done it again .
sir ?
sir ?
hello ?
is anyone there ?
第一季 第十一集
106号
you know there &apos;s a , uh , surveillance van
parked outside all night ?
everyone at the post office is under mandatory surveillance
till they identify the leak .
you make it sound like they &apos;re here to protect us .
they are .
so , i applied for a job in lincoln .
before you throw that coffee cup at me ,
just hear me out .
okay ? there are great schools .
there is low crime .
there &apos;s an fbi field office .
i just want to be a normal , boring couple --
no hidden cameras , no fake passports ,
no surveillance vans outside .
so do i.
but not in nebraska .
well , they asked me to fly out for an interview .
hang on . you &apos;re leaving ?
well , the interview &apos;s tomorrow ,
so i &apos;m flying out this afternoon .
we need to talk about us , but --
好心的撒玛利亚人
my god .
what is it ?
you &apos;re positive it &apos;s him ?
same surgical precision , same call to 911 .
this is the guy .
mobile psych can handle it .
i rode lead on this case .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re requesting a liaison .
our only job right now is finding raymond reddington .
this case is important to me .
it &apos;s personal .
if it &apos;s personal to me , it &apos;s personal to reddington .
he may reach out , try to help ...
make this his case .
opr is ready .
in the last three weeks ,
have you had contact with reddington ?
no .
tell me this , agent keen --
is your husband cleared
to know the location of this black site ?
no .
and yet you brought him here .
as part of an investigation .
what investigation ?
you can look into that .
all the information is here .
are you refusing to answer ?
yes .
what happened in that box with reddington ?
he saved my life and then threatened to kill me .
what he said while doing that is none of your business .
according to the report from your therapist ,
you feel guilty about what happened during the raid .
of course i do . i shot a man .
i thought what i said in therapy was confidential .
you shot a terrorist .
why would you feel guilty about that ?
because he &apos;s human .
i &apos;ll ask again .
let &apos;s just assume i &apos;m your mole .
do you really believe a little chitchat here
is gonna get you anywhere ?
you &apos;re suggesting --
controlled fear , hypothermia , sleep deprivation .
do the words &quot; advanced interrogation &quot;
not mean anything to you ?
where were you when the site was taken ?
i was on my way here .
i was late .
she &apos;s a suspect , harold . they all are .
yes . and we &apos;re turning their lives inside out .
every bank loan , atm withdrawal --
putting keen on the street is a mistake .
keen is our best shot at drawing him out .
o.d.n.i. wants to know how a u.s. black site
less than 5 miles from capitol hill was compromised .
we have problems , harold .
you can &apos;t even account for all the victims .
security cameras knocked out --
you lost a body .
how is that even possible ?
we don &apos;t know .
we think reddington had something to do with it .
tell me , our guy --
what do you got on the victims ?
seven so far .
all different ages , incomes .
he always acted unpredictably .
we could never figure out his trigger ,
only that he &apos;s trying to make a statement .
what kind of a statement ?
he never kills his victims .
he always calls 911,
allows first responders a chance to save their lives .
that &apos;s why the papers call him
the good samaritan .
what &apos;s happened ?
are you sure it &apos;s my wife ?
that &apos;s what we need you to confirm for us , sir .
i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s your boy &apos;s name ?
michael .
why don &apos;t you take mr. brodine inside here ?
and i &apos;ll hang out with michael . if that &apos;s okay with you .
yeah .
how are you doing ?
my name &apos;s don .
my dad in trouble ?
i don &apos;t know .
he steal a car ?
no .
did he rob a bank ?
he &apos;s a bookie .
what happened to your leg ?
oh , i tripped playing soccer .
i broke my collarbone .
ooh ! bet that hurt .
when &apos;s my dad coming back ?
arrange transport of her ashes personally .
i want it done properly .
and i heard , as it were , the noise of thunder ...
one of the four beasts saying , &apos; come and see.&apos;
and i saw , and behold a white horse .
the hell are you looking at ?
i want you to tell me about your friend --
the man with the apple .
i don &apos;t know . we never met before the job .
i swear . i didn &apos;t even know his name .
how did you communicate ?
by the phones . everything was anonymous .
nobody knew anybody .
we all had jobs .
tell me about these jobs .
i &apos;ve never worked with any of these people before .
i was told to be on standby for a 48 @-@ hour window .
they said i had under four minutes ...
... to pull a chip from your neck .
who told you you had four minutes ?
the people who paid me .
how were you paid ?
cash , at a drop .
where ?
it was always a different place , different locations .
they picked me up in an ambulance .
i didn &apos;t even know where we were going .
so , you had no knowledge
of either the location or a target ?
no . i &apos;m surprised it was you .
i was just hired to supply the injections
and monitor your vital signs .
how were you paid ?
in cash at the site .
what denomination were the bills ?
he paid in $ 5s and $ 10s .
nothing larger than a $ 20 .
i &apos;ve told you everything , i promise .
i know you have .
you have such a pretty face .
and a paramedic .
what a shame .
&quot; and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts .
&quot; and i looked , and behold a pale horse ,
&quot; and his name that sat on him was death ,
and hell followed with him . &quot;
hello ?
lizzy .
where are you ?
i read about that poor woman they found in albany .
sounded awfully familiar .
the good samaritan .
are you back on the case , i hope ?
they &apos;re going to find you .
this one &apos;s important to you , isn &apos;t he ?
why ? what on earth happened ?
i only ask on the chance that i may be able to help .
one of the earliest victims --
she died in my arms .
there was nothing i could do to stop it .
you missed something , didn &apos;t you ?
serial killers escalate .
this one doesn &apos;t .
the victims and methods vary .
i could never see the pattern ...
the profile .
still can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know about serial killers ,
but i do know about torture ,
and there is no one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all .
if you really want to hurt someone ,
you need to tailor your attack specifically to that person .
perhaps the killer &apos;s methods , the injuries he inflicts
tell you less about him and more about his victims .
i got to go .
wait .
i think i &apos;ve got something .
you &apos;ve spoken with reddington .
yes . he called .
he called when ? did you tell cooper ?
not yet . we talked about the case .
we &apos;re all under suspicion here .
he called , and you didn &apos;t report it ?
i will , but something he said about the case --
we &apos;ve been focused on the killer .
we should be focused on the victims .
the most recent victim &apos;s son , michael ,
broke his collarbone .
yeah . he told me at the morgue .
i looked through his medical records .
he broke a lot more than that --
broken ribs , collapsed lung ,
blunt trauma to the liver and kidneys .
the boy was abused .
these are the autopsy x @-@ rays
of the most recent victim .
every fracture , every injury the son had ,
the killer gave to the mother .
we should bring the boy in .
malik .
alone .
you &apos;ve been officially cleared .
that took long enough .
we still have some doubts about the others .
we &apos;ve been monitoring a variety of offshore accounts
linked to garrick &apos;s team .
contact the banks .
subpoena them if necessary .
i want to know whose name is on what account
and where that money came from .
i &apos;m counting on your discretion .
i think you should know
reddington reached out to agent keen .
and said what exactly ?
she won &apos;t say .
hello , fyodor .
okay ! cool out !
i can make this right ! just talk to me !
oh , yes , fyodor .
we &apos;re gonna talk , all right .
honestly , i don &apos;t understand you , fyodor .
with all the business you do ,
and you &apos;re still funneling the money
through your nightclubs , paying contracts in 5s and 10s
&apos;cause you &apos;re too cheap to pay the commission
for clean cash .
anyway , i get sidetracked .
i &apos;ve come for your banker .
who is the banker ?
i can &apos;t ...
the first time i ever smoked a cigar
was with marnie petersen in fifth grade .
funny , little , bat @-@ faced girl .
i adored her .
red ...
the bank .
please .
how about i make this as simple as possible ?
there are five bankers on the east coast
who were capable of financing a mission like garrick &apos;s .
i run money through four of them .
which one ?
okay ! oh , okay !
the money was wired from gestalten landesbank ,
the new york office .
we have a man there .
i swear that &apos;s all i know !
thank you .
okay . so -- so that &apos;s it ? we &apos;re finished ?
yes , we &apos;re finished .
oh , my god .
the suspense is killing me .
i don &apos;t like to talk about that .
i know , mike . i know .
we really need to , okay ?
you &apos;re not in trouble .
i promise .
so , you broke your arm and your wrist ?
i fell ... off my bike .
and last year , you broke your collarbone
and , uh , broke your ankle ?
they were accidents .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m supposed to say .
who told you to say that ?
it &apos;s okay , michael .
tell him what you told me .
no one &apos;s gonna hurt you anymore .
my mom .
michael &apos;s mother was abusing him for years ,
and now she ends up dead .
the same injuries she inflicted on michael .
normally , the father would be the prime suspect ,
but that doesn &apos;t fit .
i mean , even if he wanted to hurt her
for abusing their son ,
what about the other victims ?
unless ...
it &apos;s the same motive .
our unsub &apos;s somebody who targets the abusers .
like a vigilante killer .
let &apos;s run background checks .
we need to know what other victims
have loved ones with identical injuries .
beautiful . see , mother ?
some things do remain the same .
i have to go to work now .
yes , i know .
i don &apos;t want to leave you either .
but i promise i &apos;ll be home soon .
mrs. wilkinson , you have had quite a year .
three trips to the e.r. in the past 10 months .
detached retina , concussion ,
fractured jaw , and now a broken wrist .
you can see all that ?
in your file .
i &apos;m a total space cadet .
i guess i should try to be more careful .
i guess so .
henry .
what the hell are you ...
my wife will be down here any minute .
great . i &apos;d love to meet the wife .
mr. reddington , we have a dinner engagement .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s best you and i
make an appointment for another time ?
there &apos;s been a nasty bit of business --
blood spilled , lives lost ...
a modicum of torture
words don &apos;t fully describe .
i know who &apos;s responsible .
i know who carried it out .
mr. reddington , i have no idea --
i &apos;ve tied up all the loose ends but one .
to finish the job ,
i &apos;ll need all your wire and transfer records
pertaining to the operation .
mr. reddington , i have no --
please , henry . stop .
you were the bank .
henry ...
you were the bank .
this puts me in a real ... situation .
listen . i &apos;ll do anything i can to help .
i &apos;ll need time to --
you &apos;ll hear from me tomorrow .
you need to see this .
one of the offshore accounts was used to launder money
from gestalten landesbank into this dummy account in manhattan .
louis coogan .
that &apos;s our mole ?
well , that &apos;s his alias . turn the page .
bring him in .
clear !
clear .
he &apos;s not here .
find him now .
hello , aram .
what -- what is this ?
where am i ?
you &apos;re going to do something for me .
account numbers , routing information .
you &apos;re going to steal $ 5 million from that account
and place it into one of mine .
i expect the transaction to be untraceable .
what ?
i can &apos;t .
aram ...
this is a colt .45.1911 .
i can strip and reassemble this weapon
in well under two minutes .
mr. reddington , please .
once i have it reassembled , i &apos;m gonna reload the mag ,
and if at that time , your task remains incomplete ,
i &apos;m gonna empty that mag into your head .
that &apos;s really messed up .
don &apos;t look so stricken .
the first shot will kill you .
wait . wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
i did it . it &apos;s done . look .
it &apos;s untraceable , like you asked .
五百万美元
how ? explain .
i used a ripple exchange to have the fiat currency
converted to e @-@ cash and then into bitcoin .
i ran the whole transaction through a randomized
cryptographic extension at the protocol level ,
then through a two @-@ tiered secure laundry service
i know i can trust .
no one &apos;s gonna catch you .
i promise .
a souvenir .
you &apos;re innocent .
i am ?
i mean ... i am .
wait . of what ?
the team that broke into the black site
was paid through gestalten landesbank .
my contact there traced a $ 250,000 payment
to a covert account belonging to louis coogan .
louis who ?
it &apos;s an alias , for you .
someone is attempting to implicate you as a mole
by creating a money trail that leads directly to you .
you &apos;re obviously far too clever
to have accepted payment that was so easily traceable .
you &apos;re not gonna kill me .
no .
i &apos;m going to find somebody else ,
and i &apos;m going to kill them .
i never want to hurt her .
i just ...
there &apos;s this anger that takes over .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m someone else , you know ?
and we all know that powerless feeling ,
but it &apos;s our addiction to power and control
that leads to domestic violence .
i &apos;d like to share something .
first time here .
my name is victor .
hello , victor . hello , victor . hello , victor .
i was a victim .
my mother .
she called it tough love .
it was abuse .
i refused to see her for nearly 10 years ,
till i realized avoiding her
and pretending those things never happened ...
took a long time .
but i figured out a way to reconcile with her .
it has been hard on both of us ,
but we &apos;ve worked out a process .
call it a home remedy ...
... that has allowed us to move forward .
and now ... we &apos;re closer than we &apos;ve ever been .
what you said in group really meant a lot to me .
i understand .
i &apos;m , uh , george , by the way .
i know .
henry ?
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home . we have company .
you never told me you &apos;re rowed crew for dartmouth .
don &apos;t worry , henry .
i haven &apos;t told her all our war stories .
well , a few .
you have a lovely wife .
we &apos;ve been getting to know each other .
come here , you old such and such .
i know what you &apos;ve done .
i invited bernard to stay for dinner .
i have a stroganoff on the burner .
i hope you don &apos;t mind if i stay .
i do love stroganoff .
let me wash up .
you &apos;re fun .
he &apos;s here .
no ! here in my house .
wait .
i &apos;m gonna call the police .
just get somebody here .
get a car here as soon as you can .
would you like rice or noodles , bernard ?
whichever is faster .
i believe the police are on their way .
i gave you what you asked for .
no , henry .
you gave me the bank transfers pointing to a patsy .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
janice , shh .
you should never have come here into my home .
they &apos;re on their way .
nearly everyone has been accounted for , except one .
who else got paid ?
red , please .
they will kill me if i say a word about any of --
god !
what on earth ? !
who else got paid ?
henry !
you monster ! what have you done ? !
please , janice . stop with the yelling .
it &apos;s just a flesh wound .
he shot you !
the next bullet goes in your stomach
if you don &apos;t start talking .
i want a name .
i have to call an ambulance .
he needs a doctor !
janice , if you don &apos;t stop ,
i &apos;m gonna put you in the closet .
red , please .
i need to call dr. wright .
he will come to the house !
no doctor --
what are you doing ? ! stop it !
aah ! no !
henry , give me the name .
let me out of here !
janice ... if you don &apos;t stop your yammering ,
i &apos;m gonna have to shoot through this door ,
which will be a shame ,
because i won &apos;t have any idea what i &apos;m shooting at .
give me a name , henry ,
or i &apos;m gonna drag you out , throw you in the trunk ,
fly you to papua new guinea ,
and have your head stuck on a pole .
newton phillips .
janice , my sincerest apologies .
i &apos;ll take a rain check on the stroganoff .
it smells delicious .
a saw is an important piece of equipment
in this winter activity .
mother , we have another guest .
neal . what is ice fishing ?
correct .
fishing for $ 800 .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll be done in time for supper .
mother ...
... this is george wilkinson .
george is married to a lovely woman
by the name of melissa .
george , this is my mother , louise .
every one of the good samaritan &apos;s victims
had a family member with identical injuries --
fractured skulls , broken bones , torn retinas .
all of them either the victim &apos;s spouse or child .
all of them classic signs of physical abuse .
you think your serial killer
only targets people who hurt others ?
how else do you explain this ?
every one of these family members was at a different hospital ,
different insurance , different doctors .
there &apos;s nothing that ties them together .
yes , there is .
nurse karl hoffman .
he was on call every time one of the family members
was brought into the e.r.
he &apos;s a locum tenens .
he fills in for short @-@ staffed hospitals ,
like a substitute teacher .
we &apos;re getting warrants for his home address
and the last hospital he reported to .
good . get moving .
hoffman &apos;s not here .
he wrapped up his shift at 4 : 00 .
what did you find on your end ?
nothing at his residence either .
i already pulled the medical records
of all the patients he saw on his last shift .
you think he &apos;s already identified his next victim ?
i sure as hell hope not .
okay . so , you wanted a list
of all the patients hoffman saw today ?
yeah , specifically ones who came in with broken bones .
right .
well , there &apos;s only one patient that fit that description --
melissa wilkinson .
she had a fractured wrist .
i think she came in with her husband .
okay .
april 9 , 2011 .
torn retina , left eye .
how did you do that , george ? hmm ?
blow to the head ?
accidental push down the stairs ?
see , i like to replicate the experience as best i can .
oh , well . no matter .
i have plenty of tools
that will achieve the same effect .
see , george , i suffered my share of pain ...
... as a child
courtesy of the one person in this world
who was supposed to protect me .
i found it ...
inconceivable
that a person could hurt someone
who they claim to love --
and not just hurt ,
but torture ...
repeatedly .
but then , one day ,
i realized she wasn &apos;t experiencing pain .
it was the opposite .
she was actually experiencing pleasure .
see , george ...
i believe that the only way that an abuser
can truly understand the experience of the victim
is to have that experience themselves .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing here today , george .
and that &apos;s what mother is here today for , too --
so she never forgets
what i experienced all those years .
and now you will never forget
what your wife experienced all those years .
is george in some kind of trouble ?
melissa , i need to ask you a difficult question .
has your husband been abusing you ?
no .
of course not .
i &apos;m aware of your visit to the e.r.
you &apos;ve been interviewed by a caseworker in the past .
we &apos;ve had some problems .
every marriage does .
but he &apos;s getting help .
he &apos;s been going to group classes at the church twice a week .
in fact , he went today .
he was here for the meeting .
did he seem to be in any kind of distress ?
not that i could tell .
was he with anyone ?
no . he always comes alone .
actually , come to think of it , though ,
he was chatting with a new member after the session .
new member ?
is this the man he was with ?
yeah . he introduced himself to the group ,
told us his story .
told us about his mother , the abuse .
thank you .
he &apos;s taking back control
in the place where it was taken away from him --
his childhood home .
okay . let &apos;s see .
what &apos;s next ?
a concussion .
do you know what a concussion technically is , george ?
it is a blow
with significant enough blunt force
that it literally causes the brain
to rattle around inside of your skull .
this won &apos;t do ,
&apos;cause there was also a vertical laceration
along with the concussion .
what did you do , george ?
what did you throw at her ?
a bottle !
a bottle of beer !
what &apos;s that , george ?
a bottle of beer !
a bottle of beer !
of course it was .
keep an eye on him , mother .
i need to run to the kitchen .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve run out of time , mother .
we &apos;re going to have to expedite the procedure .
step away from him !
why should i ?
do you have any idea what this man has done ?
this man is a monster !
that may be , but killing him
isn &apos;t gonna solve anything .
tell that to his wife .
we don &apos;t have the luxury of your simple morality .
talk to me when you &apos;ve been a victim .
drop the hammer !
one more body isn &apos;t gonna make a difference .
i think it will ...
especially if it &apos;s the right body .
agent keen .
mrs. wilkinson , i &apos;m gonna need to speak with your husband alone for a moment .
of course .
actually , wait .
metro p.d. is looking into charges against you ,
but without melissa &apos;s cooperation ,
i don &apos;t know what will stick .
what i do know is this --
if you ever touch her again ...
if you so much as look at her sideways ,
i will find you .
and i will do to you myself
what i probably should have let karl hoffman
do to you in that garage .
do you understand ?
he surrendered himself in the parking lot .
he &apos;s unarmed .
before i call opr , let &apos;s hear it .
it &apos;s from mr. reddington .
it &apos;s evidence .
reddington reached out to you ?
well , yes . he ...
uh , yes .
uh , we had a chat -- at gunpoint , actually .
long story long , he identified the leak .
who the hell is newton phillips ?
newton .
so ...
it &apos;s finished ?
if you had come to me , i could have helped you .
we could have avoided all of this .
but now we can &apos;t .
they threatened my family .
of course they did .
newton , i &apos;ll take care of your family ...
whatever they need .
my wife ...
she has no idea .
if you could make it look like an accident , for her .
look out at the water .
just look out at the water .
the assassination attempt failed .
our asset survived.- what asset ?
you still haven &apos;t given us a name .
what i can confirm is that the person responsible
for the breach of security has been eliminated .
and who was that ?
in accordance with nspd --
cut the crap , diane .
the senate subcommittee briefing is in under an hour ,
and i am not walking into congress without the name of that mole .
well , that &apos;s too bad , because i &apos;m not giving it to you .
to do so would compromise the identity of our asset .
what i can tell you is that this particular threat
to our national security died with him .
based on what ?
your word ? scout &apos;s honor ?
for all we know , your asset is the threat to national security ,
and the effort to eliminate him was the work of a patriot .
i can assure you it wasn &apos;t .
and i can assure you that your assurances
make you sound incredibly naive .
thank you for coming back .
i don &apos;t want to fight , tom . let &apos;s just talk .
tom &apos;s at the airport .
what the hell are you doing here ?
how did things go with your case ?
congratulations .
i &apos;m proud of you .
does this mean you &apos;re back ?
i don &apos;t know .
my house is clean .
but yours ...
is not .
what does that mean ?
the deficit that i found in my organization
could not have supplied all the knowledge
required for the incursion to take place .
that would have been supplied
by someone with far greater access .
someone on the inside .
it would seem so .
therefore , we &apos;re back where we began ...
me speaking with you .
well , then .
welcome back .
where have you been , anyway ?
out and about .
did you bring me anything ?
yes .
the next name on the blacklist .
