Yeah?
Uh, Mrs. Florrick, sorry,
the other bathroom's clogged.
Okay.
Thank you.
Can I go to the jamboree?
Why are you whispering?
Eli said to.
It's something Shannon's going to next weekend.
It's a Campus Faith jamboree.
No, it's not like what you think.
It's like a social.
You don't even have to believe in it or anything.
Why did Eli say we should whisper?
Oh, yeah-- he phoned and said that Dad needed his rest,
'cause of his debate.
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.
Do you want some French toast?
Shannon made it.
Tell her about the jamboree.
Tell Mom about the jamboree.
It's really cool, Mrs. Florrick.
Like, you sing and you, like, play games.
It's really good for preteen self-esteem.
The toilet's clogged.
Shh! We're trying to let Dad sleep.
Eli said.
Today is Dad's debate.
Who's this, Mrs. Florrick?
Oh, he's a guy who killed his wife and her boyfriend.
Allegedly killed his wife and her boyfriend.
They're gonna execute him tonight.
Unless my mom's appeal works.
Unless the firm's appeal works.
I got it.
Shut up.
He's got a new girlfriend.
It's a study partner.
Okay, could you all just stop growing up so quickly?
This is really good.
I told you.
She'll be with you in a second.
Um, some guy, uh, Collagan?
Kerrigan?
I'll take it in the...
He got jealous that his wife was divorcing him,
so he burned down her home.
Whoa. I wish I lived here.
Yes. This is Alicia Florrick.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
This is Jason Kerrigan.
with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Yes. Is everything all right?
Yes. You filed the final habeas petition
for Carter Wright last night, correct?
Yes.
I'm calling to ask if, uh, you'll be filing an addendum
before tonight's execution.
I'm sorry, can you... repeat that?
Will you be filing an addendum to the brief?
Mrs. Florrick?
Uh, yes, uh, an addendum.
We will be.
Let me phone you back, if you don't mind.
I don't mind, but I'm under a bit of a...
Okay. It's okay.
Call me within the hour.
It's Saturday-- I said no calls.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Will-- it's Alicia.
Oh. Hey, sorry, I thought it was work.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I mean...
it might be nothing.
Last night I turned in the appeal
on the Carter Wright execution, and I...
approximately two minutes ago,
the Seventh Circuit clerk phoned me back
and he asked... if I had an addendum.
Will?
So, tell me what he said exactly.
He phoned me, and he said they received our appeal
and he wanted to know when he could expect an addendum.
And you never said anything about an addendum?
No.
When I turned it in Friday night,
no, I didn't say anything.
But...
Did he phone the office?
No, he phoned my home.
I don't understand-- why did he phone your home?
I put that number on the buck slip--
if he had any questions.
Where was it left?
I said I would be phoning him back about our addendum.
Good. When does he expect your call?
Within the hour.
Okay. I have to phone Diane.
I'll phone you right back. Stay there, okay?
Oh. Can I just go back and answer that?
What's up? I thought you were off the grid.
Alicia just got a call from the clerk at the Seventh Circuit,
asking if we have an addendum on our appeal.
You're hearing me, aren't you?
Yes.
What did Alicia say?
She said she'd phone him right back.
Good girl. Uh, wh-where are you?
Heading back.
Gonna try to pull in whoever I can on a Saturday. You're there?
Yes. I was just going in to see him,
try to keep him calm.
Do you know the clerk at the 7th?
No. He didn't say anything else?
No. Hopefully, Alicia can get more when she phones back.
Maybe it should be one of us phoning.
Nah, this guy's breaking the rules
trying to tell us there's something we missed
without actually telling us there's something we missed.
If we treat this out of the ordinary, he'll bolt.
He might also be telling us we have an opportunity.
A last Hail Mary appeal?
You need to get someplace where you can talk.
I'm sending Kalinda over to Alicia right now.
Good. I'll- I'll phone you in 30 minutes.
Step through, please.
Step back, please.
How you doing?
I slept.
Good.
You hear anything?
The judges didn't say anything?
N- No.
But we just submitted it last night.
I got the Warden
to agree to a phone call with your daughter.
Yeah.
That's okay.
It's been ten years.
I don't even blame her.
Ruby's moved on.
You have to know what you want to know.
Your mom?
Yeah, but you can't just throw her out there.
You work with my mom?
Yeah.
Sure.
And you're sure
the clerk said addendum, not amendment?
Yes, I'm sure.
Okay, so it's very important
you don't seem overly eager for information
when you call him back.
That's right.
The most important thing to do is sound casual.
You're just proofreading the addendum.
Keep him talking-- the more he gives us, the better.
And try to get him to point
to a specific section of the brief.
Or ask if there is a section missing.
But he might get suspicious,
so don't ask him too many direct questions.
I think that Alicia should play this one by ear.
Yes, of course.
Anything he gives us will be helpful.
Good, Kalinda. Keep us on your cell.
Sure.
You okay?
Seventh Circuit Appellate Court.
Oh, hi. This is Alicia Florrick.
We spoke about an hour ago.
You had inquired about an addendum.
Yeah.
Uh, well, I was going through our appeal...
They're all waiting on you.
Do you want me to phone back?
No, no, that's okay.
I'll be right in.
I was here going through our appeal,
and I was just wondering,
uh, which section you were referring to.
Which... what?
I can't recall which section...
uh, you said that you felt was incomplete.
Just tell him you'll talk later.
Look, I'm here till 6:00.
If you have an addendum to file,
he needs it by then.
Do you understand?
I understand, but why don't we talk later-- you sound busy.
Stay by the phone.
Well, we have a deadline:
6: 00 P.M.
Great. Nine hours to figure out what we missed,
or Carter dies.
Ladies and gentle... ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you for your attention, people.
There are two possibilities here, ladies and gentlemen.
Either we overlooked something...
...or...
we are being pointed toward an opportunity.
This clerk is telling us we have a chance.
So, we have nine hours--
nine hours to save a man's life.
Legal aid... this case came from your team,
so I want you to head down to the 27th floor
and look through every sentence, word, comma.
Did we overlook anything?
Executions have gone through because of a typo.
Lockhart & Gardner people,
we need to look into this clerk
and the three judges of the Seventh Circuit.
Is this clerk acting on his own here,
or is he doing it for one of the persuadable judges?
Is there anything in their background
to suggest where we should be focusing our appeal?
We only need to focus on two judges.
What do you mean?
Well, the clerk said
he needed the addendum by 6:00.
Okay, good, there are two
male judges on the panel hearing our appeal--
let's look into both of them.
Kalinda, what do you have on the clerk so far?
Um... not much.
Uh, Jason Kerrigan,
29 years old,
Yale undergrad,
captain of the water polo team,
Harvard Law.
He's too young to leave much of a paper trail.
But he did work for the Innocence Project in 2008.
Good, that's good.
Is he seeing something
in the evidence that we should see?
Let's look into someone who knew him there.
What?
The Innocence Project 2008?
You know who worked there?
Who?
Cary.
We have a lead on someone who knew him there.
Hanging up now.
You're not gonna try him...
Course I am.
He won't help us.
On your left, here, this is a, uh, dorm...
I think...
I have a crush on you.
That's the science lab, over there.
No, you don't.
I'm not a little girl anymore, Cary.
I'm 18.
Molly. You're my first cousin,
and your parents are trusting me
to show you around Chicago universities.
I looked it up. It's not incest.
Oh, boy.
Okay. I got to take this.
I'll catch up with you. Behave.
Hello.
Hey, Cary, guess what I need?
Ah, Kalinda.
I imagine you need something I can't give you till Monday.
No. I can't wait till then.
Listen, I need to know everything about Jason Kerrigan.
Jason Kerrigan?
He's a clerk at the Seventh Circuit Appellate Court.
Yeah, you two worked at the Innocence Project together.
No.
Yes.
2008.
No, I mean, "No, you're not getting anything from me."
This is about your death row appeal.
Oh, come on, Cary.
This is Indiana death row.
Your boss never has to find out.
Look, here's an idea:
Come back to the State's Attorney's Office.
Start putting these wife-killers onto death row,
instead of getting them off.
As good as you are at getting people off.
You didn't really say that, did you?
Good to talk to you, Kalinda.
What's going on?
We're working a Hail Mary pass with this appeal.
Okay. You want me to get Mom to take care of the kids?
Definitely, because that's all we need here.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Jim has to take me through the debate prep.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to stay by the phone.
The appellate court might call back.
Hey, don't worry about it.
Did you try the French toast?
Yep. Five times.
Peter?
Do you know anything about the Seventh Circuit judges?
Which one?
The men.
Any reason they would tip on a death row appeal?
Well, not Oxley.
But I heard that Glendon got remarried and was going soft.
Glendon?
Don't say it came from me.
You have to keep your tough stance on the death penalty?
It's the only way to win.
And there's Jackie. See?
You just have to think her name and she appears.
No.
My goodness. I forgot my keys.
Glendon?
I thought Glendon was law and order.
I just got off with Kalinda and Alicia.
The word is he married
a religious anti-death-penalty type.
Then we should be pursuing actual innocence.
Our arguments were too technical.
Glendon wants to go our way,
but he needs innocence to hang his hat on.
Yep, we're heading downstairs now.
Gonna run through the trial transcripts with Legal Aid,
see what other suspects were overlooked.
Hey. One thing.
Don't let Legal Aid run with this, okay?
I argued for Legal Aid to pursue innocence,
and I think they fumbled.
You got it.
Okay. I've got a call coming in.
Hello! I hope to learn each and every one of your names.
But in the meantime,
we're taking lunch orders for sandwiches,
so if you have a moment...
Just write your orders down there.
Lockhart/Gardner is picking up the tab.
They're gonna try to bully you, provoke you.
They smell blood in the water,
and they want to tear you to pieces.
Stay out.
Is that French toast?
Leave it. Go.
Where's my position on capital punishment?
You're not changing your position on capital punishment.
You know that Alicia's working
on the Carter Wright appeal, don't you?
You know, some industrious reporter
is going to point out the contradiction.
They're going after family,
because they see you lose your cool
when they come after family.
So don't.
You always get quiet when you get angry.
Just keep talking. Change the subject.
Ruby?
It's just me here.
No family.
There's nobody else.
Ruby?
It just... It hurts so much.
I-I know.
But if you don't see him,
I think, maybe,
in a week or a year,
it'll hurt more.
He keeps saying he's innocent?
Yes.
Do you believe him?
I-I don't know.
I wish I could tell you 100%
he's innocent or guilty,
but whenever I've been 100% certain about anything,
I've been proven wrong.
The only thing I know
is nobody should be without family when he dies.
How long do I have?
To get here?
Three hours.
They only allow visitation until 2:00.
I don't think I can make it. I'm in Avon.
Come.
I will talk to the warden.
Just come. Don't go home.
I look like a mess.
Ruby, please.
Come. Right now.
It all started when Carter and his wife Caroline
separated in 2000.
One month later,
Caroline's apartment burned down.
The fire was deemed suspicious.
Carter had no alibi for that night.
And he had the motive.
Jealousy.
Caroline took up with another man, also killed in the fire.
Other suspects?
The public defender took a stab at him--
a, uh, Frank Gephart.
Testified for the prosecution.
Said that Carter and Caroline fought constantly.
Gephart was also a former business partner of Carter's.
They dissolved their landscaping business in late 1998.
So Frank wanted Carter dead,
tried to burn him alive,
but didn't know Caroline already kicked Carter out.
Okay, find him.
Don't go in hard.
Keep me in touch.
You understand, Ms. Lockhart,
the protocols for lethal injection
are regimented and exact.
You're asking me to break my own rules.
I am, sir.
I'm asking you to make an exception
and let this man see his daughter before he dies.
I'm going to ask something in return, Ms. Lockhart.
The last hours are very hard for any man,
and Mr. Wright will be emotional if he sees his daughter.
I need you to calm him.
I don't want trouble getting him to the gurney.
Do you understand?
To the best of my ability, I will.
Do you agree to extend the visitation hours?
Hold on a second. Mr. Barkin?
The anesthetist.
I have to take this.
Do I have your approval?
Let me take this, and we'll talk.
Warden Barkin.
I just think we can get a delay with this.
What's it called again?
It's sodium thiopental,
the first part in a three-drug cocktail.
It's the barbiturate to put him to sleep.
And they're out of it?
How can they be out of it?
The drug expired.
Their executions are so infrequent, it expired,
so they're switching to another anesthetic.
Okay, I'm on my way to request a delay.
Oh, and ask Carter about Frank Gephart.
Who is that? Is that the new suspect?
Yeah, a bitter ex-business-partner of Carter's.
I just sent Blake out to get anything he can on him.
Julius, your tie.
Whatever Carter has will be helpful.
Okay, I'll ask.
But we need another week on all of this.
You're telling me.
Maybe I just won't go to college.
It's an option.
Become a vagabond. Write about your adventures.
I thought this was a weekend.
No weekend for the wicked.
Hello?
Cary? This is Barry Scheck.
Do you have a moment?
Sure I have a moment, Mr. Scheck.
Let me just hang up with F. Lee Bailey on the other line.
I...
Just... Just hold on a second.
All right.
What do you need, Barry, old buddy?
You know about the Carter Wright death row appeal, don't you?
Do I know about it? I've got tickets.
I'm headed there right now.
In fact, I got an extra ticket, if you want to join me.
Cary. This is Barry Scheck.
Yes. Yes, I know. I know.
Do the... Do the funny voice with the Barry Scheck on helium.
Okay, let me start again.
Lockhart & Gardner
needs your help on a death row appeal.
And I thought because of your internship at the Innocence Project,
and my friendship with your father,
that you might consider helping out for a few hours.
Michael?
No. Barry.
This isn't Michael in vice?
No, this is Barry Scheck in... here.
Hello, Mr. Scheck.
I'm so sorry.
I... This...
Uh, this guy...
What do you need?
I can't.
Yes, you can. Just like this.
Yeah, but I don't believe it.
You don't have to; you just do it, and it works.
It's like a genie.
Okay, I'll pray.
What's the name of the guy who's getting executed?
I don't think you should do this.
Why?
I don't know.
It just... It feels weird.
Okay, I'll pray that he won't be executed.
I just need to ask you, Jesus:
please save this man's life.
This man on death row.
Only you know his real heart,
but I just ask you that you stop this from happening to him.
Carter Wright.
I just pray that you stop this from happening to Carter Wright.
In Jesus's name, I pray.
And my dad's debate?
That's your husband, Mrs. Gephart?
Ex.
Oh, sorry.
I need to talk to him.
You have any idea where he is?
Well, I know where his ashes are.
Would that help?
What? Did he owe you money?
No. I'm here about Carter Wright.
I knew it was something like that.
He's going down tonight, I heard.
Midnight.
Carter poached Frank's clients.
Took them with him to his new company.
Frank never forgave him.
Do you have any reason to believe Frank
had something to do with the fire?
I got reason to believe anything about Frank.
But, um, no.
He was with me that night.
At the movies.
Okay, that sucks.
Well, she's willing to say anything we want.
I mean, I could pursue that if you like.
No. We got another path.
Head back to the office.
We got a lead on the clerk.
We struck out on Frank Gephart.
What do you know, Cary?
Okay, first of all, I'm here for this,
and nothing else.
Understood.
What can you tell us about your old friend, this clerk?
Jason read a New Yorker article
about the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham,
and it moved him.
He wrote a paper about
flawed science in government cases, or something like that.
Now, The Harvard Review never printed it.
It's probably sitting in a drawer somewhere.
Can you get us a copy?
Yeah, I can dig it up for you.
Alicia, Kalinda, you guys still on it?
Yeah.
You know what this is about?
The arson science.
Methods for arson investigation
have developed over the last ten years.
Track down the arson expert who testified at the trial.
See if his story has changed.
She's coming?
Yes.
The warden will make an exception
if she gets here... soon.
When?
Soon.
Ms. Lockhart, thank you for staying with me,
but I need you to talk to me like I'm an adult.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Ruby needs to be here by 3:00.
She's driving from Avon.
It will be close.
Thank you.
Now, why were you asking me about Frank Gephart?
There may be a chance our appeal is finding traction
with the Seventh Circuit.
They asked for additional material,
and we're trying to supply it.
I don't want you to be disappointed.
That's my business.
Tell me everything, and I will deal with my disappointment.
I don't care if a horse tranquilizer is just as effective
as sodium thiopental.
The law doesn't allow...
Counselor, watch your tone and your sarcasm.
Yes, my apologies, Your Honor.
The law doesn't allow
for a shell game on lethal injection.
And switching drugs
is the very essence
of cruel and unusual punishment.
Mr. Cowan, I understand you...
Please stand.
I understand the State has an interest
in making its execution date,
but why can't the State order more of this drug?
Hospira is a publicly-traded company, Your Honor,
and the only manufacturer of sodium thiopental in the country.
They're backlogged on orders...
No, they're concerned their drugs are being used in this manner...
Mr. Gardner, your passion is noted, and it is dismissed.
Please... stop.
The important thing to note,
Your Honor, is that the replacement barbiturate
is just as effective,
and that Mr. Gardner is merely attempting to stall an execution that
over ten years, has resisted every appeal.
Be that as it may,
you have other options open to you, don't you, Counselor?
If you want your execution to proceed,
then you must acquire more of this drug
from your neighboring states.
Otherwise, the execution will be delayed until you do so.
Yes, I'm looking for the arson expert.
Is this Dr. Todd Grossman?
Well, do you know where he might have moved to?
Yeah, he testified in the Carter Wright trial.
So you don't know where he moved?
Are you sure?
I just need one vial.
Sodium thiopental.
In the next eight hours.
Execution's at midnight.
Hi. Can I speak to Dr. Grossman, please?
Yeah.
Uh, is this the arson expert?
All right, and when do you expect him back?
No. It's just that it's very important.
I understand.
We're having the same trouble.
No, California's too far.
Thanks.
What?
He's getting on a plane to Florida.
His aide's gonna try and stop him before he boards.
I think I need to take a breath.
You know, you've been different lately.
I've been different?
Yeah.
It's prob...
One second.
What about the olive?
This tie is going to strobe.
And this one is ugly.
I'm praying for you.
Thanks.
Life has been playing tricks on me lately,
and I think it's best not to take it seriously.
Is this about work, or is this about Will?
There's a man sitting somewhere 75 miles from here.
He knows that in nine hours, he'll be dead.
I can't get my head around that.
What does Blake have on you?
Have on me?
I don't think he has anything on me.
Okay, I'm gonna drink.
I didn't like my life before, so...
I changed it.
You changed it?
How did you change it?
In ways that... Blake is trying to use against me.
Are you in trouble?
No.
Were you in trouble?
No.
It's just that when someone changes their life,
it's usually because they're in trouble.
Well, you've changed your life.
Hello?
Yeah?
Are you sure?
What time?
Okay.
Thanks.
She missed him.
He's on his way to Florida, but he has to change at O'Hare.
You'll have to buy a ticket to get through security.
Yup.
Good talking to you.
Hi.
Bye.
I'm late.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for coming.
How's he doing?
He's trying to stay strong.
I think seeing you, it'll be difficult, but, uh...
It's 3:20, ma'am.
I know, Warden, sir, but she just got here.
She rushed from Avon.
Yes, and I said I'd extend visitation hoursby one hour, to 3:00.
I'm so sorry. I rushed.
It-It... It's-It's okay.
Warden, please.
Ma'am, I live in a world of rules.
I don't try to cut corners.
I don't try to bend the truth.
I make an agreement, and I stick to it.
It's only 15 minutes.
No, ma'am. It's not.
I was sympathetic, ma'am.
Ms. Lockhart.
But then you took advantage of my sympathy,
and used my phone call with the anesthetist to delay my protocol.
That's when I lost sympathy.
Please. I'm sorry.
It was my fault,
Not hers!
Warden, please!
Stay here.
What?
Stay here, and don't say a word.
You'll see a glimpse of him coming down that hall.
Thank you.
Warden Hiatt.
Sorry to interrupt you on your Saturday, Warden, but I need some help.
This is Robert Barkin at State.
Yes, hello. You have an LI tonight, don't you?
I do.
We've been slapped with a last-minute injunction
because our sodium thiopental is three days out of date.
Do you have any we can use?
Yeah, I probably do. It's just that, uh,
I'm spending the weekend with my daughter.
We're going camping.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't important.
I can send somebody to you.
No, they...
They'll nev... They won't make it in time.
Uh... I'll come to you.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'll head out now.
Next weekend, baby.
Welcome to the live televised Democratic Debate
for Cook County State's Attorney.
All passenger
and put them in the gray bins.
At this time, I'll like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to Orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding.
Please remove all metal objects
and put them in the bins.
All laptops must be separated out of your baggage
and taken out of their cases.
Can you raise your arms for me, please, ma'am?
At this time I would like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to Orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding.
Step over here.
I pressed "Program" and then "Record,"
but nothing is happening.
Grandma, let me.
Grace.
I'm an American born and raised in Chicago.
I have deep roots in this city, in this country,
and I am here because I feel Chicago is in need of...
I'm wondering if I should call him back--
the clerk at the Seventh Circuit.
We've only got an hour.
No, not yet.
We may have bought ourselves some time with this appeal on the anesthetic.
How are you doing?
I hate this.
Being powerless.
Yeah.
He saw his daughter today.
Carter did.
That's something.
That is more than something.
Will?
Yeah.
Could... we talk sometime?
We can talk anytime.
No, I mean...
We need a moment.
Just a moment when things don't seem so all over the place.
Okay, that's probably not now.
No.
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.
Sorry, Zach said I could use the bathroom.
Sure.
I'm Zach's study partner Nisa.
Hi, Nisa.
At this time I'd like to ask all passengers on flight 1893 to Orlando
to please approach the gate for final boarding.
Dr. Grossman?
Um, do you have a minute, please?
Do I know you?
I'm working for the Carter Wright defense team.
I really need a minute of your time, please.
This is the final boarding call for flight 1893 to Orlando...
But the science has changed, sir,
the arson science has changed.
Yes, but the physics hasn't.
You see these "V" Patterns on the wall?
A fire typically burns up and out,
and a "V" Pattern indicates a point of origin
for a fire produced by accelerants, ergo arson.
Yes, but this can also indicate
the presence of a knob and tube wiring burn-off.
Are you in the trade, miss?
No, but I just read a paper
by a young clerk in the Seventh Circuit
about changes in arson science,
especially when applied to structures
over 80 years old, as this apartment was.
Well, certainly "V" Patterns aren't always indicative
of a point of origin, but...
You see these brown stains?
They indicate accelerant in the hallway.
And I really must get on my plane.
No, sir.
Look, these brown stains
are just as likely to come from flashover burns.
You know about the changes in arson science.
You know what I'm saying is true.
No, I know what you're saying is possible, that's all.
Yeah, and all Carter Wright needs is what's possible.
Look, you said at the trial that you were 100% positive
that these stains were proof of an accelerant.
Now, if your opinion has changed...
There are other people you can ask.
No, sir.
There are other experts you can get.
Not in an hour and not with your authority.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
You can help me.
You are responsible for Carter Wright being on death row.
It's your responsibility to correct that mistake.
You're not getting on a plane.
You're going to write an affidavit to that effect now.
You just need a moment to realize that this is the right thing to do.
Why don't I give you that moment?
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
Good, I got that part. What time do we have?
We've got 20 minutes.
Kalinda is rushing the affidavit.
We've got the addendum here.
You just take care of the preamble.
Got it.
I will phone him in a minute. Tell him it's on its way.
Are you phoning Diane?
Yes, I'm... Let me call you right back. You taking off?
Yeah, unless you got some floors that need sweeping.
Mom, come in here.
They're talking about you.
Mr. Florrick, the question isn't about the past;
it's about the future.
Well, I'm here to talk about policy.
I'm here to talk about the future of Chicago,
so if you have any questions about policy,
I-I'd be happy to answer them.
But isn't that hypocritical?
I mean, you sell yourself as a happily married candidate.
So I ask you again, sir:
has your wife forgiven you for your infidelity?
Mom, are you coming?
Mr. Florrick?
Sir?
My marriage is none of your...
Mom!
...fucking business.
Sir, are you aware of what you just said?
Yes, I am.
Do you have any more questions?
Yep, it's me.
My dad swore on TV.
Nothing?
Nope.
Will said he'd phone when they tell us the decision.
Look, you get back to your life.
I'll wait.
No, this is my life.
That's Will.
Hello.
Mrs.Florrick?
Yes.
This is Jason Kerrigan with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
I have Judge Jerry Glendon with a question for you.
Do you have a minute?
Uh, yes, I do.
Please hold.
Get Will.
Why?
It's Judge Glendon.
Yeah, it's Will.
Judge Glendon just phoned Alicia.
He what?
Yeah, just now.
She's on the phone waiting for a question.
This is Judge Glendon.
Who am I speaking to?
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
Thank you for taking my call.
You have a second?
Yes, um, of course I do.
It's just, um, I'm a second-year associate.
I just delivered the addendum-- actually,
not even the addendum-- I delivered the first a...
Shut up, shut up. You.
I'm sorry, this is the number I was given.
Jason, am I supposed to be talking to somebody else?
Actually, I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I can answer your questions.
Kalinda, what's going on?
Shh, she's still on the phone with him.
I'm reading the new affidavit
from this arson expert Dr. Grossman,
and he seems to have left a window to this being...
let's see...
An accidental fire, yes, Your Honor.
He's asking if it was an accidental fire.
Tell her to push for innocence.
And you talked to him today?
Dr. Grossman?
One of my associates did...
...and
I talked to him, of course, after that.
So my question is this.
Well, actually, you know what I'm going to ask you, don't you?
Yes, I do, Your Honor.
He's innocent.
Carter is innocent.
Look, I can order a new trial;
I can deal with the heat.
But why should I trust this doctor
if he so easily changed his mind?
Because he didn't so easily change his mind.
He changed his mind in the face of a man's innocence.
So much of what we do is uncertain, Your Honor.
So much of my day is working between right and wrong.
But this has to be right.
To do this to a man...
it has to be right.
Thank you, ma'am.
Good night.
You did good.
You did.
Trust me.
Got the paperwork from the court.
Dad.
And just hours before his scheduled execution,
Seventh Circuit Judge
Jerry Glendon called for a stay of execution of Wright.
It is expected that his case will be retried.
Ten years ago, Wright was convicted
of the first-degree murder of his wife Carolyn.
Since that time, Wright's execution
has resisted numerous appeals.
You see Dad?
I did.
He swore on TV.
I know.
It was cool.
Congratulations, Mrs. Florrick.
Zach told me about your appeal.
Thank you.
I want to be a lawyer, too.
International law.
That sounds great.
I want to get an earring, Mom.
No, I'm serious.
Just, just one ear.
Where's Grace?
In her room.
