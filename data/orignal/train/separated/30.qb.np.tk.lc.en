well , let &apos;s start with soft targets .
these are reductions you can make
without further layoffs or reorganization .
is one of them it ?
why don &apos;t you just tell us ?
certainly . annually , you spend $ 10,000 on paper products . cups .
you &apos;re kidding .
we would suggest moving to a self @-@ policing hydration policy .
you spend $ 38,000
on season tickets to the chicago cubs .
yeah , but that &apos;s good business .
we entertain clients .
we would suggest season tickets for a less expensive sport franchise ,
the chicago red stars .
the ... ?
professional women &apos;s soccer .
we got to cut somewhere .
the floral budget for the firm is $ 28,000 .
yup . cut somewhere .
we would suggest moving to perennials or going artificial .
we also suggest you no longer validate for parking .
the self @-@ policing hydration policy would be presented as going green
with fact sheets posted next to coolers on reducing landfills .
hello .
oh , it &apos;s ...
uh , hi . is , uh ... ?
uh , no . alicia left her phone at home .
you want to leave a message ?
no . she &apos;s with another lawyer .
i &apos;ll try him . thanks .
okay .
good morning .
dorfman &amp; associates .
sorry , we don &apos;t have our phones in yet , mr. gardner .
let me tell alicia .
mr. gardner wants you to start without him .
thanks . can you get us coffee ?
partners offices here .
conference room there .
waiting room .
i think this is some kind of flowing thing .
what is it ?
a glassed @-@ in waterfall .
my daughter &apos;s the designer .
we have the drywall in next week .
wow . no longer a mom @-@ and @-@ pop operation , huh ?
last time we saw you , it was in a storefront .
not quite stern , lockhart , but we &apos;re on our way .
you &apos;re walking through a wall .
oh . sorry .
we heard stern , lockhart was in trouble .
tammy .
no . we &apos;ve had a few layoffs , but we &apos;re steady now .
where &apos;s all the money coming from ?
insider trading .
dad &apos;s joking .
new corporate clients and a depressed retail market .
what &apos;s this ?
the world &apos;s 14 highest peaks .
annapurna , broad peak , makalu .
you climbed these ?
two left .
dad &apos;s hobby .
i don &apos;t know how it happened--
the outdoorsman sired a homebody .
so , shall we join suits ?
i &apos;m all right if we combine lawsuits ,
but we really need to combine .
no stabbing in the back .
you represent the union employees , we represent the nonunion .
yeah . you have something written up ?
over a handshake .
that &apos;s how i do everything .
we &apos;re junior associates .
we do everything in writing .
okay .
federal agents !
put your hands on your head now !
all right , spread out . everything goes--
computers , files , every box .
come on , rivers .
this is harassment .
no , eric . this is an arrest .
for what ? what did i do ?
maybe you didn &apos;t hear .
hands on your head .
ma &apos;am .
come on . these are my lawyers .
they &apos;ll have me out in 24 hours .
not this time .
okay , okay .
what &apos;s the charge this time , rivers ?
first degree murder .
who did i kill ?
kelli gerber smith .
oh , come on , you lost a case .
when i lose a case , i don &apos;t go pee on your lawn .
she was innocent ,
and you gave her over to that scum .
hey , that &apos;s ours .
sir , we are lawyers with stern , lockhart &amp; gardner .
we are not employees of this firm .
and we do not grant you permission to confiscate our work product .
well , given that i can &apos;t distinguish between work product in the field ,
i &apos;ll segregate the files , and
you can get a court order to have them returned .
no .
what &apos;s his name ?
ausa rivers .
it &apos;s federal .
i don &apos;t know the cast of characters .
these are my lawyers .
they &apos;ll have me out in 24 hours .
what &apos;s he saying ?
he telling them that we &apos;re his lawyers ,
and we will get him out in 24 hours .
uh , you led him to believe that ?
no . no . we were there on the furlough lawsuit .
the metro suit . we decided to marry union and nonunion .
so why did dorfman get arrested for murder ?
well , dorfman was defending a drug dealer ,
and there was this witness testifying for the prosecution ,
a kelli gerber smith .
supposedly , dorfman gave her name to his client ,
the drug dealer , who then had her killed .
who was the drug dealer ?
lemond bishop .
bishop &apos;s one of dorfman &apos;s clients ?
uh , he wanted us to take over his ongoing cases ,
just while he &apos;s being held .
he doesn &apos;t have his staff lined up yet .
he also wants us to argue for his release .
he can pay us .
it &apos;s a drug case .
first things the feds will do is freeze his assets .
he can pay us when they &apos;re unfrozen .
he seemed good .
yeah . we &apos;ll take it under review .
what was that about ?
either they don &apos;t like him , or the rumors are true--
stern , lockhart &apos;s going down .
oh , damn it .
and i have student loans .
alicia ?
your husband .
yeah , at least you have someone to fall back on .
no , no . no , it &apos;s nothing .
i just can &apos;t find the tax returns .
and why do you need them ?
you know eli .
he needs to look into anything that can be used against us .
under my bed
in a box marked , i think , house files .
good . thanks .
how are you doing ?
well , i was almost got arrested this morning .
you ... what ?
do you know an ausa named rivers ?
yeah .
very intense guy . out to save the world .
why , what happened ?
he was arresting this other lawyer ...
it &apos;s a long story , but i almost got caught up in the sweep .
he &apos;s a zealot .
never look a zealot in the eyes .
how are you ?
good .
i made a blt .
i &apos;m very proud of myself .
you know , this is the closest we &apos;ve had to a normal conversation .
yeah . i like it .
maybe we should talk on the phone more .
speaking of which , you left your cell phone here .
will called .
yeah .
he already got in touch .
okay , back to work .
back to work .
i say judges are skins this time .
hello .
mr. gardner , ausa rivers .
that &apos;s okay . we won &apos;t hold it against you .
suit up .
you phoned .
you wanted your work product back .
yeah , but at my office .
this is a friendly county game .
you &apos;re thinking about taking the dorfman case .
we would advise against it .
really ? and what else would you advise ?
mr. gardner , you &apos;re having money issues .
you can &apos;t afford troubles with the federal courts .
this is like the movies .
you have to threaten me with an audit or something .
oh , that &apos;s the irs .
it would be a federal crime to influence the irs .
guys , i &apos;m being threatened over here .
can you believe it ?
poor baby .
mr. dorfman is in trouble .
he is guilty , and his assets are frozen .
it would be a mistake
to represent him .
too late . i already am .
as of when ?
as of ten seconds ago .
congratulations , rivers .
you just won dorfman an attorney .
this is how it works .
germs enter the political bloodstream
via anonymous twitter accounts .
these are picked up by political blogs that ...
i &apos;m going to drop that metaphor .
why ? no . no . keep going . see where it takes you .
there &apos;s an anonymous twitter account out there-- upriser7 .
it &apos;s saying things about you and alicia .
well , isn &apos;t that , uh , to be expected ?
some of them are true .
like what ?
saint alicia , as she &apos;s called behind her back , is despised
because of her close connection to boss , will .
widely hated , she &apos;s given all best cases .
are we saying that &apos;s true ?
alicia and peter sleep in separate rooms .
&quot; he is in maids quarters .
she &apos;s in the master . not even a real marriage . &quot;
so , the danger is that it &apos;ll be picked by a political blog ,
and then move into the mainstream .
i mean , i can reduce the damage by flooding the zone
with bogus tweets that say the opposite .
any search engine will be overwhelmed by both .
wait a minute .
who knew that we are in separate rooms ?
there &apos;s also stuff about mrs. florrick &apos;s work ,
her competition for a job ,
and her connection with her boss .
what did that one say ?
you don &apos;t want to read it .
that she &apos;s sleeping with him .
all right .
let &apos;s find out who &apos;s sending these tweets .
thank you , mr. gardner .
my father is just so thankful .
no problem .
we &apos;ll see what we can do .
yup .
not my playground .
all rise .
mr. rivers , what do we have today ?
several motions on eric dorfman , your honor .
and i &apos;m sorry to hear about your accident .
thank you . i got your card .
i imagine you &apos;re seeking detention pending trial ?
yes , your honor .
mr. dorfman , in our opinion ,
released a witness list to a killer ,
and given that there will be vulnerable witnesses in this case ,
we ask for pretrial detention .
your honor , this is a simple case of harassment .
ausa rivers failed to convict
lemond bishop on rico charges
and is now going after his lawyer as retribution .
in your opinion ?
excuse me ?
in your opinion ?
yes , in my opinion .
he &apos;s trying to subvert the sixth amendment right to counsel .
mr. gardner is prone to hyperbole , your honor .
kelli gerber smith offered to testify against
one of the most dangerous kingpins in this country ,
and in our opinion ,
was brutally tortured and murdered for her troubles .
your honor ,
the prosecution &apos;s evidence is thin at best .
generic carpet fibers found on the body ,
access to a witness list .
that hardly makes eric dorfman suspect number one .
in your opinion .
yes , your honor , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought it was obvious , when i speak , it &apos;s my opinion ,
and when he speaks , it &apos;s his .
oh , boy .
mister ... ?
gardner , your honor .
it is equally obvious that i &apos;m a judge ,
and yet you continually refer to me as &quot; your honor . &quot;
all i ask is that you do the same with your opinion ,
and remind yourself and the court
that it is in fact your opinion .
your honor , if i could return to the facts .
mr. dorfman was one of four people to hold the witness list
that was sealed under a court order .
there were carpet fibers found on the tarp covering ms. smith &apos;s body
that came directly from mr. dorfman &apos;s law firm .
and in our opinion , he was the only one with anything to gain
if her name got out .
this is a vindictive prosecution and should be treated as such .
in my opinion .
the court disagrees , mr. gardner ,
and orders pretrial detention .
i &apos;ll see you both back here on wednesday
9 : 00 a.m. for pretrial motions .
it &apos;s their courtyard ,
you play by their rules .
they &apos;re so cocky .
it &apos;s just another courtroom ,
and they treat it like st. peter &apos;s .
didn &apos;t we agree to not take this ?
no , we agreed to cut the flowers and paper cups .
the least i can do is take the cases i want .
you sure this isn &apos;t pride ?
of course , it &apos;s pride . what &apos;s wrong with pride ?
pride built the pyramids .
and watergate .
god , those do look fake .
those are the real ones .
okay , four people had access to that witness list .
find out who they were , where it went .
rivers , the court clerk , dorfman , the judge .
good .
now , did they or anyone around them leak it ?
also let &apos;s look at the prosecution &apos;s assumptions :
the witness in this original case ...
kelli gerber smith .
are we sure she was even actually murdered
due to the case ?
and if she was , did the killers really need the witness list
to know she was going to testify ?
how do we find that out ?
go to bishop .
you want to go ask a drug kingpin
whether he really needed a witness list to kill somebody ?
well , there &apos;s probably a better way to put it .
but in theory , he wants his lawyer out , too ,
and if he could help steer us towards evidence
that would exonerate dorfman , that &apos;d be good .
you up for it ?
sure .
uh , excuse me .
mr. bishop ?
so you &apos;re my lawyer &apos;s lawyer ?
actually , she is .
arms out , ladies .
it &apos;s all right .
the lawyers are on our side . didn &apos;t you hear , tony ?
when we were picking sides ,
they got the cops ; we got the lawyers .
beautiful horses .
they &apos;re not mine .
rich people need places to board them .
one of your legit businesses ?
hey , i &apos;m all legit these days .
isn &apos;t that right ?
it is .
so you wanted help with dorfman ?
good .
i like him .
did he show you his rock collection ?
i think he just picked those rocks up off the street .
guy has these rocks from the top peaks from around the world .
everest ?
no , not that one yet .
mountain climbing never made much sense to me .
bunch of idiots who just need something to do .
but he &apos;s a good lawyer .
and lucky .
we didn &apos;t even have to go to trial with that witness dying .
you mean being murdered .
mr. dorfman has been accused of leaking the witness &apos;s identity ,
allowing you to murder her .
well , as i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware ,
he didn &apos;t do that because i didn &apos;t do that .
right .
but if you could steer us in the direction of what really happened ,
i think that could help mr. dorfman .
&quot; what really happened &quot; ?
is there some evidence
that points to the murder happening for other reasons ?
reasons that didn &apos;t require the witness list .
i own a chain of six sporting good stores ,
four restaurants , ten dry cleaners .
i am a businessman .
so i don &apos;t want you making the same mistake as the government ,
thinking that , because of the color of my skin , i sell drugs .
because that would be racism , wouldn &apos;t it ?
well , this is an exciting day .
you wanted to come .
so ...
here &apos;s the thing .
i won &apos;t say much ,
i won &apos;t answer questions ,
but bishop likes mr. dorfman ,
thinks he got a raw deal .
we do , too .
rivers found the black suv that carried this dead witness .
unfortunately , this suv was never meant to be discovered ,
so it may not be as clean as one would hope .
was dorfman ever in this suv ?
again , if there is any attempt to subpoena
or question myself or mr. bishop , we will deny this .
but rivers found the suv two weeks ago ,
right after the murder , and he &apos;s kept it under wraps ever since .
why ?
keep it out of your hands .
surprise you at trial .
we would advise you to fight its inclusion .
talk about a pact with the devil .
we &apos;re taking trial advice from killers .
objection , your honor .
this suv was kept from us intentionally .
the only reason the court knows about it at all
is because we brought it up .
it should be thrown out .
i &apos;ll give you some leeway , rivers . go ahead .
in addition , your honor ,
we discovered an impression
made on the console from a hastily written note--
&quot; gerbre . &quot;
this of course was the middle name of the victim ,
and as you can see the last two letters were inverted .
this clearly matches the accidental inversion made on the witness list .
we submit it into evidence .
objection !
again , your honor ,
this evidence was intentionally withheld from us ,
summarily removed from all exhibit lists ,
and should be excluded .
in your opinion .
yes , in my opinion .
while mr. gardner and his white @-@ shoe firm
may have the resources to process evidence expeditiously ,
in our opinion , your honor ,
the federal government does not .
not according to your own lab &apos;s time stamp .
in my opinion ,
mr. rivers was holding on to this key discovery evidence for weeks ,
your honor , lying to this court about its very existence .
mr. gardner is working with old information ,
in our opinion .
i would submit this revision of the evidence room stamp .
objection .
i &apos;ll accept . continue , rivers .
thank you . i would like to name ...
excuse me , your honor , i objected .
yes , i know , mr. gardner ,
and i accepted mr. rivers &apos; evidence .
yes , but you failed to rule .
my ruling is implicit , mr. gardner .
now , sit down .
no , it isn &apos;t , your honor .
and i will sit down when you rule .
would you like to be held in contempt , mr. gardner ?
no , i would not , your honor ,
but i would like a ruling on my objection .
you are trying my patience ...
i understand that ,
your honor , but we both know if you don &apos;t use the proper
form of &quot; sustained &quot; or &quot; overruled , &quot;
the matter can &apos;t later be appealed .
and i was surprised in reviewing your past court cases ,
how often you encouraged lawyers to move on
without actually ruling ,
therefore avoided having your nonrulings overturned on appeal .
in my opinion .
mr. gardner ,
i have never been quite so offended in all my years on the bench .
i understand that , your honor ,
but i still want a ruling .
a ruling i can appeal .
your honor ,
this evidence is necessary for our prosecution .
a conviction is necessary for your prosecution .
that doesn &apos;t make it a worthy argument .
one hour for lunch .
your honor ...
i said , one hour for lunch .
what the hell was that ?
do you have a map ?
do i have a what ?
a map so i can show you where you live .
that , my friend , was a chicago defense .
get used to it .
even if the judge kicks the suv ,
which given my courtroom performance ,
isn &apos;t all that likely ...
although fun .
we still need to undercut
the carpet fibers from dorfman &apos;s office .
that &apos;s the only thing that ties him to the body .
dorfman &apos;s carpet is us taupe dream .
it &apos;s one of the most common in the country .
good .
anything on the witness list ?
yeah .
two other prosecutors in rivers &apos; office had access to it .
they were listed on the initial filing
before rivers took over the case .
i &apos;m data @-@ mining them now to find any connection with bishop &apos;s crew .
all right , cary , you stay on the carpet .
and , kalinda , you stay on the data @-@ mining .
and , uh ...
i &apos;ll go back to my office .
yes , i do have a home .
good .
maybe you should try using it .
interesting case ?
yes .
may i help you , mr. gold ?
&quot; saint alicia is not just sleeping with her boss ,
she is also using him to get promoted . &quot;
upriser7-- a tweet .
about , uh , two hours ago .
about me ?
yes . and peter .
but mostly you .
at first ,
i thought it was intended to derail peter &apos;s campaign ,
but then i realized , no ... it &apos;s about you .
we &apos;re just collateral damage .
this is on the internet ?
yes .
and ben smith just linked to it as part of a remainder item ,
so it may get wider play .
please excuse the melodrama ,
but do you think there &apos;s anybody here who &apos;s got it out for you ?
young guy , 12 : 00 ?
but would he know that you and peter are in separate rooms ?
that &apos;s in here ?
even mentions the name of the moving company that put the bed in .
&quot; saint alicia &quot; doesn &apos;t sound like him .
that &apos;s the thing about the internet .
nobody sounds like they seem .
want to make a call , mrs. florrick ?
no , um , i just ...
it &apos;s ...
you know the movers who came out last week to put in the bed ?
your apartment ? yes .
is there any way cary could &apos;ve heard about that ?
heard the movers put in another bed ?
yes .
no .
no , i don &apos;t mean on purpose .
i &apos;m discreet , mrs. florrick .
yes , of course .
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s just , you know , the bluetooth .
sometimes you can be near someone ...
never mind . forget it .
yes , hello . um , can you stop mr. gold from leaving ?
i think he left ...
my mistake . uh , never mind .
kalinda .
what &apos;s up ?
can you come into my office ?
certainly , ma &apos;am .
can you look inside that bag ?
where did that come from ?
i have no idea .
$ 200,000 and the vague whiff of marijuana .
what did you say to him ?
bishop ?
nothing . we just asked about the murder .
what &apos;s up ?
and why does it smell like a frat house in here ?
bishop ?
our best guess .
i &apos;ll make the call .
it &apos;s your retainer .
i didn &apos;t know you were hiring .
i &apos;m not .
i need new lawyers .
don &apos;t you already have representation ?
in jail .
i need someone now .
business is piling up .
this is a bit unorthodox .
we represent your current lawyer .
yes . my experience is lawyers are good
at making the unorthodox orthodox .
why us ?
one of my aides saw him in court .
i was off @-@ script .
nice touch bringing the black guy .
for your information , i &apos;m an equity partner .
where you from ?
none of your business .
i have a corporation ,
a large one ,
with a lot of employees .
and they sometimes get into trouble .
i need a firm to look after their interests and mine .
help me make the best financial and legal decisions .
i pay well . i pay on time .
and i help those who help me .
you have a dui
involving the baja fund ceo .
i could tell you things that would
help you with the arresting officer .
i met your husband once .
taller than i expected .
yes , he is tall .
electronic monitoring &apos;s a bitch , isn &apos;t it ?
they don &apos;t validate .
how can they not validate ?
they &apos;re going to argue about this ,
then they &apos;re going to say &quot; yes . &quot;
maybe .
no . no &quot; maybe &quot;
money makes things predictable ,
so here &apos;s your signing bonus :
this rivers-- i have something .
it isn &apos;t the same as sheffrin @-@ marks .
you don &apos;t even believe that .
how &apos;s it different ?
you know how many kids died from their asthma medicine ?
oh , my god , the sophistry here is just blinding .
sheffrin @-@ marks has white employees in suits .
bishop &apos;s crew has african @-@ american men ...
don &apos;t try to sell this on the back of racism !
sheffrin @-@ marks didn &apos;t set out to murder anyone .
shane marx , paul din ,
johnathan graham-- all murderers .
accused murderers .
now who &apos;s the sophist ?
we &apos;re not in a court of law , diane .
it &apos;s just you and me .
we represent murderers .
we get them off .
no . we keep the courts honest .
and why shouldn &apos;t the courts be kept honest about bishop ?
everybody deserves representation .
does that stop suddenly when it comes to ...
a criminal organization
whose sole purpose is to sell drugs
and to murder to control territory ?
sure . put it any way you want , it &apos;s still a true statement .
we &apos;re doing this for the money .
of course we are .
we &apos;re not a charity .
we do this or we lay off half of acquisitions .
that &apos;s ten lawyers and ten families .
not to mention your season tickets .
i &apos;m sorry .
he gave a parting piece of information about rivers .
what ?
rivers was sleeping with kelli gerber smith ,
the murdered witness .
objection , your honor .
overruled .
how &apos;s that , mr. gardner ? do you approve of that ?
i do . thank you , your honor .
so , if there are no more pretrial motions
maybe we can move this along .
actually , the defense requests that ausa rivers be disqualified
as prosecution &apos;s representative .
on what grounds ?
that &apos;s my question , mr. rivers .
yes , your honor .
on what grounds , mr. gardner ?
your honor ,
this is a signed affidavit from the clerk
at the lake avenue motel saying that mr. rivers
spent the night with kelli gerber smith
on nine occasions .
relevance , your honor ?
your honor , do i even need to respond ?
is this true , counselor ?
uh , your honor ...
answer the question , mr. rivers .
yes .
but i assure your honor that it will in no way affect
my ability to prosecute this case .
motion denied , mr. gardner .
however , i am reconsidering the suv .
how did you find that out ?
how ? inside source .
too bad it didn &apos;t disqualify rivers .
we didn &apos;t want it to .
it undercut the judge &apos;s trust in rivers
and got her to kick the suv .
cary .
do you have a second ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
are you tweeting about me ?
am i tweeting about you ?
are you upriser7 ?
what are you talking about ?
someone &apos;s gossiping online about me .
and you thought it was me ?
yeah .
yeah , thanks . yeah , it &apos;s good to be working with you , too .
hello ?
in here , hon .
how was work ?
where &apos;s ... ?
in the shower . kids are in bed .
i let them watch a little tv .
have you ever seen when a stranger calls ?
the movie ?
a long time ago . hmm .
we just traced the ip address for the last anonymous tweet .
and ?
it &apos;s coming from inside the house .
no , just a bit of an emergency .
rivers found another way to get the suv in .
through the gps .
so i &apos;ll need you to come in . sorry .
no , it &apos;s all right .
um , i &apos;ll probably be half an hour .
great . thanks .
no problem .
is that will ?
yes . i have to go back in .
so what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe one of them is angry .
either about me running again or ...
or me at work .
yeah .
do you really think it &apos;s possible that our children would do that ?
it &apos;s crazy , peter .
maybe someone was using our wi @-@ fi without us knowing ?
eli &apos;s checking it .
but we still have to talk to them .
i &apos;ll do it .
tomorrow .
all @-@ nighter ?
no , just a few more hours .
i found condoms in your bedside table .
i was looking for your letter opener .
i thought maybe they belonged to zach .
you know , you found them in his room .
but then i thought , you wouldn &apos;t take them .
you &apos;d have a sensible conversation with him about responsibility .
so then , i thought they were yours .
but that didn &apos;t make sense because you have an iud .
i had it removed .
oh , really ?
so condoms do make sense ?
they do .
for who ?
check it , peter .
i said i was looking for your letter opener .
i have other drawers , too .
did you check these ones ?
i said that i was looking ...
how about over here ?
did you check this drawer ?
what is it you need to hear from me ?
i will never touch another woman again .
what do you want , a prize , peter ?
it seems to be the minimum prerequisite .
for both of us .
then trust me .
then don &apos;t go to work tonight .
trust me .
but the gps isn &apos;t the same as the suv in our opinion .
it &apos;s contained in the suv in my opinion .
but the data is separate and tracked through satellite imaging ...
which is only accessed through the suv , which was thrown out !
your honor , the gps shows
this suv drove right from mr. dorfman &apos;s office
to the site where the body was dumped on the night of the murder .
you have no proof my client was in the suv
or at his office at those times !
this isn &apos;t about mr. dorfman pulling the trigger .
we don &apos;t need to prove that , your honor , in our opinion .
this is about whether or not he was complicit in the witness &apos; death .
and the inference is that ...
was the gps factory installed ?
what ? i don &apos;t know .
how is that relevant , mr. gardner ?
if the gps was installed at the factory , it should be considered
part of the automobile regardless of whether or not the tracking
information was pulled from satellite technology .
the gps was manufactured by botheon , incorporated , your honor .
not general motors .
a separate corporate entity
that uses separate satellites that gather information .
therefore , we should be able to introduce this information into evidence .
overruled , mr. gardner .
the gps data is allowed into evidence .
we &apos;re still looking for ways to undercut the gps ,
but we need to know :
were you at your law office that night ?
the night of the murder ? yes .
but you didn &apos;t talk to or see any of the bishop crew ?
no .
then why were they at your office ?
because this gps has them at your office .
i don &apos;t know . they could &apos;ve been parked there for all we know .
all &quot; we &quot; know ? who &apos;s we ?
we .
dad and me .
you were there ?
yes .
okay , we &apos;ll try to do what we can to undercut the gps .
thanks .
mrs. florrick .
could you stay a minute ?
no , tammy . we &apos;re fine .
your daughter had access to the witness list and she leaked it to bishop .
why ?
to win the case ?
i had a struggling firm .
she wanted to show bishop we could handle his business .
and you , you knew ?
well , then that &apos;s your defense .
no .
you even think of using her to free me , and i &apos;ll confess .
she &apos;s not my client .
i am your client and i will confess .
eric , this ... i don &apos;t think you understand .
with that information , bishop will kill her .
no . he knows if he moves against her ,
i &apos;ll tell rivers everything .
i &apos;ve got some files socked away ,
and attorney @-@ client privilege be damned .
then what are you going to do ?
because if i found out your daughter leaked the witness list ,
rivers can &apos;t be far behind .
will you take a message to bishop for me ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
i won &apos;t have a talk .
no scolding , no mothering , just ...
i want to know .
well , i don &apos;t tweet .
y @-@ you guys think that ... ?
mom , this is stupid .
don &apos;t say &quot; stupid . &quot;
there were two ip addresses used :
the internet at your school and here .
i can &apos;t believe this .
this is like a police state .
don &apos;t be melodramatic .
i &apos;m asking you a question .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re not saying &quot; no . &quot;
grace , don &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t do this ?
you didn &apos;t write these things ?
mom !
what ?
let &apos;s at least pretend
we know what happened here the last six months .
that was different .
we didn &apos;t tell you about the pictures ,
because they were trying to hurt you .
it was a lie , zack .
and not one .
it was over and over again .
but a lie like lying about having jews in your basement .
you know , like , with the nazis .
let &apos;s trust each other again .
my defenses are down .
let &apos;s go . just tell me .
i told you .
he did it .
that &apos;s the way he and becca talk all the time .
uh , not really how i wanted it to , but ...
yeah , i know what you mean .
i don &apos;t know ...
becca ?
she &apos;s still in class .
will you excuse us , ladies ?
it &apos;s okay .
have you got a problem ?
that depends , upriser7 ?
oh , so what are you , like , the internet police ?
no , just an interested bystander
who wants to protect his six @-@ figure income .
so , you and zack talk a lot .
he talks a lot about his parents , is that it ?
oh , no .
have i been a bad girl ?
no ,
dear becca , because that would only
make you want to do it again .
you know what you &apos;ve been ?
gum on the bottom of my shoe .
spoiled little brat who will get pregnant at 17,
have an abortion at 18
and meet some sweaty frat boy over spring break ,
and work as a dental hygienist until the day you die .
and you ...
you &apos;re a perv .
you better get your story straight , perv .
oh , mr. gold . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t worry , officer .
just a daughter of a friend of mine .
she &apos;s all right now .
aren &apos;t you , becca ?
i &apos;m good .
see , i have a lot of friends ,
i &apos;m sure you do , too , but only difference is ,
my friends are not in homeroom .
so i want you to listen to me .
stop tweeting .
if you tweet ,
i will know you tweet and i will ...
have you seen drag me to hell ?
it will be just like that .
do you understand ?
i want to hear the words .
i understand .
good . and enjoy high school .
it really is the best time of your life .
this way , gentlemen .
my name is tony gurstelle ,
and i am guiltyof the murder of kelli gerber ...
he &apos;s surrendering himself freely !
get out of my way !
i acted alone and with no consultation from anybody else .
i had no access to the witness list
or any other information other than my own .
i don &apos;t have anything further to add ...
what kind of deal did you make ?
you got your murderer .
come on , what kind of deal did you make with bishop ?
do you expect an answer ? really ?
what kind of deals do you make every day ?
with drug dealers , killers ?
i am in pursuit of the good .
you &apos;re in pursuit of your own sanctity .
take your suspect .
he killed your girlfriend .
you won .
you wake up with fleas , counselor .
you pay your rent ,
you go to your restaurants ,
but you still wake up with fleas .
i &apos;m firing you .
no reflection on your work .
i just feel more comfortable with dorfman .
and keeping the evidence he has on you secret ?
well , that doesn &apos;t hurt .
good work on his defense , by the way .
good work on your deal .
dorfman keeps everything he knows under wraps
and you turn over the murderer .
well , we only ended up there because of your defense .
look , we can work with dorfman and share your business .
no , thanks .
i need an up @-@ and @-@ comer .
someone who &apos;s hungry .
you don &apos;t think we &apos;re hungry ?
not like dorfman .
guy &apos;s a mountain climber .
sorry it didn &apos;t work out .
so , i &apos;m pitching our firm to this drug dealer .
i &apos;m telling him we &apos;ll validate for parking again .
they don &apos;t teach you that at law school .
and he said , no .
he said he looked at our financials
and he thinks we have a year left .
so what are we going to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
lay off acquisitions ?
or split up .
do you want that ?
it &apos;s an option .
i take my people , you take yours .
or we could shop for another drug dealer .
hey , they &apos;re the only ones making money these days .
or find a third partner .
how does that work ?
find a replacement for stern .
bring him in as equal partner .
somebody with a client list , some equity .
you &apos;re okay with giving up a third ?
of what , a sinking ship ?
sure .
we &apos;ll kill each other if we don &apos;t find a referee .
a third partner ?
someone neutral , someone we both agree on ?
an optimism fills the void .
i think that &apos;s alcohol .
just as good .
you sure ?
yeah .
come on . let &apos;s go before i change my mind .
just wait .
come on . let &apos;s go .
just one second .
