hello , ross ? it &apos;s emily here .
i know this is out of the blue ,
but i &apos;m getting married tomorrow .

and i &apos;m wondering if we made a mistake giving up so fast .
are you thinking about me ?
no , of course you &apos;re not .
but if you are , call me tonight .
okay , bye .
where we going ?
this witness won &apos;t return my calls . we &apos;ll surprise him coming home .
surprise him ? we &apos;re not gonna make anybody mad , are we ?
come on , man .
you gonna squeeze the perp &apos;s shoes a bit before he lawyers up ?
he &apos;s a witness , not a perp . and no one talks like that .
yeah . no one talks like that .
oh , what , like you &apos;re mr. cop ?
i &apos;m more cop than you two .
how do you figure that ?
i &apos;m in the front seat , okay ?
i &apos;m gary &apos;s partner .
when you say &quot; partner , &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound cop.it sounds gay .
jealous .
hey , we &apos;re undercover here .
oh , yeah . no problem .
ross !
sorry .
there .
hey , gary . who am l ?
phone home .
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors .
what &apos;s up with that , serpico ?
&quot; what &apos;s up with that , serpico ? &quot;
are you thinking about me ?
no , of course you &apos;re not .
but if you are , call me tonight .
okay , bye .
no .
i know !
thank god you were here . we have to erase that .
what ? we can &apos;t do that .
we have to .
what if ross hears that ... and calls her back and they get back together ?
is that what you want ?
ross back with that controlling ... neurotic , crazy emily ?
the emily that wouldn &apos;t let him see you ?
no ! oh , no , no .
god , no ! he should not get back with her .
i know that , you know that . even ross knows that .
but we have no right to erase his message .
look , i &apos;m his sister
and i love him . i don &apos;t want to see him get hurt .
doesn &apos;t that give me the right to control him ?
help him ?
he &apos;s not the one who needs help .
she &apos;s obviously unstable .
she &apos;s thinking about running out on her wedding day .
okay , fine . but look at the position she &apos;s putting him in .
and what &apos;s he gonna do ?
run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ?
who would do that ?
okay , fine . all right . but that was different .
although it did involve a lot of the same people .
this is some twisted joke she &apos;s playing on him .
you are crazy .
she sounded genuinely upset .
i mean , listen .
your messages have been erased .
no !
well , that worked out well .
margarita ?
okay , but we &apos;re safe , right ? nothing bad &apos;s gonna go down .
no . but that reminds me . sign this .
what is it ?
it just says you can &apos;t sue if you scrape your knee ... or get your head blown off .
oh , hurry up . i want to sign that .
here he comes .
what is he doing ? what the hell is he doing ?
what is it ?
ls everything okay ?
what ?
he sees us . don &apos;t move . and don &apos;t look at him !
hey , it &apos;s okay . it was just a car backfire .
hey , look at that . you tried to save your buddy .
you see that ? you see what he did ?
you okay , man ?
thanks , joey .
hello ?
hi .
you all right ?
we should go .
no , wait .
oh , yeah . right .
no . monica .
monica , we have to fix this .
what can we do ? you erased the message .
yeah , but maybe i could call his machine and re @-@ create the message .
all right , okay ....
hello , ross , this is rachel emily .
god ,
what is it with those two names ?
i do so wanted to say that i &apos;m going to be ...
getting married to another british person .
and i &apos;m having doubts and scones ....
oh god
i can &apos;t remember what she said .
yeah , that &apos;s the problem with this plan .
rachel , come on . the message is erased , there &apos;s nothing we can do .
he &apos;s never gonna find out .
i could tell him about it .
if you want to be rational , i can &apos;t argue with you .
all right ? fine , tell him . i just don &apos;t want to be a part of it .
maybe that &apos;s emily leaving the exact same message .
hey , ross , it &apos;s you . i just want you to remember this feeling .
you are lucky to be alive .
so live every day to the fullest .
love yourself , okay ?
and also get stamps . bye .
play that message for emily , and this problem goes away .
right ?
anybody want to meet a hero ?
john glenn is here ?
no . joey .
joey &apos;s never been in outer space .
we had the most incredible night .
we &apos;re in the car
wait . hold on .
hi .
hi .
okay , go ahead .
so we &apos;re in the car ,
and bang !
a shot was fired .
and joey , with no regard for his own safety ... throws himself on me .
my god !
it was a car backfire .
but he didn &apos;t know that.yeah , i didn &apos;t know that .
it could just as easily have been a bullet .
ever think about joining the force ? we could use a guy like you .
who jumps at loud noises .
wow . i could have died tonight .
yeah , if the car that backfired had run over you !
i &apos;m gonna go home , before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .
i do have a newfound respect for life .
oh , my god !
ross , i could have told you you weren &apos;t gonna die today .
what ? you know when i &apos;m gonna die ?
you want to get some dinner ?
sure .
you know what ? if i heard a shot right now , i &apos;d throw my body on you .
maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood .
bye .
cut it out .
i &apos;d hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day .
why &apos;d you take off ?
just going for a walk.around the living room , whatever .
ls something wrong ?
no . no , i &apos;m just tired.you know , from the walk
okay
you dove in front of ross !
ross !
that &apos;s what this is about .
oh , my god . you hate ross !
i don &apos;t hate ross.of course you do .
i saved him . you &apos;re mad at me . it adds up .
you want ross out of the picture.what picture ?
i don &apos;t know . but i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m hearing .
i &apos;m glad you saved ross in the car backfire .
but it could &apos;ve been a bullet.and you didn &apos;t try to save me .
you &apos;re upset because you think i chose ross over you .
no ,
i knew you could take care of yourself .
you know ? i mean , ross needs help . he &apos;s not &quot; street &quot; like us .
you &apos;d risk your life for ross before you would for me .
that &apos;s the bottom line .
no , not exactly .
all right , look.i wasn &apos;t trying to save ross .
my sandwich was next to ross .
i was trying to save my sandwich .
from a bullet ?
i know it doesn &apos;t make much sense .
&quot; much &quot; sense ?
look , it was instinct ! i just went for it .
you risked your life for a sandwich ?
i know it sounds crazy ...
... but this is the greatest sandwich in the world !
so you didn &apos;t choose ross before me ?
no . i would never do that .
you &apos;re like my brother .
really ?
yeah.in fact , to prove how much you mean to me ....
here .
thanks .
easy , it &apos;s not a hot dog !
how good is that ?
see ?
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re showing me how much i mean to you .
with a bite .
jeez !
what are you doing here ?
hey , you know what ? you are in our apartment all the time ! this is just a drop in the bucket , mister !
it doesn &apos;t matter . the important thing is that you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re my friend and you &apos;re here .
okay , just a little scared . what &apos;s going on ?
the most amazing thing happened tonight .
i thought my number was up .
i had an actual near @-@ death experience .
what happened ?
we were on the ride @-@ along with gary
and somebody took a shot at me !
really ?
no . a car backfired .
but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .
and , rach ... i survived !
and i was filled with this great respect for life .
i want to experience every moment .
i want to seize every opportunity .
i am seeing everything so clearly now .
because a car backfired ?
okay . why are you here ?
i don &apos;t know how this fits into your whole &quot; seizing &quot; thing ...
... but emily called you today .
you talked to her ?
she left a message .
but it kind of got erased .
i mean , there &apos;s something wrong with your machine .
what did she say ?
something about having second thoughts about the wedding ...
... and did you guys make a mistake breaking up ?
and she wants you to call her .
that was a good thing that i told you , right ?
yeah . yes . of course .
okay , thank you . thank you .
because i &apos;m gonna go tell monica i was right .
because she didn &apos;t want not important .
point is , i was right . your decision .
okay ? } i was right.your decision .
right .
i guess i should call emily .
no , that &apos;s not the right decision.that &apos;s not right .
ross , come on !
i mean ... that woman made you miserable !
do you really want to get back into that ?
okay , look . yesterday ... i wouldn &apos;t have even considered calling her back .
but my ex @-@ wife calls on the same day ... i have a near @-@ death experience ?
that &apos;s gotta mean something .
that was not a near @-@ death experience . that was barely an experience .
you weren &apos;t there !
maybe this is something that i &apos;m supposed to seize , you know ?
okay . you know what ?
maybe this is not about seizing stuff .
maybe this is about escaping stuff .
okay ? look at today.i mean , you escaped
... death .
and maybe this is a chance for you to escape ... getting back together with emily .
that does make sense .
because i do want to seize some opportunity ... but i really don &apos;t want to see or talk to her .
well , there you go !
yeah , maybe today &apos;s just ... &quot; close call &quot; day .
hey , thanks , rach .
oh , honey . no problem .
wait , wait . the message is blinking .
maybe you didn &apos;t erase it .
hey , ross , it &apos;s you
that &apos;s an old message .
nobody needs to hear that . yes
hey , was monica here ?
yeah .
i want my money back .
you probably need that for stamps , right ?
has gary ever been shot at for real ?
yes , once .
a little .
he kind of did it to himself.it &apos;s not really a good story .
i wonder how i &apos;d react under fire
and not backfire ... but heavy fire .
like , if i was in a war .
man , i would be great in a war !
i think i &apos;d make a fantastic military leader .
i mean , i know i &apos;d make general before any of you guys .
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?
i know joey would be
in the foxhole protecting all of us .
if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .
yeah , hero sandwiches .
you all know i &apos;m a pacifist , so i &apos;m not interested in war in any way .
but when the revolution comes , i &apos;ll have to destroy you all .
