第五季 第七集
hey . uh , where &apos;d you get these burritos ?
from the spot on the corner ?
mmm . yeah , the spot on the corner .
you know i helped a lady give birth in the kitchen ?
that &apos;s disgusting .
a baby in the middle of the place .
i knew that wasn &apos;t going to stop you .
disgusting .
you didn &apos;t tell us you delivered a baby .
baby &apos;s perfectly fine .
but let &apos;s just say i did not do a good job .
oh , reagan . what &apos;s up ?
hey . so , uh , i just jogged past a guy
that &apos;s offering donkey rides for $ 50 .
feel like that &apos;s too much for a donkey ride , right ?
it &apos;s a dog , not a donkey .
i know that guy . his name is ...
his name is stan .
stan . s @-@ t @-@ a @-@ n.
his dog &apos;s name &apos;s cheerio .
hold on .
it &apos;s not a donkey .
um , it &apos;s a dog .
okay .
that was painful , nick .
it &apos;s like watching cece make a bed .
just give me the sheet !
i can &apos;t be normal around reagan .
she &apos;s too hot and mysterious .
i mean , i haven &apos;t peed in four days ,
which is alarming because i have been drinking constantly .
yep . nothing .
the fact of the matter is ,
is that she don &apos;t want to hang out with us .
she &apos;s our roommate , but she being straight up discourteous .
reagan , why don &apos;t you join the fiesta , huh ?
i &apos;ll make up a pitcher of margaritas .
that &apos;s tempting , but , uh ,
if i have one margarita , i &apos;ll have eight ;
and if i have eight , end up riding that donkey
all the way to santa monica , so ...
it &apos;d be great to watch you ride a donkey !
thanks , but no , thanks .
there &apos;s extra toilet paper
in the bathroom ! it &apos;s ...
are you hiding toilet paper again ?
i can &apos;t do this .
did she hit us with a &quot; no , thanks &quot; ?
how about this ? no , thanks , to your &quot; no , thanks . &quot;
here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do--
i &apos;m gonna make her hang out with us
whether she wants to or not .
oh , yeah , this woman
just made my nonsexual to @-@ do list .
you have a sexual to @-@ do list ?
cece , don &apos;t ask .
number one ...
i regret it already .
joan allen .
oh ! nick !
she &apos;s back in the kitchen ! she &apos;s back in the kitchen !
nick , we &apos;re making sex .
it hasn &apos;t started yet .
it &apos;s not sex until you put the straw in the coconut .
it &apos;s called foreplay , you tween .
you don &apos;t just buy a porsche off the lot and
immediately enter it in the groser preis von deutschland .
what ?
the groser preis von deutschland .
just let me eat in here . i don &apos;t want to eat around reagan .
why not ?
oh , i forgot that you &apos;re a bear in pants .
will you please go eat in your room ?
she &apos;s right across the hall . she &apos;ll hear the crunching !
we need you elsewhere , nick .
from my cold , dead hands !
that doesn &apos;t even apply .
reagan !
ooh , what a coincidence . we &apos;re both running !
and i &apos;ve been chasing you for miles like a murderer !
i kind of prefer to run alone .
you see ?
that &apos;s your problem right there .
we &apos;re roommates now , and in our loft ,
we do things together , like a family .
ooh , look . a bubbler .
oh , that &apos;s so good !
there &apos;s a band @-@ aid in there .
reagan ?
camilla . oh , my god . hi .
why did i think you were still in atlanta ?
oh , because last night you sent me a text
saying , &quot; still in atlanta . &quot;
well , hello . what have we here ?
back on the stick , i see .
no , no , no .
no . no . i &apos;m just staying with him and his roommates .
yeah , which is exactly why you got to start
hanging out with us more .
you know , we only got you for a month .
i get you for a whole month ?
i &apos;m about to start binge @-@ watching ken burns &apos;s jazz .
oh , ken burns &apos;s jazz .
call you later . i will .
do that .
call me , yes .
okay , great . i &apos;m going to .
great .
can &apos;t wait .
what is wrong with you ? what is wrong with you ?
i am hooking up with her . i &apos;m dating her a little bit ,
but i &apos;m over it , and i &apos;m trying to avoid her .
what are you telling people i &apos;m here for a month for ?
oh , you see what we &apos;re doing right now ?
we &apos;re vibing , we &apos;re talking about stuff !
okay , now it &apos;s my turn . let me do you .
um ... i think i swallowed a band @-@ aid earlier .
now i have to dump her , and i have never
dumped anybody before . i don &apos;t know how .
i travel so much that i usually just disappear .
okay . i will help you break up with her .
why ? &apos; cause you &apos;ve been dumped , like , a million times ?
no . because i &apos;m your roommate , and we have each other &apos;s backs .
wait a minute . what makes you think
i &apos;ve been dumped a lot ?
please . i read you guys the moment i got there .
nick &apos;s deal is , he honest @-@ to @-@ god might be 50 .
schmidt &apos;s deal is he had to shazam &quot; stairway to heaven . &quot;
and your deal is you &apos;ve been dumped a lot .
you &apos;re pretty good . you &apos;re pretty good .
how did nick go through so many napkins ,
yet get salsa everywhere ?
we &apos;ve got no privacy , and it has been way , way , way too long
since mama got her biscuits .
and the biscuits ... are rising .
i hope they stick to the pan
and get a little brown on the bottom .
i &apos;m gonna be honest .
that went right over my head . i just didn &apos;t get it .
i don &apos;t know ... i don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going with it .
plus , i can &apos;t concentrate . it &apos;s filthy in here .
how do we keep nick out of here ? ! he thinks that
reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess .
okay , well , the truth of the matter is , is i kind of get it .
you know , when we first met , i had to pretend that all kinds
of things were wrong with you just so i wouldn &apos;t freak out .
you know , like , i gave you a glass eye for a while .
you had a wooden foot for a short period of time .
there was one week where i pretended
that you were a democrat .
i am a democrat .
ah , that &apos;s so funny . i love you .
okay . so we tell nick she has a glass eye .
he &apos;ll spin out .
he &apos;ll think the eye is a government @-@ issued camera
taking pictures for langley .
nick &apos;s a conspiracy theorist .
it &apos;s like an irish carnival up there--
just potato peels , broken rides , fiddle music ,
dreams left unfulfilled , bloodied soccer jerseys ,
bunch of women limping around named moira .
okay . so all we have to do is find a detail
that won &apos;t make him spin out . easy .
it &apos;ll be the opposite of easy .
it will be difficult .
we need to come up with something so smart , so nuanced ,
so ... unexpected , so surgical ,
that only a genius could think of it .
reagan wears a wig .
what ? get out of here .
no , it &apos;s true .
she @-@ she told me .
oh , she told you ?
yeah .
when ?
before .
well , the timing definitely checks out .
the only question is why .
personal , um , lady reasons .
i don &apos;t want to touch that .
&quot; reagan wears a wig . &quot;
&quot; told you before . &quot;
yep .
&quot; because of lady stuff . &quot;
i don &apos;t buy it .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
we failed .
patience . i know my boy .
but , schmidt ...
i know my boy !
hey , nick .
got to get busy living or get busy dying . heard .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing is the question . what are you doing ?
were you just smelling my hair ?
no . i &apos;m just nicky being nicky .
sometimes i feel like you &apos;re in one of those
weird man @-@ dog body @-@ switch movies .
you like those , too ? neither ?
it &apos;s a wig .
doesn &apos;t make sense !
what ?
ding , ding .
the biscuits are ready .
well , did you make enough for cousin andy ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m gonna tell you the truth .
i don &apos;t get that one , either . who the hell is cousin andy ?
i just made it up .
reagan , i have broken up with
so many times in so many different places .
um , multiple parks , coffee shops , uh , santa &apos;s lap ,
kitchen stadium on iron chef ,
airplanes in economy ,
economy select , economy comfort , platinum economy ,
all covered in butterflies ...
i feel like we have established your credentials .
okay . so i &apos;m camilla . break up with me .
camilla ...
yes , baby . i love you so much .
we have had a lot of really good times together ,
and i just ...
oh , my god .
oh , my god , oh , my goodness , oh , my god !
i knew this was comin &apos; . oh , my god ,
oh , my goodness .
what @-@ what are you doing ?
oh , no . are you breaking up with me ?
why you hate me ? why you hate me so much ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t hate you . i don &apos;t hate you .
oh , my god ,
you don &apos;t ? oh , my goodness . so you &apos;re not breaking up with me .
we &apos;re gonna have such a happy life together .
i @-@ i ...
i am . i am breaking up with you .
oh , my god ,
you is breakin &apos; up with me .
why you is breakin &apos; up with me and stuff ?
yo , this is mad crazy . i &apos;m pregnant with your child .
that isn &apos;t possible .
yeah , his name is d &apos;lante .
we would never name our child that .
yeah . d @-@ apostrophe @-@ lante .
no , i can &apos;t ... look , i can &apos;t do this .
look , i want you to be happy . here .
here &apos;s $ 80 .
wow . really ? you &apos;re just gonna bail ?
yeah . i suck at this , obviously .
i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
honey , sit down , sit down , sit down .
here .
why don &apos;t you just be honest
about why you &apos;re breaking up with her ?
i don &apos;t ... know .
i just feel like it &apos;s over .
let me tell you
about some reasons why i &apos;ve been broken up with .
um , &quot; you &apos;re too nasty in bed , winston . &quot;
or &quot; you remind me of my brother , winston . &quot; or ...
or &quot; winston , you spend too much time in the butterfly house . &quot;
i have an idea .
what if you break up with camilla for me ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
because obviously you understand how it feels ,
and you &apos;ll be much more gentle and empathetic .
what ? no , that is the exact opposite
of what we &apos;re trying to accomplish here .
this is a very important moment in your life .
you see , you have the ability to change ,
and that is what i find
the most beautiful about human beings .
if you do it , i will do a 20 @-@ minute roommate dinner .
okay , deal .
i been thinking ...
damn it , miller !
maybe winston was right .
how well do we know this reagan character ?
i mean , sure , she wears a wig .
not a big deal . or , let me ask you ,
is it a big deal ?
ask yourself ,
what type of person wears a wig ?
a bald person ?
sure . i &apos;ll say so .
they &apos;re bald . somebody hiding something ?
definitely .
maybe she &apos;s not hiding anything , all right ?
beyoncé , beyoncé wears wigs ,
and you would trust beyoncé with your life .
yeah , i &apos;d trust beyoncé with my life .
ride it with my surfboard
surfboard , surfboard
bringin &apos; on that wood , oh , baby , bringin &apos; on that wood !
we be all night .
we be all night .
nick , is it possible that you are maybe
overthinking this just a little bit , okay ?
&apos;cause , look , reagan is a really good roommate .
she &apos;s quiet , she pays , she takes care of her room .
her room . that &apos;s it .
great thinking .
that &apos;s why i love you .
that &apos;s why .
not physically .
uh , but as a person .
like , um , it &apos;s not sexual . i love you like a mother
or a sister or a girlfriend . it &apos;s not sexual .
her room !
come on , come on , come on , come on . oh !
jackpot .
ribbons ! oh , these are probably jess &apos;s .
nick , stop . you should not be in here .
i am learning so much about you , reagan .
an ohio state t @-@ shirt .
cash from canada . it &apos;s canadian cash .
a picture of a little boy .
this woman is like an orange .
you peel a layer , there &apos;s another layer there .
you &apos;re thinking of an onion . an orange only has one layer .
oh , you poor thing .
okay , someone has to put everything back
exactly like they found it .
well , it clearly is gonna be me ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m the only one who can fold .
nick , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making a mess , but i &apos;m finding the truth .
okay , i &apos;m gonna end this . nick , reagan doesn &apos;t wear a wig .
we made the whole thing up .
but i smelled it and i saw it .
we couldn &apos;t get you out of our room .
why would you lie to me ?
well , we wouldn &apos;t need to lie to you if you would just talk
to reagan instead of hiding out in my room
with your cheap southwestern food .
talk to her ? like a normal human being ?
yes ,
that &apos;s exactly what i want you to do .
yes . mm @-@ hmm .
i have nothing in common with that woman .
she is a goddess who &apos;s descended from the heavens .
and i &apos;m just a mud man from the bowels of chicago .
let &apos;s clean this place up , and let &apos;s get out of here .
she &apos;s gonna be home soon .
wait .
what are these ?
&quot; sarah nevada &quot; ? &quot; suzi shimizu &quot; ?
that &apos;s reagan &apos;s face .
these are fake i.d. &apos; s .
fake i.d. &apos; s ?
it &apos;s f ... it &apos;s fake identification .
you &apos;re damn right it is , jack .
look , this is a little bit weird , but i &apos;m sure there &apos;s
a perfectly reasonable explanation for this .
maybe nick is onto something here , okay ?
because how much do we actually really know about her ?
who has fake i.d. &apos; s ?
i &apos;ll tell you who .
con men . grifters .
it &apos;s all starting to make sense to me .
check this out . let me break this down for you .
okay ? she and her bastard son ...
or her nephew .
... who she had
with the ohio state professor ,
go town to town , selling ...
let &apos;s say fake pills .
pills . doctor . pharmacy . whatever she does .
to a bunch of maple @-@ sucking tree huggers .
aka those lovely stoners from the north ,
our canadian brothers and sisters .
let &apos;s just clean this place up , and let &apos;s get out of here .
guys ! winston made me bring home dinner .
it &apos;s reagan . or is it suzi ?
oh , jewish god , why do you hate me ? clean up the floor !
okay , yeah .
she is the one who has to explain herself .
let her come in here .
you have gone full nick , cece .
what does that mean ?
she &apos;s bought into your nonsense !
enough . i &apos;m very disappointed with you .
put this down .
i just picked it up !
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll fold it . you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
hey , reagan , come in here !
no , no , reagan !
don &apos;t come in here !
there &apos;s a possum in here !
don &apos;t come in here , &apos; cause there &apos;s ...
what do you mean reagan wants to break up with me ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m her roommate .
oh , so she sent her roommate to break up with me ?
now i have no more questions .
great . then i &apos;m out . blessings .
okay , look , um ,
i know this is not ideal .
but if i &apos;m being honest ,
she &apos;s got a lot of work to do emotionally .
are you really gonna let her get away with this ?
you must know how this makes me feel .
you &apos;ve clearly been dumped many times .
why do people keep saying that ?
you ordered a shirley temple .
it &apos;s a virgin denzel .
if she wants to dump me ,
she should man up and look me in the eye .
you know what , she should have ,
and i told her that .
it &apos;s the least she could have done .
hey , you &apos;re preaching to the choir .
ask me how many times i &apos;ve been dumped .
i don &apos;t have the ...
47 times . and once on my birthday .
and out of that 47 times and once on my birthday ,
do you know what part hurts the most ?
getting bailed on .
getting bailed on .
why do people think they can just disappear on you ?
they &apos;re not thinking at all . except of themselves .
let &apos;s go find her .
hell yeah . ooh , wait , wait , wait , i just thought about it ,
and that &apos;s not a good idea .
where is she ?
how you ... how you know i know where she at ?
you said you &apos;re roommates .
damn .
bitten by my own snake .
so you all went through my room and you each have things
that you would like to discuss . is that correct ?
that &apos;s true .
yes .
chicago .
so-- the money , the fake i.d. &apos; s .
i have fake i.d. &apos; s because hospitals hate
pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door .
i carry canadian cash because i do a lot of business there
and i don &apos;t trust banks .
who does ?
okay . all right , fine .
what about this , though-- your son ?
he looks just like you .
that is me .
wait . what ?
oof . rough haircut .
oh , and if you found something in my room
that kind of looks like a hollowed @-@ out hand ,
that &apos;s a glove .
so i went full nick , huh ?
yes , you went full nick .
right , yeah , i see that now .
i &apos;m full nick every day . imagine how that feels .
we all owe you an apology for ... pretty much everything .
i &apos;m sorry that we went through your room .
well , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m upset about . i mean ,
i went through all of your rooms when i first moved in .
excuse me ?
wait , you went through our rooms ?
oh , no .
how else am i supposed to get to know you ?
but the point is i didn &apos;t jump to conclusions .
i mean , nick has a two @-@ by @-@ four in his room with a nail in it .
i didn &apos;t assume he was building a human cage .
i &apos;m building a tree house .
you &apos;re doing wha ... you &apos;re building a tree house ?
well , why am i not involved ? why is cece not involved ?
we want to be involved .
oh , i &apos;m involved .
so &apos;s winston .
what ?
everyone &apos;s involved in the tree house but i ?
forget about it . reagan , how would you like
to build a tree house with me ?
no .
reagan , we already got plans ,
we already got a two @-@ by @-@ four .
no . i feel like we are really off @-@ topic here .
what i &apos;m trying to say is :
why did you just assume that i &apos;m a criminal ?
well , because these two are paranoid maniacs .
who apparently are building a tree house together .
not apparently . we are .
on the other hand ,
we hardly know anything about you .
oh , my god . okay , that &apos;s what this is about ?
look , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m only gonna be here for a few weeks .
there is no reason to get all emotionally involved .
let &apos;s just keep it clean , and that way nobody gets upset .
i am so upset right now .
uh , let me get ahead of this , roomie .
i did not help out today .
camilla .
hi , baby , hi .
what are you doing here ?
cut the crap .
why ?
you sent him to dump me ?
no . to dump you ?
no . why would i do that ... why would you do that ?
what the hell , man ?
that is crazy .
why would anyone do that ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
tell the truth , you sneaky woman .
reagan , are you dumping me or not ?
no .
kind of .
look , camilla , i , uh ...
i don &apos;t want to ... i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
just say it .
okay .
the truth is ...
that i &apos;m a criminal .
what ?
i &apos;m a criminal .
you shouldn &apos;t be with me . i &apos;m disgusting .
things i &apos;ve done .
things i &apos;m capable of .
hard life , short life-- i probably won &apos;t live that long .
i can &apos;t believe this .
she &apos;s a criminal .
filthy .
disgusting crimes .
one of the worst human beings
i &apos;ve ever met in my life .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m her , uh , co @-@ criminal .
co @-@ gangster . we run the streets together .
from bangkok to chicago to here .
just murdering people .
my name is nick . on the streets , they call me , uh ...
sharky .
sharky , that &apos;s right .
&apos;cause i attack from beneath up .
it &apos;s all true , camilla .
and her name is not reagan .
it &apos;s suzi shimizu .
you &apos;re japanese ?
very much so .
we happen ... we happen to all be japanese .
the unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky american gis .
unnecessary backstory .
yeah , they call me
the moyel on the streets ,
&apos;cause i will , uh ...
... cut your penis off .
isn &apos;t that right , sharky ?
you &apos;re on your own , moyel .
and they call me cece ,
but spelled s @-@ i @-@ s @-@ i ,
with an accent over the last i.
i am spinning out here , moyel . you got to help me .
why don &apos;t you go spin all the way over to your tree house ?
schmidt knows about the tree house ?
okay , what the hell is going on ?
winston , check for a wire--
she could be a rat .
stop it . this isn &apos;t real .
you &apos;re telling us we &apos;re not a japanese crime family ?
reagan , tell me the truth .
reagan , seriously ,
just stop bailing .
i &apos;ll just go .
camilla , wait .
look ...
this isn &apos;t working out .
but i think that it &apos;s my fault .
because i don &apos;t let people in .
i &apos;m sorry .
i think that you deserve a lot better than that .
thank you .
i know that wasn &apos;t easy for you .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna take off .
do you , um , still have my blue sweater ?
yes .
oh , no , no , no ...
uh , it &apos;s right in my room .
right here , in the first door .
right there .
okay , thanks .
oh , no , no .
that &apos;s nice .
telling the truth works .
yeah , it did .
good job .
wait , wait , wait , wait for it .
freaking bitch !
i hate you ! i hate you so much !
yeah , it &apos;s the old &quot; i left my sweater &quot; trick .
let me tell you something , folks ,
i &apos;ve played that song before .
all right , well , this obviously turned out to be
a huge disaster .
i hate you so much !
but ... thank you .
try sleeping on an upside down bed !
i &apos;m proud of you .
all of you-- i mean , you guys
could &apos;ve bailed on me , but you didn &apos;t .
you stuck around , and you helped me
lie to a psychotic woman
who is now destroying all of my stuff .
anything to help .
it &apos;s kind of what we do .
it &apos;s how we roll .
how do you think she &apos;s taking it ?
what &apos;s with all these ribbons ? !
how long do you think she &apos;s gonna be in there ?
i like to do about 15 .
you are never gonna forget me !
you are never gonna forget camilla !
so , what &apos;d you bring us for dinner ?
how about this one ?
are you ready to ...
soak mama &apos;s beans ?
it &apos;s working , right ?
okay , shh . i love you .
yeah , i love you , too .
i love you . let &apos;s not talk .
okay .
nick !
what ?
you still can &apos;t eat in front of reagan ?
this has nothing to do with reagan .
i ... i &apos;ve just gotten used to eating in here . it &apos;s cozy .
why , what are you guys up to ?
what ?
can i come in ? my room is trashed .
this is where we eat , right ?
yes , please , please , please .
might as well .
i mean , sure , why not ?

thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
buenos noches !

i didn &apos;t get my huevos on you , did i ?
close your road .
