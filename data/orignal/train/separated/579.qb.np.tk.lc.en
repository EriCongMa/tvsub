if you were a dude , i &apos;d have my fist up your balls .
thank you , annie .

christina &quot; reach @-@ y , &quot;
i said kick .
annie , take it easy .
you gotta learn to trust people .
can &apos;t you leave me with a little something ?
we &apos;re friends , annie .
remember ?
we played dungeons &amp; dragons together .
that was a game .
this is paintball .
okay , a couple of announcements .
i want to thank pistol patty &apos;s cowboy creamery
for sponsoring our end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year picnic .
now .
free ice cream and that one guy
having a heart attack
aren &apos;t the only surprises today .
we &apos;re gonna end this year with a quick game
of paintball assassin .
last year &apos;s big mistake was way too valuable a prize .
and i &apos;ve been assured--
that this year will be different .
so take it away , pistol patty !
howdy , folks .
there &apos;s only one rule .
last man standing gets the prize .
there &apos;s your guns .
and here &apos;s the prize .
$ 100,000 cash .
go nuts !
i heard a rumor you never shoot an unarmed man .
whoever started that rumor didn &apos;t eat my beans .
then i guess it &apos;s lucky for me i &apos;m not unarmed .
seeing as i &apos;m ...
eating your beans .
jeff wants to see you .
yeah ? and i want pants .
a lot of people want a lot of things .
it won &apos;t hurt to hear him out , will it ?
we got a good hiding spot in the library .
as safe as you are here , you &apos;ll be safer with us .
math club &apos;s gotten a lot better since last year .
obviously , they were practicing
while the rest of us went on dates .
hold on . i have a plan .
math club !
yeah .
i &apos;m asian .
you guys asian ?
that &apos;s pretty racist , man .
that wasn &apos;t a no .
i &apos;m coming over !
don &apos;t shoot me , shoot him .
he &apos;s white , and he &apos;s out of ammo .
crap .
see you , abed .
shoot chang !
he defected to the math club .
math rules !
agh .
forget it .
just a waste of ammo .
let &apos;s go grab their paint .
yeah , i &apos;m much safer with you guys .
m &apos;lady .
what do you want , jeff ?
yikes . well , what do we all want ?
ammo .
how much you got left ?
$ 100,000 worth .
yeah , we &apos;re running low , too .
shut up , abed .
okay .
what have you heard about pierce ?
i hear he &apos;s still alive ,
holed up near the cafeteria .
well , i hear he has more paint than a french kindergarten .
are you proposing we join him ?
i &apos;m proposing his ammo joins us .
you haven &apos;t changed .
you think pierce has ?
annie , let &apos;s not rehash this .
the guy &apos;s been a jerk all year .
he &apos;s a jerk because we exclude him .
we exclude him because he &apos;s a jerk .
and the last time i checked , you were the last one
feeling sorry about it .
i guess i &apos;m still waiting for you guys to come around .
likewise .
okay , i &apos;m-- i am dead now .
i &apos;m dead .
who wears spurs in paintball ?
who the hell are you ?
the guy that &apos;s gonna win .
come on !
does that guy even go to this school ?
he &apos;s really good @-@ looking .
like , network tv good @-@ looking .
and did you see how big his guns were ?
why don &apos;t you just marry him , abed ?
i &apos;m just saying paintball is tough this year .
i agree .
careful , britta .
you can &apos;t hit all three of us .
she won &apos;t have to .
hey , troy .
abed !
i thought you were dead .
i thought you were dead .
guys .
oh , right .
by the power invested in us as deputies ,
we now pronounce you arrested .
deputies ? what are you , deputies of the stairwell ?
fort hawthorne .
there &apos;s a bounty on your head , my friend .
pierce .
my forehead &apos;s not that big , right ?
mm .
it &apos;s not small .
so you guys just let pierce boss you around
in exchange for paint pellets ?
actually , jeff , he &apos;s been pretty decent
in this game so far .
he &apos;s created a safe zone
where people can rest , eat , and if necessary ,
pump their breast milk .
wow , that sounds very nice of him .
beats standing around with empty guns ,
waiting to get picked off by the black rider .
are you talking about the handsome blond cowboy
with the big guns ?
is that guy a student ?
who--who is he ?
we just call him the black rider .
okay , but he &apos;s not really riding anything .
look , i don &apos;t name people , annie .
i &apos;m a deputy .
i deputize .
you have to surrender your guns .
oh , and your drugs .
my study group .
how long has it been ?
five hours .
too long .
welcome to fort hawthorne .
how is this even possible ?
it began with a dream , annie .
a dream and an impulse to hide in the men &apos;s room .
i found that people were willing to roll bullets
under the door ,
just for the right to take a dump .
by the way , for you guys ,
taking a dump &apos;s on the house .
or if you prefer , relax and catch a show .
this is insane .
don &apos;t worry , jeff .
i &apos;ve also got someone more your speed .
because you &apos;re gay .
all right , i think i &apos;ve seen enough ,
and i &apos;d like my gun back now .
only hawthorne personnel can
carry weapons inside , jeffrey .
all right , you got us here unarmed ,
at your mercy .
what do you want ?
we &apos;ll discuss over dinner .
you &apos;re famished .
tonight , we feast .
ah , the twinkies are wonderful tonight .
give us some space , miguel .
what if i told you guys i know where to find
enough ammo to end this cowardly hiding out
and split the prize seven ways ?
so send your goons to get it .
ah , they &apos;d never bring it back .
we trust each other . we &apos;re a study group .
that &apos;s pretty warm and fuzzy talk
coming from you , pierce .
mm @-@ hmm , you &apos;ve kind of acted like a villain this year .
i have ?
well--
a little bit .
you guys .
pierce is reaching out .
i &apos;m not risking my butt hauling ammo back
for the guy that has vicky dancing for twinkies .
she &apos;s a dance major , jeff .
and she loves twinkies .
and if you ever took the time to get to know her--
look .
uh , summer starts tomorrow .
for you guys , it means pool parties ,
dinners , one @-@ night stands .
for me ...
it means counting down the days &apos; til next fall .
before we go , let me do this for you .
let me bring us victory .
fine .
let &apos;s do it .
to the study group .
to the study group .
more juice , miguel .
i hope we find this cache of ammunition soon .
i need to pump .
me , too .
you talkin &apos; about peeing , right ?
no .
me , neither .
okay , about pierce .
i feel bad .
i shouldn &apos;t put so much effort into--
it &apos;s okay . i just think--
the study group is my family , you know ?
and if we start picking and choosing--
where do we stop ?
i get it .
you &apos;re a good kid .
and i wanna do my part to help you stay that way .
benjamin chang ,
for your betrayal of the cheerleaders &apos; alliance ,
i sentence you to pretendsies death .
guys ?
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i betrayed the math club for you .
ready ...
heather !
i &apos;m sorry i told trish about amber !
aim ...
fire .
holy crap .
not cool , bitch .
yeah , so you told me at last year &apos;s tryouts .
leave the guns .
whatev .
who &apos;s there ?
can i join you ?
no !
okay .
damn it , i &apos;m out . gimme your gun .
all right , be careful .
cheerleaders rule !
i &apos;ll take that .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the bad guy .
stop trying to fluster me with your handsomeness .
you &apos;re creepy .
then why is your chest getting all flushed ?
it &apos;s a rash .
i &apos;m allergic to beans .
look , do you even go to school here ?
sorry , i get paid to
shoot paintballs , honey .
not the breeze .
lame .
i &apos;ll hit you in the foot .
thank you .
you &apos;re dry , sugar .
i &apos;ll save you for last .
you won &apos;t get the chance .
you okay ?
i got a better look at him .
he &apos;s not that good @-@ looking .
didn &apos;t he shoot you ?
he tried .
he &apos;s a bad shot , too ?
man , what does this guy have going for him ?
pierce loaded your gun with blanks .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t--don &apos;t shoot !
why does this keep happening ?
and what kind of ice cream company does this ?
where &apos;s the paintball stuff from last year ?
i hid it
so the school doesn &apos;t get destroyed again .
too late .
oh , hi , jeff .
we just ran into the black rider .
dean , if you want this game to end ,
we need firepower .
in there .
the key &apos;s in my shorts .
i can get it out , i guess .
now , this is more like it .
okay , black rider .
now let &apos;s see who &apos;s attractive .
dude , you have a problem .
oh , nice .
whoa , where you going ?
to have a conversation with pierce .
she &apos;s pretty awesome today .
what happened ?
black rider .
he wiped out the whole fort .
then why are you still here ?
i can &apos;t go back out there .
this is the only life i know .
annie ?
is that you ?
d &apos;you get the ammo ?
yep .
annie ! what are you doing ?
why was jeff &apos;s gun loaded with blanks ?
was it ?
agh ! okay , okay , okay !
oh , coming out .
oh , okay .
i get it .
so once again , i &apos;m the bad guy .
yes .
well , he got to win last year .
it &apos;s a game , annie . it &apos;s j--
fine .
it &apos;s a game .
let &apos;s play .
put it in your holster .
come on , annie .
you &apos;re my favorite . i don &apos;t wanna beat you .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t want jeff to be--
put the gun in your holster ,
and let &apos;s play the game .
right .
so you can shoot me and play without me .
that &apos;s this group &apos;s favorite thing .
we &apos;re always nice to you , pierce .
wrong .
wrong !
three days ago , i walked in on you guys
playing cards without me .
three days ago !
we weren &apos;t playing cards .
we were voting , and you weren &apos;t invited
because we were voting about you .
what ?
we were taking a vote ...
on whether we &apos;d invite you back to the group next year .
lucky for you , it had to be unanimous .
there was one holdout .
one red card .
pick it up .
black rider ...
it &apos;s jeff winger .
i know you &apos;ve heard of me by now .
no .
he &apos;s lying .
look , if you &apos;re half the cool cowboy
you pretend to be ,
you &apos;ll respect that we &apos;ve got
a situation playing out here
and let us be until it &apos;s settled .
sure thing .
and once it &apos;s settled ...
i &apos;m taking out everybody in this room .
starting with you , mr. insecure .
you think you &apos;re good @-@ looking , but you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re average .
you &apos;re just an average @-@ looking guy
with a big chin .
what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s faking it .
no , something &apos;s wrong with him .
no , no , it &apos;s fake .
last week he did it
to get out of letting me have a stick of gum .
he &apos;s old , though . could be real .
it &apos;s real . it is .
the gurgling &apos;s a nice touch .
you guys are terrible people .
ah , we warned you .
buddy , are you all right ?
you want me to call 911 ?
sucker !
wait , seriously ?
told you , dude .
i &apos;m the best !
you &apos;re the worst .
i &apos;m out of the group ?
you &apos;re out of mine !
and i &apos;m winning !
we &apos;ve created a monster .
let &apos;s not give ourselves too much credit .
i &apos;m out .
some old guy pretended to have a heart attack .
shot me in the gut .
i don &apos;t care . that &apos;s your problem .
this school sucks .
well , then why do you go here ?
i wouldn &apos;t go to this toilet
with my big sister &apos;s toe .
i take a class online .
i was paid to be here and win the game
so my boss could keep his prize money .
you work for the ice cream company ?
sweetie , this thing is so much bigger
than you can even imagine .
i &apos;m outta here .
i got coldplay tickets .
coldplay ?
too late , bean allergy .
you blew it .
hello ?
anybody ?
does anyone have an alliance i can join ?
i &apos;m really loyal .
am i out ?
on your knees .
no greendale student can be allowed
to win this game .
initiate plan b : operation total invasion .
there &apos;s some more community coming up right now .
think it as extra credit .
greendale students .
i understand you &apos;ve unified
and intend to draw this game out .
well , if it was a war you want , it &apos;s a war you shall lose .
resistance is as pointless as your degrees .
are we the little rascals ?
i was .
i &apos;m on your team . stop shooting me .
we &apos;re gonna lose the war and this school .
looks like this is it .
we &apos;re dying out here .
i had a dream it would end this way .
once i &apos;m gone , i &apos;m gone .
then i guess i &apos;ll see you in hell .
