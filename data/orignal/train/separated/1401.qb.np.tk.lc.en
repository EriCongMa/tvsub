let &apos;s go , buddy . schooltime .
oh , and gloria , if you want to get together with the girls later ,
i could just , you know , watch the football game or something .
that means he wants to watch a football game .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
what are you drinking coffee for anyway ?
it &apos;s my culture . i &apos;m colombian .
oh , yeah ? what part of colombia
are those french toaster sticks from ?
babe , i &apos;m not sure about the game .
the whole family &apos;s coming over for the barbecue .
that &apos;s today ?
see .
it &apos;s the ohio state game .
so ? everybody can watch .
i don &apos;t like watching the game with people who don &apos;t know the game .
people talk .
you talk at my football games .
for one thing , it &apos;s called soccer .
your team scored two goals all season .
i &apos;m not taking a big risk .
how much of this did you drink ?
give me a break . i have to climb a rope today .
hey , mom .
yeah ?
can i have $ 40 for lunch ?
forty dollars ?
i also need a book for school .
what book ?
i want a dress .
do you have any idea what a bad liar you are ?
i &apos;d be more worried that
she couldn &apos;t come up with a single book title .
luke , come on . we &apos;re late .
mmm , there &apos;s a first- inside out and backwards .
at least it isn &apos;t zipped into his ...
oh . there it is .
well , there &apos;s book smart , and then there &apos;s street smart .
yeah , and then there &apos;s luke .
oh , he &apos;s just ... he &apos;s just curious . that &apos;s all .
he &apos;s got this almost scientific mind ...
with a thirst for knowledge .
he &apos;s like this little einstein .
some people ask , &quot; why ? &quot;
luke asks , &quot; why not ? &quot;
i ask &quot; why ? &quot; a lot .
we &apos;re at the ten . we &apos;re at the five .
we &apos;re at the one . daddy , we &apos;re scoring a touchdown !
no , please ... please don &apos;t spike our baby .
why is she dressed like the hamburglar ?
she &apos;s a referee .
do ... do we even have to go to my dad &apos;s tonight ?
are you kidding me ? we &apos;re playing ohio state .
i collect antique fountain pens .
i &apos;m quite adept at japanese flower arrangement-
ikebana-
and i was a starting offensive lineman at the university of illinois .
surprise .
i don &apos;t like football .
you know what ?
i thought part of being in a relationship ...
was pretending to enjoy your partner &apos;s interests .
do you think i really loved home pickle @-@ making ?
yeah , &apos; cause you did .
for a week ,
until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles .
oh , thank you , marvin , for inviting us into your lovely home .
here . would you care for a sack of pickles ?
it was charming .
we were picklers , mitchell .
okay , you know what ? fine .
stay home with your little jagged scissors .
maybe catch up on your scrapbooking .
come ... you loved scrapbooking .
did i , mitchell ? did i ?
stop . don &apos;t do the &quot; double question to prove a point &quot; thing .
i hate it when people do that .
do you , mitchell ? do you ?
stop , lily .
第一季第五集
no problem . we &apos;ll be right down . thanks .
hey , honey . what &apos;s up ?
the school just called . luke got in a fight .
oh , geez . is he okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s fine , but they want us to come down there .
where are you ?
i &apos;m showing a house .
what house ?
i &apos;m golfing .
i bet it was that durkas kid .
i hate that kid .
he probably jumped on luke
and luke just fought back .
kid &apos;s a menace .
he made fun of my hair once .
shh . the parents are probably in there .
i slept on it funny .
like that never happened to him ?
come on .
what are you doing here ?
these two knuckleheads were fighting each other .
what ?
could &apos;ve been worse .
i was not ready to face durkas today .
so what happened ?
well , apparently there was some name @-@ calling
and shoving on the playground .
by the time a teacher separated them ,
luke was sitting on manny &apos;s chest .
luke , that &apos;s not like you .
wait a minute .
you &apos;re luke &apos;s father ?
grandfather .
so manny &apos;s father is ...
javier .
crazy guy . that &apos;s where he gets his fire .
okay , you &apos;re ...
he &apos;s our son .
and my grandson .
i &apos;m his daughter .
so you &apos;re ...
his uncle .
stop saying that or i &apos;ll sit on your chest again .
ho ! wait a second . is that what this was all about ?
he keeps calling me his nephew .
you are my nephew .
shut up !
okay , okay .
i &apos;m getting the sense that you &apos;re all related , uh , somehow .
so it &apos;s probably best if you work this out at home ...
so the boys can go back to class , okay ?
but we &apos;re not happy about this , boys .
this is not how mature young men behave .
here &apos;s your note for miss passwater .
look , i wouldn &apos;t worry . they &apos;re good kids .
it &apos;s just tough when one kid &apos;s a little different .
yes .
yes .
you heard how she said that , right ?
&quot; yes . &quot;
she thought luke was the weird one . luke .
her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture ,
and manny is the different one .
i will tell you what &apos;s weird .
our son is not weird .
what &apos;s weird is that her kid wears aftershave
and dresses like a count .
i think we should cancel with them for the barbecue .
if we cancel , it &apos;ll just make this a bigger deal than it is .
it &apos;ll be good for luke and manny to spend some time .
might be good for you and gloria too .
why ?
she &apos;s always had a problem with me .
i think i &apos;m gonna find out what it is .
that &apos;s the worst thing you could do .
just sweep it under the rug .
i &apos;m not a sweeper .
trust me on this .
i think you two need to talk it out .
i don &apos;t have anything to say to her .
she &apos;s the one with the problem , not me .
whose side are you on ?
she &apos;s my daughter . you &apos;re my wife .
let &apos;s remember what &apos;s important here .
there &apos;s a football game on .
i just hate it when my two girls aren &apos;t getting along .
how exactly is she your girl ?
i got a few things for the party .
is lily ready to go ?
oh , yeah , yeah . she &apos;s ready .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m just really worried about c.j. hightower .
with the bad ankle ,
i don &apos;t know how he &apos;s gonna run his corner routes .
what did my boyfriend just say ?
listen , i heard what you said , and i thought , yes ,
i should try to learn more about football .
that is very mature of you .
i figure , if football fans can learn it ,
how hard can it be ?
that &apos;s very elitist of you .
i &apos;m taking baby steps here , all right ?
i &apos;m actually- i &apos;m really looking forward to it .
&apos;cause it &apos;s not just the game .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the bands and the drama , the pageantry .
don &apos;t forget about the team mascots .
they wear ascots ?
no . mascots . with an &quot; m. &quot;
that could have been very embarrassing .
okay .
am i straight ?
i &apos;m not sure what you are right now .
how ya doin &apos; ?
hey , gramps .
hi , beautiful .
hi , phil . good to see ya .
let me guess . game &apos;s on ?
just started .
hey . for you .
it &apos;s nice to see you , gloria .
ah ! two times today .
okay , well ...
uh , phil ?
she means we &apos;ve seen them two times today .
okay , everybody , the food &apos;s in there . the drinks are in there .
i &apos;ll be in here .
hold on , jay .
i think we should address the elephant in the room .
uh , luke , manny . bring it in .
come on . huddle up .
football .
now in light of what happened at school today ,
do you have any feelings you &apos;d like to express ?
i think this is the proper forum ...
for god &apos;s sakes . all right , both of you .
now , in this family , do we kick and punch each other ,
or do we love each other ?
love each other . that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ii be in the den .
so , i brought dessert .
okay . thank you .
i make pie too .
you can never have too many pies , right ?
okay , whoa . whoa .
everybody take a deep breath .
let &apos;s think about getting real .
phil , no .
why &quot; phil , no &quot; ?
what is phil doing ?
i &apos;m just gonna say it .
there &apos;s tension between you two .
bam . it &apos;s out there .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
i think he &apos;s right , and i think we should talk about it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about ...
you two talking ... about it .
i like football .
haley hates it , which is weird
because it &apos;s all boys ... and there &apos;s no reading required .
do you know that she spends
at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair ?
and then sometimes ...
let &apos;s go , illini !
let &apos;s go ! right now !
looks like i gotta watch the game with dick butkus .
米奇以为是讽刺同性恋的做爱方式 &#93;
dad ! dad , come on . that &apos;s offensive .
mitchell , he &apos;s one of the greatest linebackers
to ever play at illinois ...
and one of my personal heroes .
and his name is &quot; butt @-@ kiss &quot; ?
we &apos;re just choosing to ...
okay . all right .
dad , i thought you were being homophobic . i &apos;m sorry .
we got all night .
yes , we do .
are you joining us here ?
yeah .
jay , you know what ? he &apos;s been studying up .
i gotta tell ya , i &apos;m a little worried about c.j. hightower .
right ? with the bad ankle ?
i &apos;m wondering how he &apos;s gonna run his corner routes .
hightower &apos;s out .
what ?
oh . then who is gonna run the corner routes ?
i &apos;ll tell you who it won &apos;t be- billings .
that &apos;s low . he &apos;s in jail .
oh , wow . yeah . then no .
double tight end ,
it &apos;s gonna be a quarterback roll @-@ out to the left .
they &apos;re gonna run it .
no , trust me .
he &apos;s got the slot .
in the end zone ! touchdown !
lucky call . maybe they , uh , should &apos;ve considered blitzing .
blitzing wouldn &apos;t have helped them . get outta here .
oh , gosh . blitzing .
so , my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically ...
as the climax of west side story .
i &apos;m a musical theater fan .
surprise .
okay . the truth ?
i sometimes feel like you don &apos;t like me .
powerful , powerful stuff .
claire ? tell us how that makes you feel .
right now , i &apos;m feeling a lot of anger .
no , don &apos;t tell me . tell her .
gloria , right now , i &apos;m really angry at phil .
let &apos;s respect the process .
gloria , i don &apos;t know
why you think i don &apos;t like you .
sometimes when you see me , you make that face .
what face ?
like this .
i do not make a face like that .
oh , my god .
that is so claire .
mitchell !
see ? she does that with everyone .
it &apos;s just her face .
no , it &apos;s not just the face .
from the beginning ,
i feel like manny and i are not welcome in this family .
that is so crazy .
no , it &apos;s not so crazy . it &apos;s how i feel .
i am sorry if you feel that way .
i really am , because from the moment i met you ,
i have tried to make you feel comfortable with us .
you think it &apos;s all in my head ?
no . kind- i don &apos;t know .
i mean , we really love having you and manny in our family .
really ?
really .
so , you don &apos;t have to be so defensive .
i do that , don &apos;t i ?
well , a bit .
i &apos;m feeling a hug .
i was thinking group hug ,
but this is nice .
i &apos;d be there if i could .
oh , my god . there &apos;s hugging .
haley , get off the phone already .
where did you go ?
you heard him .
he said , &quot; get outta here . &quot;
oh , my god . you &apos;re such a girl .
dad- i was coming to get a beer anyways .
nice apology .
nice beer .
hey , there are the little roustabouts .
you look like you patched things up pretty good , huh ?
yeah .
oh , we can learn so much from the children .
bet it seems kind of silly now
what you were even fighting about , huh ?
i made fun of his accent .
what accent ?
i made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day .
i made fun of him because his mom used to dig coal .
what ?
he said you were a coal digger .
okay . i think we can move on .
who said i was a coal digger ?
that &apos;s what my mom told me .
what &apos;s a coal digger ?
sweetheart , he heard it wrong .
it &apos;s &quot; gold digger . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
i really do not think that i remember ever saying that .
well , you said in the car .
you said it at christmas .
you said it in the mexican restaurant-
okay ,
mr. &quot; leaves his sweatshirts at school every day ...
suddenly remembers everything , &quot; thank you .
and it was all in my head , huh ?
oh , listen . gloria , it was ...
like , a year ago , before i knew you .
nice going .
now my mom and my sister are fighting .
if i say something that everybody else is thinking ,
does that make me a mean person ?
or does it make me a brave person ?
one who is courageous enough to
stand up and @-@ and say something ...
behind someone &apos;s back
to a 10 @-@ year @-@ old .
well , she &apos;s pissed .
yeah . she wouldn &apos;t even come out of her room .
did you really have to call her that- a gold digger ?
well , you know what , dad ? it was a year ago .
and it was a natural question to ask .
she &apos;s a beautiful , hot woman ,
and you &apos;re not exactly , you know-
not exactly what ?
um- mitchell , little help ?
no . you are doing great .
see , this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug-
so people don &apos;t get hurt .
yeah , until you sweep too much under the rug .
then you got a lumpy rug .
creates a tripping hazard . you open yourself up to lawsuits .
boy , you can go a really long time without blinking .
gloria ? it &apos;s phil .
can i talk to you for a second ?
claire likes to say you can be part of the problem ...
or part of the solution .
but i happen to believe that you can be both .
listen , claire feels terrible .
why don &apos;t you talk to her ?
why ? i know what she thinks- a coal digger .
you know she &apos;s saying &quot; gold digger &quot; ?
yes , phil !
well , i @-@ i know she said that .
but that was a long time ago ,
before she knew you .
does jay buy me nice things ?
yes ! of course ! all beautiful things .
look at this- yellow , red , blue .
all the colors .
do you think i can &apos;t live without this ?
take them away , phil .
gloria ,
we all know you &apos;d be fine without underwear .
i mean , we know it &apos;s not about that .
no . it &apos;s about me not being accepted by my new family .
that is not true .
gloria , look , you &apos;re a beautiful woman .
in fact , you &apos;re probably one of those
beautiful women who doesn &apos;t even know it .
no , i know it .
so it &apos;s natural
for claire to wonder about you and her dad .
this family &apos;s very protective of each other .
i remember the first time claire brought me home .
do you think jay thought i was good enough for his little girl ?
no way . but over time ,
he realized that i loved claire as much as he did .
and by then , mitch had brought cam home ,
so i was golden .
claire just needs a little time .
and then , trust me ,
she &apos;ll be the most loyal friend you &apos;ve ever had .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
you know , there &apos;s kind of a lot of drama .
so we &apos;re torn .
let me ask you something .
your sister said that gloria
would never go for anybody who looked like me .
now , you guys basically are like women .
you know , you look at guys .
so what do you think ?
you &apos;re seriously asking us if you &apos;re attractive ?
well , i know i &apos;m no erik estrada or anything .
i &apos;m just curious is all .
dad .
so if i was in one of your bars and-
righteous brothers were on , you know .
would you , uh ,
i don &apos;t know , check me out ?
dad , you &apos;re really close to ruining gay for me .
all right , fine . whatever .
jay . jay , now listen .
i think it &apos;s- i just think it &apos;s
a little weird for a son to say this to his father .
but for the record , i think you &apos;re smokin &apos; hot .
really ?
yeah , 100 % . you &apos;re totally my type .
you &apos;re dangerous , you &apos;re getable ,
you have a little &quot; cashola &quot; in your pocket .
face , body , the whole-
the whole kit and caboodle , i think . really .
what about a seven ? nine . for sure , nine .
but you knew that .
i might have lowballed a little bit .
okay , isn &apos;t there a game on ?
touchy .
i know .
gloria ? come on , let &apos;s- let &apos;s talk about this .
i &apos;ve seen her kick in a door before .
i don &apos;t know what my husband is saying to you or ...
why he &apos;s covered in your underwear .
obviously i &apos;m trying to seduce him for his money .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what i do , right ?
what do i have to give back ...
so that everyone trusts me ? huh ?
these earrings ?
no .
what ? this bracelet ?
no .
my new dress ?
no .
i didn &apos;t respond because ...
this shouldn &apos;t be about me .
it should be about you ...
talking to you ... about it .
phil ? honey ?
no , no , no . no .
you &apos;re welcome .
i don &apos;t know what to say
except for that i am really , really sorry .
just tell me one thing .
how do you really feel that i &apos;m with your father ?
uh , well-
honestly , at first , it was hard .
i mean , you don &apos;t expect to wake up one morning ...
with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap .
but ... i &apos;m getting used to it .
and the important thing is you make him happy ,
which you do in- in so many ways ,
so many colors .
are we okay ?
no .
no ?
you embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs .
what , i &apos;m supposed just to forget about it ?
what do you want me to do-
just embarrass myself so we &apos;re even ?
go jump in the pool .
oh , you mean go jump in a lake . right .
go jump in the pool with your clothes on .
then i know you &apos;re sorry .
i &apos;m not gonna do that , gloria .
okay . then i won &apos;t forgive you .
now a field goal beats us .
hey , you guys work that out ?
almost . gloria just wants me to jump in the pool .
okay then .
what ?
if they could get a pass rush on &apos; em , something , a break .
this is so awesome .
i know . mom does not look good wet .
gloria , is this really necessary ?
dad , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . if i need to jump in this water ...
to prove to gloria how sorry i am , i will do it .
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re serious ? you &apos;re not gonna stop me ?
why would i do that ?
because i am standing here .
i am showing you my willingness to-
no ?
are you happy ?
yes ! i forgive you !
then give me your hand .
oh , that &apos;s the oldest trick in the book .
she &apos;s gonna pull you in there .
no !
and that &apos;s my job .
this is funny , but this is also a teaching moment .
yeah !
think about ... no !
cannonball !
the snap ! fumble !
how could he fumble that ?
center blew the snap .
you know what ? i hate that .
i played center ,
and i always got blamed for a quarterback &apos;s clumsy hands .
well , i was a quarterback , and it was probably your fault .
it &apos;s impossible to fumble the ball ...
when the quarterback has the proper hand placement .
it &apos;s weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to dad .
no , you wanna hear weird ?
cam said he &apos;d pick up dad at a gay bar .
ooh . how did that come up ?
mmm , i &apos;m really trying to block it out .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
mom and dad had sex two times .
agreed .
okay , get your hands up there
like you &apos;re lifting me off the ground .
be one with me , jay . there you go .
do you wanna get something to eat ?
i am never eating again .
just snap the damn thing .
perfect . that one kinda hurt .
