what do you want with me ?
seriously ?
you &apos;ve been hunting us for weeks .
on whose orders ?
michael noshimuri .
so , what , you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re just avenging his death , is that it ?
yes .
i know everyone who worked for my brother .
nice try .
this isn &apos;t about revenge .
the clan you represent has nothing to do with my family .
so why is there a price on my head ?
what did he say ?
i said ,
my friends are gonna have fun with you
before they cut you into little pieces .
you shut your mouth . and we &apos;re gonna make your boyfriend watch .
shut your mouth !
kill me and you &apos;ll never find out who wants you dead .
good point .
i got five more bullets .
now tell me who sanctioned the hit !
the oyabun .
who is he ? !
adam . adam !
this is not the way , okay ?
it &apos;s the only way .
kono , this guy knows the yakuza will kill him
if he talks to us .
he needs to know we &apos;ll do the same
if he doesn &apos;t answer our questions .
help me .
please , help me .
can you help me get out ?
can you help me ?
no !
no , no !
cheers , ladies .
to the future mrs. nathan cotchin .
to our good friend nate ,
who at the age of 25 has decided he &apos;s cool
with having sex with one woman for the rest of his life .
thanks for making us look bad to our girlfriends .
what &apos;s happened ?
i mean , do i miss something ?
the music just went all sad .
that &apos;s because that &apos;s how the filmmakers want you to feel .
sad . see ?
well , no , this is supposed to be a romantic comedy .
this is neither romantic nor funny .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
i got it .
okay , this is what they call the third act .
they @-@ they got to come up with some goofy obstacle
so that when they get back together at the end ,
so get to feel all , uh , warm and fuzzy .
yeah , you know ,
can you guys just save the running commentary
for the dvd release ?
yes .
okay .
sorry .
thank you .
now .
watch this .
are you ready ?
montage fades out and ...
sam , i thought you were never coming back .
well , you thought wrong .
i have an 11 @-@ year old daughter .
so i &apos;m very hip to this specific genre of cinema .
this is the most unrealistic movie
i &apos;ve ever seen in my life .
stop talking !
i &apos;m sorry , man .
oh , come on . turn off the phone .
are you serious ? are you serious ?
i &apos;m on duty , i &apos;m on duty .
mcgarrett .
i &apos;d ask you to tell me how the movie ends , but i already know .
uh @-@ huh . no , yeah . we &apos;re on the way .
no problem .
bye .
sorry .
finally ! these guys suck .
the c.o.d. was three close @-@ range gsws to the chest .
lacerations and defensive wounds on his hands
indicate that the victim ...
put up a good fight before he was shot dead .
yes , thank you for completing my exact thought ,
commander mcgarrett .
the guy &apos;s name is john fitzpatrick .
he &apos;s from saint petersburg , florida .
he checked in yesterday .
what &apos;s with the penguin suit ?
there was a big black tie wedding here tonight .
some wealthy family from new york
booked out half the resort .
i &apos;m thinking he was a guest .
weddings , i tell you , every time .
it &apos;s a bad idea .
you got dysfunctional family members . bunch of bitter friends .
and they &apos;re all fueled by an open bar .
something terrible is bound to happen .
and you wonder why you &apos;re divorced .
okay , you know i &apos;m right .
this guy and another guy ,
they get into a beef over , uh , i don &apos;t know ,
let &apos;s say a broad at the reception .
they end up back in the room here , uh ,
get into a little fisticuffs .
uh , this guy doesn &apos;t realize his buddy has a gun-- bang , here he is .
interesting .
very detailed theory .
i particularly enjoyed your use of the word &quot; fisticuffs &quot;
thank you .
but according to the gm ,
the bride bailed on the wedding mid @-@ ceremony .
reception never even happened .
ah , well , at least we &apos;re dealing with a smart woman .
all right , chin .
uh , call saint petersburg pd .
see if they can tell us anything about the victim .
you and i , let &apos;s go talk to the wedding party .
see if they know anything about fitzpatrick .
okay .
excuse me , mrs. cotchin ?
steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
this is detective danny williams , my partner .
hi .
thank you so much for coming .
allen ? police .
allen kingston , i &apos;m mrs. cotchin &apos;s attorney .
i @-@ i spoke with sergeant lukela .
he assured us the police would do
everything they could to help find dahlia .
yes , ma &apos;am , and i &apos;m sure that &apos;s the case ,
but we &apos;re not here about the , uh , the missing bride .
we &apos;re actually here about the murder of one john fitzpatrick .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , am i supposed to know who that is ?
he found him , uh , in a hotel room wearing a tuxedo
and he had your wedding program .
well , that may be ,
but he was not invited .
i oversaw the guest list myself .
okay , you &apos;re saying he was a wedding crasher ?
nathan cotchin is heir
to one of the largest real estate fortunes in new york .
ever since news of the engagement broke ,
the tabloids have been hounding him and dahlia .
they &apos;ve had paparazzi camped outside their building for weeks .
okay , well , the victim &apos;s room was searched .
uh , there was no camera equipment .
so it &apos;s highly unlikely that he was a paparazzi .
whoever he was , i am terribly sorry he lost his life .
but my future daughter @-@ in @-@ law is missing .
with all due respect , mrs. cotchin ,
my guess is that &apos;s no coincidence .
whoa @-@ whoa @-@ whoa . wait a minute .
are you implying that dahlia is a suspect ?
no . i mean , you know , for all we know , she could be a target .
we &apos;re just saying that her running
might not be a case of cold feet .
excuse me .
chin , what do you got ?
so i got this footage from the videographer .
and it looks like the wedding &apos;s going off without a hitch , right ?
until right here .
check out the expression on dahlia &apos;s face .
something scared her .
she &apos;s looking over that way . can you zoom in ?
well , it looks like everyone &apos;s smiling except this guy .
that &apos;s our victim .
fitzpatrick was at the ceremony .
he &apos;s the reason the bride took off .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
this guy crashed my wedding and now he &apos;s dead ?
who was he ?
john fitzpatrick , from florida .
dahlia never mentioned this guy ?
no . why ?
because he &apos;s the reason she ran .
i knew there had to be an explanation .
all day , she was so happy and confident .
all that changed when she saw this guy .
now , could he be an ex @-@ boyfriend of hers ,
somebody from her past ?
i know all her friends , and she has very little family .
we don &apos;t keep secrets .
well , respectfully , nathan ,
your fiance just ran out of her own wedding ceremony
to get away from this person .
so , i mean , whatever her connection is with him ,
she &apos;s been hiding it from you .
if this man is dead , then where is dahlia ?
so why did fitzpatrick crash this wedding ?
i don &apos;t know . my money &apos;s on him being a jealous ex .
weddings tend to bring them out in droves , you know ?
you ever talk to anybody about this ?
about what ?
about your issues with weddings , they &apos;re deep @-@ seated .
i &apos;m just saying that you should maybe workshop them .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m literally speaking from experience .
i got two cousins , two of my cousins had
their weddings busted up by jealous exes .
okay , so you think fitzpatrick
came to break up the wedding ,
and dahlia , what , lost her mind and then killed him ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , she is our only natural suspect ,
but tod does not match up .
the valet guy said that she beelined for her car .
yeah , not to mention she &apos;s a hundred pounds soaking wet .
there &apos;s no way she could inflict those defensive wounds
that we saw on that guy .
monkey , what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re good ?
yeah . gabby makes better pancakes than you .
really ? that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s what you called ,
to make that point to me now , ruin my day ?
seriously . it &apos;s not even close .
she needs to teach you how
to make &apos; em all gooey in the middle .
oh , okay .
well , then why don &apos;t you put the master chef on the phone ?
i &apos;ll get her recipe , huh ?
okay . love you , danno .
love you , too .
okay , i swear i did not put her up to that .
have i told you how fantastic you are ?
um , not in the last 12 hours .
hey , if you are gonna be late at work tonight ,
that &apos;s totally fine
because we have an entire mani @-@ pedi night planned .
you got a mani @-@ ped ... ? listen , do me a favor .
you are not allowed to top
my daddy @-@ daughter spa nights , please .
no , no , this is just gonna be mediocre ...
unlike my pancakes .
so i kind of hate to bring this up again ,
but they &apos;re really pressing me for an answer .
so ... have you given any more thought to what we discussed ?
uh , yes , of course i have , and i do want to talk about it ,
but steve and i just pulled up to a crime scene , so , um ...
okay , um , yeah , no problem .
we &apos;ll chat about it when when you get home .
okay .
okay .
we just pulled up to a crime scene ?
keep driving . we &apos;ll find one , okay ?
okay .
any news of our runaway bride ?
no , still mia .
airports are on alert
and i got units searching the island .
i did hear back from the saint petersburg pd
about our victim , though .
according to them , john fitzpatrick doesn &apos;t exist .
driver &apos;s license was a fake
along with the credit card he used to register at the hotel .
okay , so we got
a guy who flies to hawaii under an alias ,
crashes a wedding ,
and then ends up shot dead , is that right ?
pretty much .
i ran his prints through iafis and didn &apos;t get a hit .
but i did hear back on the murder weapon .
ballistics came back to a ruger .9mm recently used
in a string of armed robberies .
no arrests yet ,
but hpd is circling a suspect .
meet ty amano , 22 years old .
been in and out of juvie for drug possession .
looks like he graduated to armed robbery .
and now possibly murder .
side out , bitches !
ty !
time to sub out .
i already told you ,
i don &apos;t own a gun ,
and i definitely don &apos;t know nothing
about no dead guy at a wedding .
i was getting tacos up in waimanalo last night .
really ? i &apos;ll bet you got witnesses
to corroborate that alibi , too , huh ?
your dealer , a buyer maybe ?
or wait a minute .
maybe you &apos;re with the guys
you &apos;ve been pulling off the armed robberies with , huh ?
i ain &apos;t no robber .
okay . well , that &apos;s fine .
then you won &apos;t mind if hpd goes
and searches your apartment right now , yeah ?
just to make sure there &apos;s no stolen goods , right ?
all right , all right , man . okay , so here &apos;s the deal :
i might have some stuff back at my place ,
but i &apos;m just holding it for a friend .
oh , okay .
i swear i got nothing on this dead guy !
i got rid of that gun two days ago .
what , you dumped it ?
hell no .
the piece is worth 500 bucks .
old dawn patrol buddy asked me
to hook his boy up with some heat , so i did him a solid .
nice solid ,
unloading a hot gun , you idiot .
who &apos;d you sell it to ?
let me go check the sales receipt .
hey , you want to be a smart @-@ ass , huh ?
i don &apos;t freaking know !
buyer didn &apos;t give me a name .
haole , brown hair , medium height .
he look like this guy ?
yeah , that &apos;s him .
oh , man .
he &apos;s your dead dude ?
yeah , he was killed with the gun you sold him .
what else do you know about him ?
nothing . my buddy just said he was a friend .
someone he knew growing up in germany .
this guy was german ?
didn &apos;t talk german .
sounded pretty american to me .
turns out john fitzpatrick is actually brad dixon .
he &apos;s a u.s. citizen convicted
of running confidence scams all throughout the eu .
in fact , he was just released
from a munich prison six weeks ago .
the cotchins had deep pockets .
guess this guy was targeting them .
yeah , and it gets better .
according to the report ,
dixon &apos;s game was actually running sweetheart scams
against rich bachelors using female accomplices as bait .
okay , who was the accomplice ?
his sister , nicole dixon .
but you know her as ...
dahlia swain .
aka our runaway bride .
so german police arrested
brad and nicole dixon back in 2008 .
they were convicted on multiple counts of embezzlement and extortion .
now , brad served five years in prison ,
but nicole got out after six months .
well , she must have testified against him to get a reduced sentence .
so she rolls on her brother ,
she moves to new york , changes her name to dahlia swain ,
finds a new mark , the cotchin kid ,
and dupes him into marrying her .
meanwhile , brad gets out of prison ,
finds out that his kid sister is about to cash in ,
crashes the wedding
to make sure he gets his cut .
it &apos;s got to be about more than just money .
i mean , check it out .
how would you feel
if your sister rolled on you the way she did him ?
i &apos;d want to kill her . fair point .
so he gets a gun for revenge .
dahlia realizes that she can &apos;t buy his silence .
so that explains why she ran .
well , it &apos;s a good thing she ran , for the cotchins , anyway ,
because if this guy doesn &apos;t come and bust up that wedding ,
they are out a lot of money .
yeah , somehow , i don &apos;t think the groom is gonna see
that silver lining when we break the news to him .
well , this goes to show you why people should never ,
under any circumstances , get married .
why ? in case you marry a con artist
who &apos;s after all your money ?
no , steve .
because people are never who they say they are .
and even if they are , they end up changing .
relationships , they don &apos;t work . they don &apos;t last forever .
bottom line . that &apos;s it .
what has gotten into you today ?
uh , gabby , she was offered
a six @-@ month curatorship in denver , colorado .
oh ! oh , well , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
that is terrible .
well , it is terrible considering the last time
she left for a job , she almost didn &apos;t come back .
can &apos;t really tell her not to take the job , either .
she actually said that she wasn &apos;t gonna take it
if i wasn &apos;t comfortable .
oh , good ! you &apos;re clearly not comfortable , so ...
what am i supposed to do ?
it &apos;s a no @-@ win . i cannot win .
i make her stay , and then she resents me , i let her go ,
and i &apos;m miserable .
you want my advice ?
absolutely not .
when catherine was gonna turn down the job
that billy offered her because of me ,
you know what i told her ?
i told her to take the job .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re stupid
and you don &apos;t listen to anybody .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want her to pass by
a great career opportunity because of me .
you told your girlfriend that it was okay to take a job
with her good @-@ looking ex .
all right , that is not noble , it &apos;s stupid .
let me ask you a question then .
if gabby asked you to put your career on hold
and move to denver , would you do that ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
but i got a daughter who lives here .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
plus you &apos;d miss me too much .
plus i &apos;d miss you too much .
there you go .
lieutenant kelly .
chin , it &apos;s me .
kono , how are you ?
where are you ?
kowloon . we got a lead on the shooters
that came after us .
we managed to get the drop on one of their associates .
he give you anything ?
riku sato .
have you heard of him ?
yeah . he &apos;s the oyabun for one
of the largest yakuza families in japan .
but why is he coming after adam ?
i thought they were allies .
they were .
but something &apos;s changed .
this isn &apos;t about revenge for michael &apos;s death anymore .
how can you be so sure ?
because they don &apos;t just want adam dead ,
they want me , too .
kono ...
chin , i can handle this .
well , at least let me call the hong kong police department
so they can get you to a safe place .
no . no , sato has strong ties to the chinese triads ,
and they own the police .
we can &apos;t trust anyone right now .
all right , well , then you guys need to keep moving .
get out of hong kong . get out of asia .
that &apos;s the plan .
get me off speakerphone .
yeah ?
you promised me
you would take care of kono .
now do it .
there &apos;s got to be some mistake .
i am inclined
to agree with my son .
i &apos;m sorry , are we missing something here ?
my @-@ my firm did a full background check on dahlia .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand
how the investigators could have missed something like this .
you ran a background check on my fiancee ?
and you wonder why i never
wanted anything to do with the business .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll go talk to him .
give me a minute .
what kills me is that my mother &apos;s right .
i feel so stupid .
you &apos;re not the first guy to fall for it , nathan .
dahlia and her brother
have been running this con for years .
i hope you find her so i can look her in the eye
and ask her how she could do this to me .
yo , chin , where are you ?
i &apos;m headed toward tantalus drive .
it &apos;s the last place that dahlia &apos;s cell phone
registered a signal .
and that was at 7 : 30 last night ,
and after that , nothing .
tantalus has notoriously
bad cell phone reception .
look , she was trying to lay low .
she was on the run . maybe she chucked her phone .
or maybe she never left the area .
oh , look . look , look . it &apos;s , uh ...
catherine &apos;s boss- slash @-@ ex @-@ boyfriend .
uh , billy ? is that his name ?
yes . you know his name &apos;s billy .
huh . billy .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
they &apos;re supposed to be working .
oh , maybe he &apos;s
come to ask you for her hand in marriage .
you &apos;re actually enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
oh , we all gotta be reminded of our mistakes , babe .
billy .
what &apos;s up ?
cath just headed up to see you .
what are you doing , keeping the car warm ?
we gotta make it a short visit . we &apos;re on a job .
hey , you remember
detective danny williams ?
hey , it &apos;s my pleasure .
of course .
good to see you . again .
actually , i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
i never got a chance to thank you .
for what ?
oh , for being cool with all this .
catherine told me
how you encouraged her to take the job .
don &apos;t mention it .
truth is , i &apos;m lucky to have her .
we make a great team .
that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you , too .
little wing ,
this is big kahuna , be advised :
commander mcgarrett is headed to your position .
you guys got code names for each other ?
yeah .
that &apos;s cute .
looking sharp , rollins .
with the earpiece , the whole thing , huh ?
yeah .
billy and i are running a personal security detail
on a visiting saudi diplomat , so ...
nice .
women , i know they dress modestly there ,
but i mean , the way this guy looks at me ,
you &apos;d think i was wearing a string bikini .
what &apos;s his name ? i &apos;ll beat him up .
okay , see , that &apos;s sort of exactly
what we &apos;re being paid to prevent .
oh ! right . okay .
yes . so that would be bad .
got it .
which leads me to the reason why i &apos;m here .
what , you &apos;re not here ... i thought you &apos;d come
to show me your new pantsuit .
no , smart @-@ ass . i need a favor .
what do you need ?
so , uh ...
our client has a packed schedule tomorrow ,
and billy asked me to run some threat assessments
on all the people he &apos;s meeting with .
only ...
you don &apos;t have access to navy intel anymore .
so you thought you &apos;d come to five @-@ o
and run the background checks .
look at you . you are handsome and smart .
i don &apos;t know how i feel
about allocating five @-@ o resources
to a private security job .
okay . um ...
remind me again
how many satellites
i have repositioned for you over the years .
you owe me .
steve ...
okay , okay , okay . relax .
come on , i &apos;ll log you in .
dahlia !
dahlia ! can you hear me ?
air one to incident command .
be advised that we have the wreck in sight ,
and the victim seems to
still be within the vehicle .
air one , 10 @-@ 4 .
dahlia !
we &apos;ve stabilized your neck .
we &apos;re gonna slide you out onto a stretcher .
just stay calm .
there &apos;s a helicopter here
that &apos;s gonna take you to a hospital , okay ?
okay .
okay , dahlia .
give me a minute , mom .
i &apos;m so sorry , nathan .
i love you .
i always have .
everything you ever told me was a lie .
even your name .
how do you expect me to believe anything you say now ?
just , please , let me explain , okay ?
i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
you know , when i heard what happened to you ,
some tiny part of me
still cared whether you lived or died .
now i don &apos;t know why it mattered .
sweetheart .
sweetheart , wait , wait .
nathan !
you know what , give him some space .
you can &apos;t help him right now .
are you really sure
that dahlia did those things ?
yeah , we &apos;re , uh ... we &apos;re certain .
i mean , she left behind a trail of victims ,
so , yeah .
excuse us . please .
i &apos;m not going to pretend i &apos;m sad he &apos;s dead .
my brother was a monster .
that &apos;s why you ran
when you saw him at the wedding , huh ?
you don &apos;t know the things he &apos;s capable of .
oh , we do .
uh , we read his jacket .
we read yours , too .
i made a lot of mistakes , okay ?
i won &apos;t deny that .
but i wasn &apos;t after nathan &apos;s money .
i love him .
okay , i mean , well , it seems very convenient .
i mean , you leave a life as a con
to then fall in love with a guy
who &apos;s filthy rich .
i know how it looks .
but i didn &apos;t find out about nathan &apos;s money
until we were engaged .
i swear .
i guess i was crazy ,
thinking that my past wouldn &apos;t catch up with me
and i would actually get a fresh start .
i keep thinking if ...
only if i had just stayed
and told nathan the truth , you know ...
maybe he would have forgiven me .
but instead , you ran out on your own wedding .
when i saw brad there , i panicked .
all i knew was that i had to get away from him .
so i just got in the car and ...
drove .
how &apos;d you end up crashing the car ?
i was speeding .
there was a truck ...
it was only maybe a few minutes later
that i heard someone pull up .
i called for help .
they found me ...
there were footsteps .
no !
no !
no ! no !
that &apos;s when everything went black .
crime lab finished processing the car wreck .
they pulled a shoe print off the rear fender .
size 11 .
tread pattern matches the shoes
dixon was found dead in .
so ...
dixon , he , uh ...
follows his sister out of the wedding ,
and catches up with her
at the scene of the accident .
he &apos;s packing a gun , looking for revenge ,
but then he figures he can save a bullet
and send dahlia to her death
in a fiery wreck .
okay , well , that &apos;s one mystery solved .
but it still doesn &apos;t explain
how dixon ends up dead in a hotel room .
yeah , i don &apos;t get that , either .
i mean , if it &apos;s me , i &apos;m out of there ,
i &apos;m on the first plane .
right , but he &apos;s gotta clear the hotel room first .
but before he can get out of there ,
somebody confronts him and then shoots him with his own gun .
wait a minute .
dixon checked in using one of
his former aliases , john fitzpatrick , right ?
yeah .
so how does our killer know
what name to ask for to find the right room ?
well , maybe he knew him under that name .
hey , maybe it &apos;s a ... old accomplice
or somebody he burned .
or somebody who found out about his criminal history .
which would have come back in dahlia &apos;s background check .
barbara .
uh , come in .
how @-@ how &apos;s nathan holding up ?
i want to see the report .
i &apos;m sorry ?
the background report i had you run on dahlia .
i paid for it .
now i &apos;d like to see it .
okay , i @-@ i know you &apos;re upset .
we &apos;ve all been caught off guard by what happened .
but i can assure you there is nothing in that report
that indicates any issues .
i will be the judge of that .
all right , look ...
my investigators dropped the ball .
i &apos;m sorry .
the report in 24 hours
or you &apos;re fired .
you can have it now .
just give me a second
to pull it up on my computer .
okay .
fire me ?
i don &apos;t think so .
sit !
i don &apos;t get it , allen .
why would you keep that information from us ?
what &apos;s in it for you ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen now .
you &apos;re gonna wire $ 5 million
into a numbered account in the caymans ,
and i &apos;m gonna disappear .
call it my severance .
sorry .
you get nothing .
excuse me ?
nothing .
really ?
hey , hey , hey ! drop the weapon .
put the gun down .
put the gun down right now .
okay , okay !
hands behind your head and turn around .
get on your knees .
cross your feet .
did you get what you need ?
yeah , i &apos;d say we got everything we need .
thank you .
so you &apos;ve had a , uh ,
busy 24 hours in the aloha state .
we got , uh ...
attempted extortion , murder .
what else ?
exercising your right to silence ?
that &apos;s the first smart thing you &apos;ve done .
we matched the gun that you pulled on barbara cotchin
to the one that was used to kill brad dixon .
i figure that a lawyer would know better
than to hold onto the murder weapon .
12 years you worked for that family
without ever once receiving the recognition
that you felt you deserved .
until dahlia &apos;s background check comes back .
all you got to do
is wait for the wedding to go off without a hitch .
and then you can hold that potential scandal
over barbara cotchin &apos;s head
and get whatever you want .
the plan doesn &apos;t go the way you want it to .
dahlia &apos;s brother shows up .
you track him back to his room
and you popped him with his own gun .
that about cover it or what ?
you really think i &apos;m dumb enough to blackmail barbara cotchin ?
you go up against power like that and you lose .
dahlia ...
dhalia was a weak target .
i knew she &apos;d cut me in
on whatever con she was running .
oh , so you ... so we actually
have given you more credit than you deserve .
this was just about putting a little extra money
in your pocket , that &apos;s it ?
did you , did you ever consider
that perhaps dahlia was not marrying nathan for his money ?
what else is there ?
the german prosecutors sent over
their files this morning .
turns out they only became aware of the case
when dahlia turned herself in .
why would she do that ?
when dahlia was 14 years old ,
both her parents died and brad became her custodian .
he threatened to abandon her
if she didn &apos;t go along with the scams .
i don &apos;t know what to think anymore .
i understand .
i was thinking maybe
this would help you figure that out .
hpd found it in the car wreck .
i thought you should have it .
good luck , nathan .
&quot; for so much of my life ,
&quot; i believed i was unworthy of anyone &apos;s love .
&quot; but then i met you and everything changed .
&quot; i realized
&quot; that if you could see the good in me ,
&quot; then maybe i could see the good in myself .
&quot; the truth is that in more ways than you &apos;ll ever know ,
&quot; you saved me .
&quot; and for that reason
&quot; and so many more ,
&quot; i promise to be eternally faithful
&quot; and to honor you so long
as we both shall live . &quot;
nathan ?
when i asked you to marry me ,
i said i would love you no matter what .
and i meant what i said .
you are everything to me .
and i can &apos;t imagine my life without you .
nathan ?
it &apos;s not the beachside wedding
with the band and the orchids you love .
but i don &apos;t want to go another day without you as my wife .
we are gathered here today to join this man
and this woman
in holy matrimony .
do you , dahlia ,
take nathan to be your lawfully wedded husband ,
promising to love , honor and cherish him
as long as you both shall live ?
for thousands of years ,
one of the world &apos;s great archeological enigmas ...
grace just fell asleep .
so ... ?
so ...
i just want us to be happy .
and if that means
that i say no to this job ,
then that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
i , um , i really like that idea .
but i cannot , um ,
be the guy that makes you put your career on hold .
i can &apos;t do that .
then it &apos;s just six months .
and we will make it work .
yeah , you know , i thought about that , too .
and it six months , but then , i mean ,
there &apos;s gonna be another offer , right ?
and i ... listen , i @-@ i don &apos;t have a problem
with you coming and going .
i @-@ i really don &apos;t at all .
i mean , i &apos;d rather have you here part @-@ time than not at all .
you know , but grace ...
look , i see the way you guys are together .
i know how she feels about you .
and i ...
i cannot keep taking that away from her .
you know , i mean , the whole reason
i moved here in the first place was to give her some stability .
i ...
so ...
well , our timing really stinks , doesn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know , i ...
look , uh , before i met you ,
i , um , i was kind of looking around trying to figure out
another reason to hate this place .
because i really , really hated it .
um , and , uh ...
when i met you , you gave me ...
you made me realize what i was missing .
you know , i mean , you have no idea what that means to me .
i get it , okay ?
this is home for you now .
and ...
maybe one day it will be for me , too .
okay .
well , i have to admit .
part of me had doubts that we could make this work .
but after seeing you in action today ,
i know i made the right choice .
thanks .
although it kind of sounds like you &apos;re congratulating yourself .
it kind of did , didn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ll pick you up tomorrow at 8 : 00 .
all right , coffee and malasadas , on you .
okay .
couldn &apos;t sleep .
i wanted to make sure you got home okay is all .
how was your first day ?
uh , it was a big change .
yeah , i bet .
but in a good way .
good .
yeah .
billy already got us another gig ,
so i think ... i think we &apos;re gonna be busy .
good , i &apos;m glad .
come here .
i &apos;m gonna go wash up .
will you , um , open us a bottle of wine ?
yeah .
red or white ?
