he just about promised me a full scholarship ,
but he said he couldn &apos;t do it if i moved ,
if i ended up at another school in a different program .
this family &apos;s not doing anything
based on one conversation with one scout .
we need some kind of a commitment from the university .
look , i know i made a bloody mess of it ,
and i &apos;m sorry for putting you in the middle of it ,
but perhaps my real mistake
was falling for the wrong sister .
hi , i &apos;m jackie molina .
is this the montgomery house ?
excuse me .
if she hadn &apos;t given you back that ring ,
you &apos;d be married to her right now .
possibly .
it &apos;s him .
ian &apos;s alive .
are you sure it was him ?
if anybody finds out about the jason thing ...
you won &apos;t let that happen .
it &apos;s jason .
what &apos;s he doing back in that house ?
we just got off the phone with your therapist .
are you telling me that i can &apos;t see my friends ?
did he say he killed her ?
that &apos;s what he meant .
that &apos;s what he meant . that &apos;s what you think .
did ian say &quot; i killed alison &quot; ?
not those words .
not those words ?
no .
spencer ?
did you get outside today ?
not in this weather .
she lied to you about being out ?
who would she wanna show this to ?
i can only think of one person who would care .
ian .
seriously ? you think jason &apos;s hiding him in that house ?
why would he ? ian killed his sister .
that doesn &apos;t makes sense .
look , i didn &apos;t say i was positive .
i &apos;m just telling you guys
melissa is sneaking out to meet ian ... on foot .
okay , your sister needs one of those dog collars .
the ones that zap your ass whenever you leave the property .
hanna ...
it &apos;s not just that .
her phone rings , and she has to leave the room to answer it .
what &apos;s up with that ?
i still don &apos;t buy jason would help him .
didn &apos;t he call ian a &quot; phony jerk &quot; ?
yeah , when did that change ?
it &apos;s jason , you guys .
who knows what to believe ?
he was wasted the whole summer ali disappeared .
he &apos;d probably take that guy in for a six @-@ pack .
but i thought jason told you he was clean and sober now .
emily , i &apos;ve had , like , three conversations with him .
i never asked him for a urine sample .
okay , gagging now .
so how are we supposed to keep 24 / 7 tabs on melissa
when we &apos;re not even allowed inside your house ?
you guys ...
what did you see ?
hanna , let &apos;s go !
no , i can &apos;t find my other shoe !
ian , is that you ?
what &apos;s going on ? what are you doing ?
looking for my ring . would you mind getting up ?
what ring ?
my wedding ring .
why would you take it off ?
it was cutting off my circulation .
one of the perks of pregnancy .
none of your shoes fit
and your fingers turn into sausages .
do you want me to get that ?
your phone is buzzing . do you want me to get it ?
keep looking , would you ?
hey , i &apos;m not alone . let me get upstairs , okay ?
i love her .
morning .
hi . what &apos;s going on ?
your father has a meeting on this side of town .
and i thought i &apos;d drop by and give you a lift to school .
oh , well , mona usually picks me up .
yeah , that &apos;s what i hear . next time i &apos;ll call ahead .
maybe monday or another day next week .
so you &apos;re staying in rosewood ?
for a while . i can get some business done at the hotel .
and i wanna be here for you .
tom , you want some coffee to go ?
no , no , i &apos;m good , thanks .
okay , then ...
uh , have a great day at school .
bye .
so what was so funny ?
what ?
when i came downstairs , you guys were laughing .
oh , that .
your dad reminded me of
the first time i made dinner for his mother .
while i cooking , your grandmother
re @-@ arranged the living room furniture .
i came out and didn &apos;t recognize my own house .
she is a piece of work .
well , that &apos;s isabelle &apos;s problem now , right ?
i &apos;m just saying , if he &apos;s marrying her ,
why are you so jolly and going
out to buy him hazelnut creamer for his coffee ?
because dairy makes him sick .
hanna , your father and i have a long history ,
and believe it or not ,
we used to laugh ... a lot .
hmm , i must &apos;ve missed that part .
hanna ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i just think it &apos;s weird
that you &apos;re suddenly all team tom .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m fully aware of who your father is and what he &apos;s done ,
but he has his moments .
look , just because somebody hurt us once ,
doesn &apos;t mean we have to permanently delete them from our phone book .
things change . people grow .
whoo , we gotta find a better place to do this .
somewhere preferably with a fan .
good luck .
we &apos;re gonna have to dig a tunnel under the school .
uh , yeah , not with those hands .
you need some serious moisturizer .
this letter isn &apos;t that bad , emily .
it &apos;s bad .
won &apos;t your mom be impressed
the scout even took the time to write ?
here , use this . it cost more than my purse .
guys , it &apos;s a &quot; maybe &quot; letter .
my mom needs to see something real ,
something that says
&quot; let her stay in rosewood . we want her .
don &apos;t take her to texas . &quot;
em , there are other colleges .
yeah , other scouts will want you .
when ? my mom &apos;s already packed up the whole kitchen .
she keeps telling me how much i &apos;m gonna like the rodeo .
let &apos;s just do this later , okay ?
um , what about after school ?
i can &apos;t today . i &apos;ve got field hockey .
i have swim practice .
i &apos;m starting my class at hollis .
is jackie gonna be teaching it ?
no , no , this is not about stalking .
if ezra says it &apos;s over between them , i believe him .
so , what , you &apos;re just gonna hang around campus with binoculars ?
i &apos;m following our therapist &apos;s
orders on having separate time , okay ?
it &apos;s an extension course .
if i happen to bump into ezra ,
that &apos;s just a bonus .
oh , nice bonus .
yeah , great . everyone &apos;s got a life except for me .
i thought you were gonna go to the mall with mona .
stealing moisturizer is not a life . it &apos;s a hobby .
it &apos;s getting really boring .
you stole this ?
no . it &apos;s a sample .
hey there . i thought you were done with this place .
i am .
just dropping off paperwork for the g.e.d.
i still have five minutes before the bell .
you wanna grab some coffee ?
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m starting a new job , supposed to be there by nine .
really ? that &apos;s great . where ?
can i walk you to class ?
sure .
it is a carpentry job , right ?
well , that &apos;s awesome . who &apos;s it for ?
jason dilaurentis .
yeah , i kinda thought you &apos;d be surprised .
i was , too , but he needs help building a fence around his--
toby , you can &apos;t work for him .
i have to . i need cash to buy tools and a truck .
a truck ?
there &apos;s a cabinet maker in yardley
who wants to hire me ,
but he said i need my own wheels .
still , you shouldn &apos;t go anywhere near that house .
spencer , i need to get out of my own house ,
and breaking out of there is gonna take major bucks .
even a used getaway car is more than i &apos;ve got saved up .
and the seller &apos;s already got another offer .
just promise me that you won &apos;t go inside jason &apos;s house .
why ?
because i don &apos;t ...
totally trust him .
please , promise me .
promise .
oh . hey , lucas . what &apos;s the rush ?
oh , hi .
sit .
i can &apos;t .
i promised i &apos;d give caleb a ride
to the hardware store during lunch .
you and caleb are tight now ?
he &apos;s ... living at my house .
my parents are letting him crash until he figures things out .
so is he staying here for a while or is he going back to arizona ?
you should probably ask him that yourself .
i &apos;ll see you .
no , wait . what about after school ?
you wanna do something fun ?
or something not fun , like studying ?
i &apos;ve got yearbook .
we &apos;re going to the printer on monday .
yeah , yeah , i get it .
so how come i don &apos;t see you
hanging around with your posse anymore ?
oh , you know , just busy .
figured we could use some separate time .
okay , was that your parents &apos; idea or was that yours ?
guess .
okay , we could probably use some help on layout .
why don &apos;t you meet me after last period ?
yeah .
if i say i lost it ,
they &apos;ll let me re @-@ take the picture , right ?
wait , why re @-@ take it ? it &apos;s perfect .
you look very ... studious .
it looks like a mug shot .
yeah , like a very studious young lady from a prison laundry .
that is what you &apos;re going for , right ?
actually , when i was taking this ,
i was thinking about being released from prison .
you remember that prison called &quot; high school , &quot; right ?
ah , yes , i do .
do you miss it ?
not it as much as you .
can i just say how nice this is ,
reaching for your hand and
not worrying about who might be watching us ?
uh , aria , your dad does teach here three days a week .
yeah , i know , but friday &apos;s not one of them .
bye .
oh , hey there . just grab a smock .
there &apos;s a couple spots in back .
good @-@ bye .
just go ahead . take a seat .
looking for someone ?
uh , no . i &apos;m ...
i just thought maybe toby was--
he left ... about an hour ago .
something wrong ?
no , i thought you were inside .
why is that ?
because i thought that you were the only one living here .
i am .
i &apos;ll let toby know you stopped by .
there &apos;s no way jason could &apos;ve closed those curtains .
maybe it was the wind .
emily , the window was closed !
there was somebody in that upstairs room !
okay , i &apos;m just saying , you could &apos;ve imagined it .
sometimes when all you have is a hammer ,
everything looks like a nail .
why are you talking to me like ben franklin ?
资本主义精神最完美的代表
there &apos;s a murderer living next door . my parents are in new york ,
and all i have to defend myself is a hockey stick !
well , ask toby . if he &apos;s working there , maybe he could--
no , i don &apos;t want toby to get hurt .
if i tell him , he &apos;s gonna barge in there and try to act like a hero .
you &apos;re right . don &apos;t tell toby .
emily ?
i gotta go .
is there any way that you can sleep over here tonight ?
yeah , that &apos;s never gonna happen . lock your door .
you think your neighbors will call the cops ?
everyone &apos;s used to it .
that place turns into party central ,
whenever ali &apos;s parents go out of town .
do you want anything else ?
i &apos;m good .
ali ? what &apos;s going on ?
can i crash here tonight ?
there &apos;s no friggin &apos; way i &apos;m sleeping there .
there &apos;s not enough locks on my bedroom door .
are jason &apos;s friends hassling you ?
jason doesn &apos;t have friends .
he has idiots who use him to get wasted
and act like animal planet .
were you the only girl ?
of course .
what i should do is call my grandma .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s been counting on the money .
all i have to do is say one word about him and his loser friends ,
and she &apos;ll write him out of her will so fast ...
god , he makes me sick .
can i get a soda ?
sure .
ali , you &apos;re welcome to stay here .
thanks .
are you okay ?
yeah , i was just ...
thinking about my grandma .
your family has the worst apples .
emily , have you tackled your closet yet ?
uh , i &apos;m still sorting .
just figuring out what i want to give away .
honey , we &apos;re not moving to the moon .
just put that stuff in storage .
would you answer the phone ?
it &apos;s paige . i &apos;ll call her back .
okay , you can take that call ,
but just come downstairs when you &apos;re done , all right ?
hello ?
do you remember the night that ali came over and crashed our sleepover ?
i think something really ugly was going down between her and jason .
okay , spencer , you &apos;ve gotta stop playing harriet the spy ,
otherwise you &apos;re gonna lose your mind .
no , what if ian was over there that night ?
what if she was blackmailing both of them ?
spencer ...
where was jason the night ali was killed ?
hey , how many photos can i fit on this page ?
lucas ?
uh , four .
four max .
who &apos;s that ?
who ? her ?
uh , she &apos;s doing the appendix .
does the appendix have a name ?
danielle . danielle something .
well , does she know you &apos;re crushing on her ?
she just joined , like , a week ago .
we &apos;ve barely said more than two words to each other .
well , if the two words were &quot; you &apos;re cute &quot; --
stop . stop . she &apos;s not interested .
she doesn &apos;t even know that i &apos;m in the room .
of course she knows who you are , lucas .
you &apos;re the whole photo department .
can we not have this conversation ?
well , she seems sweet .
so what &apos;s stopping you from asking her out ?
knowing where i sit on the totem pole in this high school .
according to your pal mona ,
i &apos;m right below the kid who blows his nose on notebook paper .
well , we &apos;re not in 7th grade anymore .
so if you like her , go for it .
okay , we got too many pictures of the marching band . toss that .
seriously , just make a move .
you , of all people , kcnow my batting average , hanna .
here . put that with the drama club .
still can &apos;t find it ?
you should call mom or dad .
maybe one of them found it
and they put it somewhere so it &apos;d be safe .
they didn &apos;t . i already spoke to mom .
maybe you should sleep in here tonight ,
instead of the barn .
maybe .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t like being by myself ,
and i don &apos;t sleep well when i &apos;m alone .
melissa ? you get why i &apos;m scared , right ?
somebody broke in here last week ,
and i know about stuff that i wish that i didn &apos;t .
what are you trying to say ?
i guess i &apos;m just hoping that if it came down to it ,
that you would protect me ...
over someone who &apos;s not me .
do remember kendra santoni ,
that bully that made me her
punching bag in elementary school ?
remember the day that i came home
with that red mark on my neck
and i was afraid to tell mom
that kendra smacked me with a jump @-@ rope ?
then the next day on the playground , you cornered her
and you said that if she ever touched me again ,
you &apos;d make her eat that jump @-@ rope .
i knew that you had my back .
remember ?
you don &apos;t remember pushing her up against a wall ?
no , i don &apos;t , and honestly ,
i &apos;m kind of dealing with major stuff right now .
my husband has been missing for nearly a week .
i &apos;m not looking to stroll down memory lane .
don &apos;t make me choose between you and my husband , spencer .
did she know that i was taking that class ?
she was there first .
why can &apos;t i just escape high school ?
probably &apos; cause you &apos;re still in it .
not helping .
aria , maybe the universe is telling you something .
maybe you &apos;re in the class with jenna
so you guys can move on .
you &apos;re both talented artists .
you probably have a lot more in common
than you think .
i just don &apos;t believe that
jenna &apos;s a very forgiving kind of person .
maybe i &apos;ll just take a painting class .
look , do what you want .
i &apos;m just saying , you can run , but you can &apos;t hide .
if you &apos;re able to make things right with jenna ,
why not do it ?
spencer , don &apos;t touch that coconut water ! it &apos;s mine !
no , no , no , i know that ...
that &apos;s not why i came here okay ?
that has nothing to do with it .
i &apos;ll call you back .
i &apos;ll call you back .
morning , sleepy .
your mom asked if i &apos;d come look at the water heater .
where is she ?
your mom ?
she &apos;s gone to the store to grab some things .
look , hanna , i &apos;m don &apos;t know
how much of that you overheard--
so was that mom on the phone ?
no .
isabelle .
we have some different ideas about the ,
uh , scale of this wedding .
常作为棒球比赛场地
if she had her way , we &apos;d be renting out veterans &apos; stadium .
dad , you don &apos;t have to share this .
it &apos;s just things are a little tense right now ...
between me and isabelle .
does mom know that ?
your mom catches on pretty fast .
usually faster than i do .
you gotta stay out of it .
no , but if he ends up huring her--
hanna , i tried protecting my mom ...
and it completely blew up in my face .
you just gotta let them work it out for themselves .
what is that ?
read it .
... &quot; if you continue as rosewood &apos;s m.v.p. and anchor
until the end of swim season ,
we can offer you a full schol-- &quot;
no way ! em , the scout changed his mind ?
this is amazing !
that means you don &apos;t have to move !
wait , let me see this .
so what &apos;d your mom say ?
she hasn &apos;t seen it .
why ?
&apos;cause i haven &apos;t mailed it yet .
what ?
wait , did you write this letter ?
oh , my god !
you are a total rock star , emily fields !
you are totally getting me into harvard !
emily , i would not mail this .
oh , i love it . here , let me see if i have an extra stamp .
this just feels really wrong .
oh , really ? and taking an art class with jenna isn &apos;t ?
i hope your first assignment is how to make a weapon .
okay , i never said that i was actually staying in the class .
whatever . i &apos;m still working that out .
okay , once your parents read this--
oh , big deal . she changed a few words .
it &apos;s like alison used to say , &quot; you &apos;re not lying .
you &apos;re just pre @-@ telling the truth . &quot;
hey , does it matter if it looks a little used ?
there &apos;s got to be another way .
there isn &apos;t .
wanna take a break ?
nah .
dude , you &apos;ve been working non @-@ stop .
it doesn &apos;t have to be built in a day .
you got another job to go to or what ?
no .
i &apos;m guessing people around here
are still giving you a hard time , huh ?
just for the record , toby ,
i never believed you were guilty of anything ...
except maybe being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
i &apos;ve been there .
who &apos;s that ? melissa ?
uh , no . hi .
it &apos;s spencer .
why would you think that i was melissa ?
has she been coming over a lot ?
uh , a couple times .
mailman keeps giving you guys my stuff .
i &apos;m gonna grab a drink . you want something , toby ?
i &apos;m okay .
you ?
no , thanks .
what &apos;s wrong ?
is there any way i can
convince you to quit right now for good ?
spencer , i just started ,
and he gave me a huge cash advance .
enough to buy your truck ?
i &apos;m sure that truck &apos;s already sold .
well , did you call ?
spencer , that job in yardley &apos;s
going to someone else .
they &apos;re not gonna wait for me .
yeah , but there &apos;ll be others .
maybe , but right now , this is all i &apos;ve got .
i &apos;d invite you guys inside ,
but the place is kinda crazy .
cut myself .
i &apos;m sorry , what is your name ?
me ?
anita .
do you mind giving jenna a little help , please ?
i can do it .
oh , thanks , bryce .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
so i have a question ...
how many times has the choir been listed in the appendix ?
um , they &apos;re listed by individual names .
do you think i missed someone ?
i &apos;ll have to check .
lucas took so many great pictures ..
it sucks that we can &apos;t use all of them .
but i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll just frame the rest
and sell &apos; em on ebay .
why would anybody buy a picture of
a choir that they &apos;re not in ?
could be a collector &apos;s item someday .
lucas has already sold a lot of his work .
who &apos;s lucas ?
my friend over there .
it &apos;s weird calling him my friend .
i mean , that &apos;s what he is ,
even if i wanted it to be more at one point .
i didn &apos;t just have the energy to compete .
compete with who ?
with every other girl in the 11th grade .
he &apos;s got that quiet nerd thing going on ,
but it &apos;s just a cover .
he totally has a wild side .
it &apos;s a real diamond .
i &apos;ll be back for it on monday .
as soon as the banks open , i &apos;ll have the cash .
so you said .
is anyone gonna be missing this ring over the weekend ?
what ? no , of course not .
i don &apos;t want no trouble .
like i said , it &apos;s mine .
i just need some cash till monday .
all right .
thank you .
see you monday .
you meant this monday , right ? like in two days ?
yeah , yeah .
hanna , wait up !
i thought we were done .
what did you say to danielle ?
why ?
she came over to me as we were packing up
and asked to see more of my photos .
you told her i sold my pictures online ?
yeah , so ? you &apos;ve sold other things .
okay , maybe it was a mistake ,
but at least now she knows your name .
she wants to grab coffee with me sometime next week .
ooh , congrats .
why did you speak to her ?
because i &apos;m your friend , lucas .
it was painful watching you drool .
no , i mean , what &apos;s behind it ?
last time you were this nice to me ,
i was just a body @-@ shield to help you break up with sean .
lucas , can &apos;t you trust
that i was just doing you a solid because i care about you ?
look , i apologized for what happened that night with sean .
it was a mistake ,
but i don &apos;t want to be judged for the rest of my life
by my biggest mistake .
people change , okay ? they grow .
well , then ...
thank you .
emily .
i found this in the attic .
you want me to give that stuff away ?
oh , god , no , honey .
i wouldn &apos;t even trust this with the movers .
i think you and i will just take care of this box , okay ?
mom , are you okay ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i &apos;m just ...
emily , it must &apos;ve been so hard for you
to hide who you are ,
to think that if you told me the truth ,
i wouldn &apos;t still love you no matter what .
mom , i don &apos;t feel that way anymore .
i know you don &apos;t .
but it wasn &apos;t easy getting here , right ?
okay , i &apos;ve got a lot of packing to do .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and finish up your studying ,
and then we &apos;ll just go out to dinner .
okay .
all right .
spencer .
take it . it &apos;s yours .
are you crazy ?
do you know how long it &apos;ll take me to pay you back ?
well , you have a job to get to tomorrow . in yardley , right ?
i love you so much .
i wanted to say that first .
就算是在电话亭里我也愿意嫁给你
anita ? could you do me a favor ?
would you mind putting this on the turntable against the wall ?
sure .
and if you wouldn &apos;t mind cleaning everything else off ,
that would be perfect .
i finally get a chance to see how it turned out .
i mean , i can &apos;t really see anything .
maybe just some shadows .
light it for me , would you ?
please . i would love to know
if it looked like what i saw in my head .
and can you turn the lights off , too ?
what do you see ?
i used to swim a lot .
there was this lake that we would go to .
it wasn &apos;t very deep ,
but i loved to glide along the bottom ,
then turn around and look up .
the sunlight on the surface would break into a million pieces ...
like beads .
and as you got closer ,
the light would bounce and it would dance and ...
that &apos;s sort of what i was going for ,
but i ...
i can &apos;t see ... anything .
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s kinda like what you said , like being underwater .
the light &apos;s soft and it &apos;s--
aria ?
is that aria ?
please answer me .
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s me .
blow out the candle .
jenna
blow it out !
no , not here . stay down the road .
i wanna make sure she &apos;s asleep .
perfect . i &apos;ll see you then .
emily , i found this on the doormat .
it must &apos;ve been delivered when we were out at dinner .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a letter from danby university .
it &apos;s addressed to you .
don &apos;t you want to open it ?
well , do you mind if i open it ?
okay .
oh , honey ... you did it .
they want you on their team .
mr. rabin says
&quot; if you continue as rosewood &apos;s mvp
and anchor until the end of swim season ,
we can offer you a full scholarship for freshman year . &quot;
look at this ! read it !
honey , it &apos;s fantastic ! congratulations !
everything you wanted . you know what ?
we &apos;ve gotta skype your dad !
and we can actually hold this right up to the computer
so he can read it himself !
okay ? he &apos;s going to be so proud of you !
emily , where are you , honey ?
your dad wants to talk to you !
so wait , who &apos;s anita ?
no one . me . i was , okay .
i only said that because i didn &apos;t want jenna to know i was there .
well , yeah , but she did know .
only after i said something .
i had to .
i thought it was safe .
no , anita was safe . aria is not .
i feel like i just made things worse .
if jenna is &quot; a , &quot; i totally rattled her cage .
she &apos;s on the move .
i &apos;m ready .
let &apos;s do it .
is it him ? is it ian ?
i can &apos;t tell .
of course it &apos;s him ,
but whose car is that ?
wait , that &apos;s not ian .
is that wren ?
wren ?
he &apos;s in on this , too ?
what &apos;s he giving her ?
probably painkillers .
melissa does drugs ?
no , not for her . for ian .
you fall from a bell tower ,
you &apos;re gonna need more than an ice @-@ pack .
wow . only melissa would ask the guy she dumped
to help the murderer she married .
yeah , i &apos;ve seen a lot of these come through here .
this one was a real beauty .
put everything else in that case to shame .
yeah , figured i wouldn &apos;t see her again .
there you go . i had a hunch it wasn &apos;t hers .
