oh , cece . are you two kids back together ?
she wishes .
no , plumbing &apos;s out-- severe clogging .
i &apos;m sorry i asked .
this is what happens .
four models with protein deficiencies ,
sharing a shower .
they shed like a ... like a four @-@ dollar christmas sweater .
guys , guess what ?
i just made a breakthrough with a student .
yeah , it &apos;s true .
don &apos;t , please .
uh , jess ?
you know we love you , we all support you ...
i &apos;m breaking through with students .
... but when you do things like this , i &apos;m sorry ...
bowl .
okay .
it &apos;s just not satisfying .
i think it is .
okey . you said you had a breakthrough .
it &apos;s just a whole new world teaching adults .
this week , i gave them an assignment .
i said write whatever you want
just load it up with descriptive imagery .
my fluffy pillow ,
my yellowy fluffy pillow ,
next to my dog , my hairy dog ,
my beloved hairy dog ,
while i diddle myself .
excellent .
he was a merman .
he was the last of his kind ,
and he needed a mother for his mer @-@ child .
he was not a mer @-@ gentleman .
can &apos;t wait to hear more .
i just can &apos;t connect with them and i don &apos;t know why .
look , jess , you can &apos;t teach people how to write .
not true .
i say that as a writer .
also not true .
a writing class is for
somebody who doesn &apos;t think lyrically in terms of ,
like , poetic words that just ... are strung ...
you said you had a breakthrough .
so i have this student whose name is edgar and he was not getting it .
and then today
he turned in this amazing story .
nick , actually , you should read this .
writers don &apos;t read-- we write .
jessica day calls it &quot; a must read . &quot;
look at that font .
what is this amateur hour ?
at least use palatino .
good evening , everyone .
or should i say morning ?
hey , winston .
do you guys have any agave ?
we might have some pressed lentil syrup
in the mixin &apos;s cabinet .
thank you .
oh , my goodness .
okay , uh ...
okay , you know what ?
hey , look ...
i just felt the side , the side
anyway , so it &apos;s ...
i didn &apos;t mean to ...
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s ...
other way , now .
i will fight you , jack .
no , not again .
not ... no ! no !
jump out the way , jessica ?
what the hell is wrong with you just waving
that thing around like an idiot ?
guys , listen to this .
&quot; by day , i &apos;m a plumber .
by night , i &apos;m a stalker . &quot;
you read it .
&quot; i sit in the bushes
wearing a gimp costume , stalking my prey . &quot;
he &apos;s the first person i got
to use first person narrative .
i &apos;m an amazing teacher .
very engaging , keep going . i &apos;m hooked .
okay , &quot; my prey is a deer .
&quot; her eyes are big , too big .
before she can blink those big eyes ,
i &apos;m stabbing her .
i stab and stab .
i love stabbing . &quot;
sounds like he likes stabbing .
&quot; after all the stabbing ... &quot;
it &apos;s repetitive , but ...
... &quot; i wash my hands in her dark red blood ? ! &quot;
listen to that detail .
this man is psychotic .
it &apos;s fiction .
there &apos;s no such thing as a gimp costume .
no , gimp costume &apos;s a real thing .
that &apos;s a real thing .
you &apos;ve seen me in one before .
i just don &apos;t think you should be in a room
with this creep , twice a week .
it is not safe .
are you worried about me , miller ?
yeah , i &apos;m a little worried about you .
and if you won &apos;t do anything about it ,
then i &apos;m taking it into my own hands .
i &apos;m doing a little investigation .
investigating ? please .
you &apos;re just gonna google his name .
i am way beyond that .
you &apos;re typing his name into google .
we can all see the screen .
see the screen , dude .
this is a private investigation !
are you ... i wanted to talk to you about the ...
regrettable contact
between cece &apos;s ...
her @-@ her down there
and my , uh ...
my parts .
you practically shish @-@ kebabbed her .
is this something i should apologize for ?
just let it go , man .
you pogo &apos;d her .
i &apos;m sorry , what did you say , &quot; pogo &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t , um ...
i heard &quot; pogo &quot; -- what is that ?
look , winston , fine .
it &apos;s what we call what you did
this morning , okay ?
it &apos;s a short ... it &apos;s a shorthand .
why do you have a shorthand , schmidt ,
because it happens so often ?
you pogo &apos;d me once .
you pogo &apos;d jess twice .
hey , it &apos;s not sexual .
nick &apos;s never been pogo &apos;d directly .
you did get his pizza one time ...
which , by the way , is a whole another debate--
how did you not feel that ?
let me get this straight--
you guys sit around and talk about this ?
your penis actually changed the channel ,
uh , when we were watching the bears game once .
you don &apos;t think me , nick and jess
talk about you behind your back ?
because we do .
you have more pogos than anyone .
you are completely misusing the word pogo .
you are the pogo king .
pogo king .
pogo king ?
so i wanted to talk about your creative imagery assignments .
guys .
i really felt like i was buried
under a giant , gleaming , powdery avalanche of adjectives .
don &apos;t mean to interrupt , i just hear you &apos;re the best
teacher of adults ?
oh , no .
i wonder if there &apos;s room for one more ?
no !
how you guys doing ? i &apos;m julius pepperwood .
not now , okay ?
i &apos;m an ex @-@ cop , ex @-@ marine .
i &apos;m here to learn how to write short fiction .
okay , julius , just ... take a seat and , um ,
keep small .
i &apos;m from chicago .
thin @-@ crust pizza ? no , thank you .
i &apos;m from chicago .
so , for a fun follow @-@ up ...
sorry , i &apos;m late .
no , problem , edgar .
we &apos;re just going over our
descriptive imagery . i &apos;m sorry , dear ,
i can &apos;t hear you .
mr. pepperwood ?
i &apos;m gonna move closer , if you don &apos;t mind .
no , you don &apos;t have to go ... stay over there .
how you doing , pal ?
i &apos;m julius pepperwood .
edgar .
what are you doing ?
if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,
why are you late today , edgar ?
traffic , it really killed me .
it killed you ?
mr. pepperwood .
would you say that it stabbed you ?
say that again ?
how about glasses on or off ?
teach , if i keep them on ,
am i a bad boy ?
all right , honey , i &apos;ll take them off .
that &apos;s a whole different lens to see that blue dress .
no .
okay , let &apos;s refocus .
let &apos;s talk about the , um , four classifications of conflict .
we talked about it last week . it &apos;s in the workbook , um ...
anybody want to help me ?
four classifications of conflict ?
anybody ? anybody ...
so , no one has signed up for office hours
and i just want you to know that you can talk to me about anything .
adios .
anything at all .
what are you doing ?
nothing , man , you look good in your dockers .
what ? nothing happened .
i &apos;m julius pepperwood .
let it go .
why did you do that ?
the wind .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
is everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s good .
oh , everything &apos;s fine , bro .
what &apos;s happening right now ?
sorry , edgar , um , i really
loved your story .
um , i wanted to give you some notes-- is there any time
you could come in ... to office hours ?
yeah , that be really cool .
i &apos;m really excited .
um , i &apos;m available anytime , so ...
i &apos;ll check my calendar .
yup .
can &apos;t get service around here .
wednesday i got to go to the bird store .
uh , what about wednesday afternoon ?
he &apos;s my uncle .
winston , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re home .
i know what my pogo is .
it &apos;s that i dance kind of like a sea snake .
yeah , not even close , schmidt .
what are you talk ... i know this it , man .
is it that i barge into people &apos;s showers ?
it &apos;s my caterpillar eyebrows-- well , look .
they &apos;re gone .
nick , you &apos;ve gone way too far ! way too far .
well , if you &apos;re here for edgar &apos;s notebook , you &apos;re too late .
where &apos;s the notebook ?
nick ! what &apos;s my one rule ?
it &apos;s to not steal your yarn .
don &apos;t steal my yarn , man .
it &apos;s my one thing .
but look at what was inside of his notebook .
okay , he was doodling in class , nick .
weapons , dripping with blood ?
that is not a doodle .
what are you , the doodle police ?
there &apos;s no doodle police , are there ?
really ?
i can &apos;t believe you still don &apos;t believe me .
jessica ...
exhibit d.
he did this .
i &apos;m going to edgar &apos;s house , i &apos;m looking for more proof .
no , nick ,
you &apos;re not spying on the one student that i have a connection with .
i have the address right here .
no .
give me the ...
no !
i have the address memorized .
fine , then i &apos;m coming , too .
to bail you out of jail when you get arrested for trespassing .
fine , then you &apos;ll see that i was right .
fine !
and you &apos;ll also see who gets there first .
maybe we should take one car .
just , like , for the environment .
yeah , that makes sense-- we can drive together .
fine !
fine !
it &apos;s my mole , isn &apos;t it ?
well , consider it gone .
game , set , pogo .
chill out , man , it &apos;s not your mole .
just tell me , this is the worst .
this is not the worst , schmidt-- the worst
is actually knowing .
knowing that your friends
sit around every single night
talking about your pogo .
what &apos;s a pogo ?
those brows don &apos;t freak you out ?
i &apos;ve seen worse .
a pogo is what your friends talk about
when you leave the room .
like your barnacle toenails ?
you guys talk about my toenails ?
never ...
talk about your toenails , sch ... schmidt .
i know my toenails are
a little rugged .
woodsy .
i mean , i have never wondered
if you could shimmy up a palm tree .
but it &apos;s because i have a keratin surplus , i mean ...
they &apos;re not that bad , look at these things .
schmidt !
it looks like an open swiss army knife .
most of them are hard , but one of them is really , really soft .
i know , i know , i know--
we &apos;ll just talk about what my pogo is .
what &apos;s my pogo ?
is it the way i say &quot; pan &quot; ?
pan , pan , pan .
look , cece , this is more of just a loft thing .
just thank your lucky stars
you don &apos;t have calcified mongrel toes !
things sound like a dang ol &apos; crab .
there it is .
if anything &apos;s gonna go down , we need a safe word .
nothing &apos;s gonna go down unless we make it go down .
if pepperwood taught me anything ...
there &apos;s no pepperwood .
never get caught without a safe word .
we &apos;re gonna go with &quot; apricot . &quot;
that &apos;s way too normal . we need to , like ,
go with something weird , like &quot; dragon slippers . &quot;
what ?
i use &quot; apricot &quot; too much in my normal life .
why do you use &quot; apricot &quot; so much ?
what am i supposed to call them , &quot; sweet tangy balls &quot; ?
don &apos;t call them &quot; sweet tangy balls , &quot; jessica .
well , that &apos;s why we can &apos;t use ...
nick ... nick ...
nick , oh !
shh ! come on ...
nick !
call me julius pepperwood , please .
you look ridiculous .
if we &apos;re hiding from people ,
why does it matter what i call you ?
i got my eyes and you get my six .
no , no , what does this mean ?
i &apos;m pretty sure this ...
this means &quot; right turn bicycle . &quot;
no , i &apos;m pretty sure this means &quot; stop ... &quot;
it means &quot; right turn . &quot;
nick , seriously-- use your words .
don &apos;t use ...
okay , these are my words .
freaking swat sign language .
i &apos;m not ...
apricot , apricot , apricot .
close your mouth , close your eyes .
edgar lives with his mother . of course he does .
so ? a lot of normal people live with their mothers .
like my uncle randy .
he can &apos;t go near parks .
he was cleared .
you &apos;ve got to ...
apricot ! apricot !
get over here now !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s in that duffel bag ?
he &apos;s the plumber from the story .
how did i not see this before ?
what was i saying ?
oh , my god , you were right .
yes , say that again ,
say that again .
you were right , you were right ,
you were right about everything .
don &apos;t ever forget you &apos;re saying it !
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe you were right .
i was a right about everything !
what the hell is in that duffel bag ?
i don &apos;t know . no , nick .
nick , you &apos;re gonna get us killed .
get down .
nick ... nick ...
oh , my ... jessica , turn it off .
turn it off !
oh , my god , it &apos;s edgar .
what do i do ?
you turn it ... here .
turn it off . i don &apos;t know how to do this .
okay .
oh , my god .
get the hell out of here .
jess , what are you doing ?
that is ridiculous . there was plenty of room .
it seemed like a good idea .
why would you go under a van ?
let &apos;s leave .
you will not believe what just happened .
nick was right .
i was right .
oh , my god , what happened to your eyebrows ?
you look like audrey hepburn .
don &apos;t we own an industrial @-@ size paper cutter ?
whatever .
what the hell is that ?
so close to the eating area !
winston told me that you guys make fun of my gremlin toenails .
that you call them &quot; clickety- clacks , &quot;
or &quot; centaur boots . &quot;
what is wrong with you , winston ?
what is wrong with me ? besides my pogo .
i told him . it just kind of popped out .
you understand what that &apos;s like , right , winston ?
okay , you know what ?
don &apos;t act like we don &apos;t talk about you two behind your backs .
because we do . you both have pogos , my friends .
okay , let &apos;s take a deep breath and ask ourselves
if this conversation is worth ruining our friendships over .
tell me my pogo .
i need to know my pogo .
you guys need to tell me . i can take it .
lay it on me !
you know , it &apos;s kind of a loft thing . is it my pies ?
are they too tart ?
pies can &apos;t be a pogo , okay ?
my koala claws , now that &apos;s a pogo !
at least you can hide your pogo in a shoe .
they make shoes for your penis-- they &apos;re called pants !
tell me my pogo .
jessica , no .
tell me my pogo !
you &apos;re a know @-@ it @-@ all !
huge know @-@ it @-@ all .
the worst .
oh , i &apos;m the worst know @-@ it @-@ all in the world ? please .
hate hyperbolic speak . please .
now you know your pogo , you truly know it all .
there i go being a smart @-@ ass again .
i mean , that , that could be my pogo .
and then there was one .
oh , no , no , no , i &apos;m sure
that you guys have stuff you laugh at me behind my back .
we don &apos;t laugh about your pogo , nick .
yeah . we &apos;re worried about you .
you &apos;re worried about me ?
we &apos;re worried that you &apos;re not gonna make it .
make it to what ?
just in general .
&apos;cause you don &apos;t take care of yourself .
sometimes i &apos;ll crumple up vitamins
and i &apos;ll put them in your food .
we all take turns sneaking money into your pants pockets
before we put them in the dryer .
yeah ? well , i hope you &apos;re happy .
the pogos are out .
the loft dynamic is ruined .
but what if i talk like a baby ?
you &apos;re still hot . that &apos;s all we &apos;re gonna talk about .
a tiny little baby !
cut into these , please .
oh ... ! a ladder ...
that &apos;ll do .
okay , okay .
oh , this is bad .
oh , this is ... this is very bad .
oh , no , oh , no-- no , no- no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no-- oh , god , oh , god .
hello .
jess , he wants to kill you !
what ... ?
i am in his shed right now ,
what ?
and there are drawings on the wall of you ,
and bloody weapons
and googly eyes .
googly eyes are actually kind of sexy , but that &apos;s beside ...
jess , i will not let you be in a room alone with this guy .
you &apos;re the deer in his story .
he wants to kill you .
you &apos;re the deer , you &apos;re the deer , you &apos;re the deer .
i &apos;m at school and i &apos;m doing office hours ...
get out now !
okay , i &apos;ll just , i &apos;ll just keep you on the line ,
and then i &apos;ll say the safe word , okay ?
i &apos;ll just say it like ... apricots ! apricots !
good . yeah , yeah , that &apos;s what you say if you see edgar .
apricots ! really , apricots !
oh , no . okay , okay , stop it .
he &apos;s there . okay .
i thought it was gonna be &quot; dragon slippers . &quot;
is this a bad time or ... ?
no , no , no , no . i just have a deaf grocer .
apricots ! apricots !
and butter .
i &apos;m coming .
welcome to office hours . um ...
i found my ending .
yeah ?
it &apos;s pretty risky . i &apos;m not sure
i &apos;m gonna be able to get away with it .
remember when you told me
to base my characters on people from my own life ?
well , i based one on you .
so flattered .
and then i realized
that there was only one way for the story to end .
you need to die .
apricot , apricot .
no ! hey ... !
* look at that notebook . *
you said , &quot; great literature is surprising . &quot;
what &apos;s more surprising than killing your main character ?
what about this-- go with me-- what if , um ,
what if my character lives
and the book just goes on ?
imagine coming to the end of the book ,
and then just finding a lot more book .
surprise .
i heard that song yesterday .
this song is everywhere these days .
were you at my house ?
okay , thank you . good @-@ bye .
no .

no ! get off of him !
you kill him , you kill me , too !
get away from my edgar !
my eyes ! oh !
my giant eyes !
you thought i was a murderer ?
you thought i was a murderer of people ?
you said you were gonna kill me , so i don &apos;t know .
your character ... in my graphic novel .
he &apos;s an excellent artist .
okay , but your drawings ,
they don &apos;t have any eyes .
hate drawing eyes . it &apos;s weird .
he can &apos;t draw eyes .
there &apos;s a reason for everything .
what about the duffel bag ?
don &apos;t ask about the duffel bag !
bitch .
whoa , whoa !
whoa ! hey , man .
hey , take this as a compliment , pal .
your stories are so real .
well , it &apos;s because what you taught me .
you listened ?
well , of course i listened . you were a good teacher .
until you thought i was a murderer and you broke into my shed .
aw ! you were my favorite student until
i thought you were a murderer .
ah ... your son &apos;s a really great writer .
he &apos;s not my son .
oh ! are you kidding ? ! really ? !

i don &apos;t want it to stick to the pan .
okay , did you ... ?
great .
it &apos;s just what bacon needs ,
more fat .
and salt .
what &apos;s this ?
don &apos;t read that . i &apos;m not finished ...
&quot; julius pepperwood : zombie detective &quot; ?
all his murder victims are already dead ,
so they obviously don &apos;t need a detective . i &apos;m working on it .
&quot; the night was inky hot . &quot;
don &apos;t do this .
&quot; she strode into his office with a sense of purpose , place ,
another word here , question mark . &quot;
i &apos;m looking for another &quot; p &quot; word there .
&quot; she had zombie legs that went on for miles .
&quot; they were the kind of legs you could sink your teeth into .
&quot; pepperwood had two friends-- one , if you count his hat .
the other was his gal friday , jessica night . &quot;
it &apos;s not you , jess .
&quot; she was small in stature , but not in spunk .
and a super annoying know @-@ it @-@ all . &quot;
good evening .
hello .
oh , bacon .
where the hell did you come from ?
i came from my room .
no , i didn &apos;t hear the pitter- patter of your disgusting feet .
i cut my toenails . yeah , the soaking really worked .
look at that . they &apos;re gorgeous now .
went down a full shoe size .
guys ! fire !
whoa , whoa !
oh , my god !
everybody relax !

you call the fireman !
i &apos;m the fireman .
you can &apos;t put out a grease fire with water !

why don &apos;t you say that before !
i don &apos;t want to be a know @-@ it @-@ all .
yes !
amazing , my man .
honestly , i didn &apos;t know you were gonna put your arm around me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , you put up your pup tent in front of the fire .
it &apos;s involuntary .
it is a combination of adrenaline
and great circulation .
and i &apos;d appreciate it if you don &apos;t just hug me randomly ! that &apos;s weird and ... !
you ever notice ...
when winston runs , that he kinda farts while he &apos;s running ?
yes !
sounds like a jalopy .
new pogo .
oh , we got a great new pogo ! he farts when he runs !
