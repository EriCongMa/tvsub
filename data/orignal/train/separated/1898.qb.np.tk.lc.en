let &apos;s say you &apos;re standing in an o.r. ,
staring at an aneurysm
that &apos;s embedded deep in the patient &apos;s frontal lobe .
there are three things you &apos;ll need to remove it .
zola &apos;s up .
no , she &apos;s still asleep . we &apos;re good .
no , no . she &apos;s up .
did you hear something ?
no .
but you know she &apos;s up ?
yes .
you &apos;ll need confidence ...
you &apos;ll need an 11 @-@ blade ...
and some really good instincts .
come here , you .
no , no .
okay , so then we coax those initial cartilage cells
to multiply--
don &apos;t look at your cards .
so ...
then we coax those initial cartilage cells to multiply .
after 2 months , the--the , uh , original 200,000
have ...
now i &apos;ve lost my place .
relax .
no , i can &apos;t relax , okay ?
i have to do this speech at the ted conference
in less than 48 hours .
the ted conference .

everyone in the audience naked .

articular cartilage .
articular cartilage regeneration
offers new hope for patients ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m , um ... helping .
good morning .

gas tanker slammed into an s.u.v. on the i @-@ 5 .
caused a huge pileup .
no telling how many traumas are coming in . we should ...
get going .
hey . did a giant tanker really flip over ?
where &apos;s wilson ?
with grey . you &apos;ve got me today .
so how big was the accident ?
do you think anyone got impaled ? i ...
wilson ! stop sucking face and check your pager .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t hear my pager .
yeah . it &apos;s hard to hear when you have a tongue in your ear .
dr. wilson .
right ?
um , you saw us the other night .
i &apos;m casey hedges . that my son parker .
right . is he still sick ?
well , his fever was down when i left for my shift .
i &apos;m a waitress . but then my neighbor called .
she said it spiked again , and then when i got home ,
he had this rash .
you &apos;ve been giving him the meds , lots of fluids ?
yeah , but his fever &apos;s still above 103,
and it &apos;s been like that for over a week now .
and i mean , i know that you told me it &apos;s a virus--
probably adenovirus .
the fever can last at least five days with it .
it &apos;s not that unusual .
i @-@ i &apos;ve been tracking the spikes in his fever ,
and i--
i looked up his symptoms online
and wrote down a bunch of stuff .
roseola , shingles , lupus .
i just ...
i can &apos;t explain it , but i know my kid .
this is not a virus . i just ... feel it .
come on .
okay . i &apos;ll go get your chart .
shepherd , what are you doing ?
i got your page . a tanker blew ?
a tanker didn &apos;t blow .
i meant , what are you doing with ross ?
didn &apos;t you get the memo ?
oh , we &apos;re supposed to read those ?
yeah , i need you to start using other interns .
i can &apos;t have attendings playing favorites .
these kids need a well @-@ rounded education .
ross , are you feeling poorly rounded ?
no , sir . i &apos;m very rounded .
see ? he &apos;s very rounded .
hey . i heard about the accident . a tanker blew ?
a tanker didn &apos;t blow .
bailey , i haven &apos;t seen you
outside your genome lab for a week .
oh , speaking of which , when can i have my genome mapped ?
i have an aunt who died of breast cancer .
it can happen in males .
uh , no . yeah , it can .
it &apos;s just , now i &apos;m thinking about your breasts .
when did you say that tanker blew ?
the tanker did not blow .
oh . wh--
don &apos;t look so disappointed .
cam miller , restrained passenger
in a vehicle t @-@ boned on its side .
vital signs stable . g.c.s. is 14 .
he &apos;s been disoriented .
yeah , the tanker &apos;s been leaking gas

but we had to get him outta there .
okay , no open flames ,
no smokers , no use of cauteries .
be safe , people .

we need the space .
this little guy checks out okay .
okay . um , finish bandaging his wrist ,
and then have somebody wait with him--
but ... i thought you said i could see my parents .
so , mr. dawson , there &apos;s a little fluid around your lungs .
i &apos;m a little concerned , so we &apos;re gonna take you up to c.t.

it &apos;s just a little cut that murphy cleaned up .
bad news is , yang has the husband in surgery .
possibly an aortic transection .
speaking of bad news .
ugh . right frontal lobe hemorrhage .
that could be why she was anxiety .
oh , cool , is it a epidural hemorrhage ?
sorry . i &apos;m interrupting .
you guys were having a moment or something .

cord &apos;s prolapsed . we need to secure it .
what is happening ?
your baby &apos;s umbilical cord has dropped ,
and it &apos;s now trapped against her body ,
and that &apos;s why she &apos;s in distress .
ma &apos;am , we need to keep the cord inside
so your baby doesn &apos;t lose any more oxygen .
to do that , i &apos;m gonna have to place my hand inside .
i &apos;m really sorry , but it &apos;s gonna hurt a lot , okay ?
did you call my husband ? where is my husband ?

to take care of you and your baby .
okay ?
matthew ?
matthew ?
oh , hi .
yeah , superman here broke protocol
and ran into the crash to shield a kid from the blast
with his own body .
well , it seemed like the right thing to do at the time .
he could &apos;ve died .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t . i &apos;m fi--ow .
i &apos;m fine .
just go ahead and go .
you got more important patients than me .
go save a life or something .
yeah , go ahead . i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll check him out .
okay . um , i @-@ i will be back as soon as i can .
just--just don &apos;t go crazy
and go into shock or bleed out or something--
april , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
please don &apos;t be surgical . please don &apos;t be surgical .
okay , i &apos;m on it .
oh , it &apos;s surgical .
hey , there you are .
oh , no . me first .
okay , okay . what have we got ? what have we got ?
yeah , a bike messenger caught in the blast .
my patient &apos;s in a lot of pain .
everybody &apos;s patient &apos;s in a lot of pain .
yeah , these are all gonna need surgery .
page dr. garrity .
my plane leaves for--
for ted in four hours .
you &apos;re going to ted ?
lucky . my roommate went last year .
did tequila shots with bill gates .
it &apos;s a fancy people frat party .
oh , you &apos;ll be singing a different tune next year
when you &apos;re there with your genome stuff .
oh , map my genomes .
that sounds like fun .
it &apos;s not a spa treatment . it &apos;s science .
just like building new cartilage
as i say in my speech--
okay , callie . callie . the patients .
no , you &apos;re right .
i should keep it fresh for the conference anyway .
excuse me .
uh , just looking for a status report
for the patient &apos;s kid .
the injury extends into the aortic arch .
so in order to maintain head perfusion ,
i have to bypass in two circuits .
i &apos;m just waiting on russell for a second opinion .
you had to call russell for this ?
not really .
but ever since i became his boss ,
i like to make him think that he &apos;s still mine .
3 @-@ 0 prolene .
so could i give the kid a time frame ?
uh , give me an hour . i &apos;ll know better .
okay .
dr. shepherd , where did you get
&quot; it &apos;s a beautiful day to save lives &quot; ?
is that from a movie ?
no , it &apos;s not from a movie .
are you sure ?
&apos;cause sometimes i think i &apos;m making something up ,
and then i &apos;m watching a detergent commercial ,
and i realize , that &apos;s where i got that from .
brooks , you know how sometimes
people downplay the difficulty of a task
by saying , &quot; it &apos;s not brain surgery &quot; ?
sure .
this is brain surgery .
right .
sorry .
what are you doing ?
he makes me nervous ,
and i just want him to like me .
clearly not the way to do it .
okay , ross , now i have exposed the dura ,
so why don &apos;t you come closer and get a better look ?
he loves you .
i &apos;d been in 20 surgeries
before he ever invited me to his side of the table .
it could take a while , but he &apos;ll warm up to you .
you &apos;ve got some fast hands , brooks .
and the baby &apos;s out .
i noticed you haven &apos;t thanked me yet
for catching your patient &apos;s prolapsed cord .
i was on my way to the e.r.
yeah , taking your own sweet time .
you want to cool it , man ?
you &apos;re being very unprofessional .
okay , let &apos;s begin to explore the abdomen .
oh , god , elyse . she &apos;s losing too much blood .
more lap pads . now !
burn center is full .
i just closed us to new patients . what else ?
social services came for the little boy--
ethan ! no !
whoa . whoa . whoa . where you going ?
i want to see my parents .
sorry . he &apos;s a runner .
honey , we need to go .
no , i don &apos;t want to .
you need sleep .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere !
yes , you are . you &apos;re coming with me . now come .
no . look , he &apos;s worried about his parents .
how about we set you up in a room ,
and you can stay with him there ?
that &apos;s not a permanent solution .
i know , but it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s for one night .
and then we can figure out the rest later .
how does that sound ?
yeah ? sound good ?
okay .
come on . we need to go now .
the baby &apos;s dad just arrived .
myers is bringing him up .
i still don &apos;t know what she sees in that d @-@ bag .
right ? what does she see in that guy ?
he &apos;s so handsome
and friendly ,
charming , nice .
vince , this is dr. karev .
he &apos;s been taking care of your little girl .
look at her . she--she &apos;s perfect .
she &apos;s doing really well . and i spoke to dr. kepner .
your wife is still in surgery . we should have an update soon .
thank you . thank you very much .
your baby &apos;s pretty darn cute .
want to hold her ?
also sensitive .
did i mention , he &apos;s sensitive ?
we went home , but then his fever got higher .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
ma &apos;am , we &apos;ll be with you as soon as we can .
we &apos;re extremely backed up .
yeah , i understand everyone &apos;s very sick ,
but so is my son .
casey , what &apos;s wrong ? what are you doing back here ?
this isn &apos;t strep .
whatever you prescribed him did nothing .
it takes at least 24 hours for antibiotics to start working .
yeah , but then he should be getting better ,
and he &apos;s getting worse .
this isn &apos;t strep .
please just calm down .
calm down ? calm down ? my son is sick .
he &apos;s sick , and you gave him medicine ,
and it &apos;s not working .
and now you just keep dismissing us ,
just like all the other doctors did
at seattle pres and urgent care--
wait . hang on .
you &apos;ve been to both of those places , too , this week ?
yeah , and i &apos;m not gonna let you push me around like they did .
you either don &apos;t care about my son
or you don &apos;t believe me .
either way , you suck , and i want someone else .
find me another doctor !
keep an eye on rachel &apos;s i.c.p.
update me with any changes .
will do . anything else ?
yes , brooks , think fast .
anything else medically ?
a neuro exam every two hours .
contact me immediately if there &apos;s any sign
of herniation or a new hemorrhage .
you got it ?
yes , sir .
good .
dr. shepherd , i &apos;m open .
that was my phone .
i &apos;m sorry you have to stand there for so long ,
dealing with my ass .
ah , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m a plastic surgeon .
it &apos;s not that a big deal to me .
actually , can we not talk while you do that ?
sure . i feel for you , dude .
but i have seen way worse .
okay . i &apos;m gonna come back later .
april--
it &apos;s cool . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m just gonna--
i &apos;m gonna leave now . yep . now .
like that .
that was worse .
he &apos;s cranky , he &apos;s not sleeping well ,
and then he &apos;s got these really chapped lips ,
and then today it was this weird rash .
a @-@ and--and how-- how are you doing ?
are you getting enough sleep ?
no , of course not . i told you , he &apos;s up all night .
and it &apos;s just you , no husband ,
no boyfriend , or partner ?
it &apos;s just me .
well , that &apos;s a lot of pressure on you .
are you a psychiatrist ?
casey ,
just listen--
oh , my god . you are .
you think i &apos;m crazy .
you think i @-@ i skip work
and i drag my kid to the e.r. because it &apos;s fun ,
because--because i enjoy this ?
my son is sick , okay ? he is sick .
he used to wake me up every morning at dawn
by jumping on my bed .
now i can barely get him up .
he does this thing before school--
i let him run out and get the newspaper--
it &apos;s his big @-@ kid chore . he loves it .
he hasn &apos;t done it in a week and a half .
i show him cartoons , and he doesn &apos;t care .
i try to get him to eat ...
i mean , i even gave him potato chips for breakfast once ,
and ... nothing .
i know ...
that i am not a doctor , but you have to believe me .
you have to . you have to .
hey . hey , hey , hey .
i believe you .
we &apos;re gonna take care of your son .
admit him .
i believe you .
yes , i alerted security .
of course . i looked all over .
where &apos;s ethan ?
hang on . i don &apos;t know .
i went to the restroom . when i came back , he was gone .
when ?
i told you , he &apos;s a runner .
when did you lose him ?
about a half @-@ hour ago .
no , shepherd still hates me .
now he just makes me do tricks .
it takes more than just good instincts with shepherd .
you have to be prepared , diligent--
says his star pupil . i &apos;m his circus act .
wait .
mom .
hang on , buddy .
mom .
what are you doing ?
who are you ? what-- what are you doing ?
why don &apos;t we go outside , okay ?
it &apos;s me , mom . ethan .
it &apos;s okay , ma &apos;am . it &apos;s your son .
no , it &apos;s not . who is he ? who is that ? !
who are you ? !
help me ! what &apos;s happening ? !
who is this ? what &apos;s happening to me ?
help me ! help me , please !
so you &apos;re in the semifinals , huh ?
what position do you play ?
coach stuck me at left defender .
hey , left defender ... is crucial .
i guess .
so ...
why doesn &apos;t she know who i am ?
ethan , your mom hurt her head pretty bad .
and sometimes that can make people act really weird ,
even with the people that they love .
so she &apos;s gonna remember me ?
i think so .
e @-@ ethan , i , um ...
i need you to stay with the social worker .
the lady ?
mm @-@ hmm .
can i stay with you ?
no , no . no , i have to--i have to work .
i have to help your mom and dad get better ,
and they &apos;re--they &apos;re gonna get better quicker
if they know that you &apos;re somewhere safe .
so can you help me out with that ?
you done ?
and i &apos;m telling you ...
the guys bring the ball down the wings ,
left defender can save the game .
she has a new hematoma in the temporal lobe .
now why would that cause her not to recognize her son ?
uh , the hematoma could be putting pressure
on the white matter tracts ,
causing her to experience symptoms of capgras syndrome .
good . and what would your plan of action be ?
relieve the pressure with evacuation of the hematoma .
what about watching her coags
and correcting her i.c.p. with mannitol
and aggressive i.c.p. drainage ?
that &apos;s a good thought , brooks ,
but in this case , i think ross is right .
uh , find an o.r. that &apos;s available . okay ?
oh , brooks .
you never miss , do you ?
star pupil .
circus act .
his cat scan is completely normal .
i know this must be so annoying for you .
i mean , i know i know nothing ,
but i did all this research--
no , not at all . let &apos;s go through it .
please . um ...
what &apos;s first ?
okay , are you sure that it &apos;s not lupus ?
he doesn &apos;t fit the criteria ,
and the rash is quite different .
what else ?
what about , uh , ent @-@ enterovirus
or , um , meningitis ?
well , i can see why you would think that .
but again , the rash associated with enterovirus
is commonly distributed over the hands and the feet .
and , uh , we ruled out meningitis
when his spinal tap came back clear .
okay . um ...
i read this one article about something called kawasaki disease .
they said it can cause a heart attack .
that &apos;s a good one .
it would explain the fever and the rash .
but there would be other symptoms--
the strawberry tongue ,
and peeling skin and red eyes ,
and--and no positive strep .
dr. grey ... what do you think this is ?
i @-@ i think it &apos;s strep .
yeah , but then he would be getting better .
i &apos;m sorry . i know that you &apos;re a surgeon .
you don &apos;t even normally handle cases like this .
no , it &apos;s , uh ...
i own the hospital , and i can do whatever i want .
i want to do some more tests .
you and me , elyse , we &apos;re a team .
ever since professor sheldon
paired us up in that stupid poli @-@ sci class .
i don &apos;t work without you .
so you can &apos;t leave me or us .
we &apos;re supposed to be together .
elyse likes the name rose for the baby .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s beautiful .
okay , honey .
rosie it is .
i &apos;m gonna go down and see her .
i love you .
i &apos;m just gonna check on her burns .
how &apos;s she doing ?
not well .
she &apos;s acidotic , and her creatinine &apos;s sky @-@ high .
you know , they dated in college .
but then her dad died ,
so she had to leave school , and they lost touch
till about three years ago ,
when they both randomly decided to move
from wisconsin to seattle
and joined the same bowling league .
how weird is that ?
that people join bowling leagues ?
the universe kept pulling them together , just ...
waiting for them to see that they were meant to be together ,
and then ...
and then a tanker explodes ,
and she ends up in the hospital .
yeah .
your paramedic is gonna be fine , by the way .
ooh , bailey .
you have to map me .
i need to know which parent i take after .
my dad eats three salads a day and has high cholesterol .
my mother , bunions .
if torres gets mapped , i get mapped .
hey , my genome sequencer is not a toy .
it is an expensive and complex piece of equipment ,
to be used for people with serious conditions .
oh , like this guy ?
&apos;cause you should really map his genome ,
look for the idiot gene .
he managed to snap his elbow
after lighting himself on fire
when he wanted a smoke while covered in gasoline .
callie , i asked for an ortho consult ,
and they sent me to you .
weren &apos;t you supposed to leave hours ago ?
i was , but then ... baked alaska .
i &apos;m so sorry .
well , hey , look at it this way .
now you have time to spice up your speech for next year .
and i still need an ortho consult
in o.r. three when you &apos;re done .
spice-- spice up ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
uh ... you did , though .
no , no . i &apos;m just saying that these--
these talks are never about
what they &apos;re ... about .
i @-@ i heard one about floating algae pods ,
and then it ended up reminding me
to live every day to the fullest .
it was very inspiring .
yeah . yeah , and yours is just about , you know ...
cartilage right now .
but no one sells cartilage like you .
and it is-- it &apos;s a great speech .
you know , this invitation
was the one uncomplicated good thing
that &apos;s happened in a while ,
the one thing i was really looking forward to .
yeah , and i &apos;m telling you that it &apos;s great .
no . you &apos;re telling me it &apos;s not ...
finally .
and it helps .
i feel better about not going .
i &apos;ll see you in o.r. three .
so any idea when the kid &apos;s dad
is gonna get transferred out of the c.c.u. ?
he &apos;s pretty freaked out right now .
no , no idea .
he &apos;s stable , but his hemoglobin is still low .
that aortic repair took a lot longer than i thought .
oh , i have to be back on rounds ...
in 29 minutes .
should i sleep or should i shower ?
i could sleep in the shower .
oh , but i &apos;m also starving . have you eaten ?
shoot .
his pressure dropped out and he went into cardiac arrest .
hold c.p.r.
pulse is v @-@ tach . paddles . charge to 200 .
what happened ?
i was doing my exam ,
and she started bleeding from her incisions and her i.v. sites ,
and then she dropped into v @-@ fib .
we just shocked her once .
i &apos;ll take over . charge to 150 .
push another epi .
clear .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
come on . give me 200 .
clear !
got him . got him .
clear !
come on , elyse !
push 5 of epi .
april .
epi now !
april , we lost her .
okay ?
i don &apos;t know why this one
is hitting me so hard .
it &apos;s not supposed to happen this way .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not right .
i can &apos;t tell him . i can &apos;t tell him .
i , uh , and i can &apos;t make him feel worse
just &apos; cause i feel bad .
i--i &apos;ll do it .
no , no .
i &apos;ll do it . i can do it .
i just ...
i need a minute .
okay .
i was , uh , coming to give the mom an update on her baby--
elyse cruse .
yeah , she didn &apos;t , um ... she didn &apos;t make it .
we were gonna go tell the husband now .
no , i was . i was . i @-@ i will .
i just--i need ...
i just have to pull myself together .
chest peckwell &apos;s name &apos;s on the file .
you want me to make him do it ?
more ice .
could it be munchausen by proxy ?
what , that she &apos;s making her own kid sick ?
no . she just has a strong feeling
that it &apos;s something more than strep .
or she &apos;s crazy .
what &apos;s his core temp ?
still 93 .
i mean , it &apos;s strep , right ?
if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck--
mer , the duck &apos;s strep test positive .
what happened ?
he had an m.l. he coded .
why didn &apos;t you wake me ?
why would i ? he &apos;s my patient ?
so what are you doing ?
uh , therapeutic hypothermia , just 24 hours .
i &apos;m cooling his body so he &apos;ll avoid another attack .
but--but he just had surgery .
this could increase his risk of infection and bleeding .
or it could save his life .
did russell agree to this ?
you know , i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t ask him .
&apos;cause he &apos;s my patient .
i think he &apos;s gonna tell your teacher .
okay , ross .
open up the bone flap .
yes , sir . you got it .
good .
okay . a little bit more .
good .
thank you , sir .
brooks , why don &apos;t you step up
and help me excise the dura ?
really ?
yeah . switch with ross .
okay , so when i cut , i want you to
coagulate the bleeders with the bipolar .
exactly .
god , you have fast hands , brooks .
i &apos;m so sorry , casey .
but i @-@ i can &apos;t find anything wrong with parker
other than the strep .
so you &apos;re gonna discharge him ?
i can &apos;t find a reason to keep him here .
it &apos;s not surgical ,
his labs keep coming back clean .
i know i keep saying this , and i know it &apos;s crazy .
i mean , i can hear myself sounding crazy ...
but this feeling won &apos;t go away ,
this feeling that there is something wrong with him .
and i know you &apos;re telling me
that there &apos;s nothing wrong with him
and that i should believe you because you &apos;re a doctor
and i &apos;m just a waitress .
but how do i ignore this ?
how do ignore my gut
telling me that there is
something seriously wrong with my son ?
hey , you seen super douche around ?
peckwell ?
jason ?
ah , conference room .
myers .
oh , grey &apos;s paging me . i &apos;ll catch you later .
vince cruse &apos;s wife didn &apos;t make it .
i figure the news might come better from you .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s not my patient anymore .
i passed her off to kepner .
okay , but his wife was your patient when she first came in .
the guy knows you . he trusts you .
dude , i &apos;m sorry , but she is not my responsibility .
you &apos;re a douche .
no , you &apos;re a douche .
you don &apos;t have a problem with how i do my job .
you have a problem with who i &apos;m dating .
you &apos;re really not coming with me to talk to him ?
what do you think ?
guess i &apos;ll be doing your job again .
you paged me ?
oh , we &apos;re discharging parker ?
yes , i have it all ready to go ,
but i just need you to go through it with me all
one more time .
okay .
latest white count ?
18 .
platelet count ?
500,000 .
high fever . unresponsive to meds .
it &apos;s gotta just be a weird presentation of strep , right ?
actually , hang on . the labs were just updated .
yesterday &apos;s rapid test was a false positive .
the strep culture &apos;s negative .
who are you calling ?
no one . i &apos;m checking my calendar .
what day did his fever start ?
wednesday , i think .
damn . we &apos;re already at day ten .
what &apos;s day ten ?
did parker have red eyes ?
uh , he was asleep the last time i checked on him .
let &apos;s go .
oh . is everything okay ?
we need to check parker &apos;s eyes .
what--what &apos;s going on ? y @-@ you &apos;re scaring me .
page peds , page cardio ,
start an i.v.i.g. right away .
we &apos;re already on day ten .
what ? what is happening ?
casey , if we &apos;re right ,
this could be kawasaki disease .
but we need to get this i.v. started on parker right away .
we &apos;re still within the window
to prevent permanent heart damage ,
but we have to do it right now .
oh , no .
no . no .
casey , hey .
you okay ?
so this is parker &apos;s echo .
that right there is the fluid around his heart .
the i.v.i.g. will fix that .
he &apos;s gonna need another echo in six months .
and ... do you remember this ?
parker has kawasaki disease .
you fought for your son .
you didn &apos;t give up .
you saved his life today .
you were right .
i was right ?
you were right .
dr. shepherd ,
i &apos;ve run a full post @-@ op exam on rachel .
i &apos;m gonna monitor her for the next four hours ,
but don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll still be here early tomorrow morning
to prep for mr. yoshida &apos;s craniotomy .
yeah , ross , about that . hunt &apos;s right .
everybody needs a shot at neuro ,
and you need a chance to see other specialties ,
so brooks is gonna be on my service
for the rest of the week .
i &apos;ll see you when it &apos;s your turn again .
arizona , i just want to go home .
i just want to curl up in a ball , do ...
what--what the hell ? what is this ?
your ted speech .
sit .
what ? how ? how ?
i made a call .
we set up a video stream to the conference .
you &apos;re going on live .
oh ! i don &apos;t have my notes .
oh , yes , yes . yes , you do .
even though i know you know it by heart .
i mean , i know it by heart . just start talking .
okay , it &apos;s almost time .
but--but i-- it &apos;s a terrible speech .
it &apos;s a great speech .
i &apos;m not ...
five , four , three ...
coming to you live from grey sloan memorial hospital
in seattle-- dr. calliope torres .
just talk . just be who you are .
i &apos;m dr. callie torres .
and ...
i &apos;ve had a pretty bad year .
i was almost killed in a car wreck ,
then i ... nearly lost my wife in an accident
that claimed the life of my best friend
and the father of my child ,
and ... some other stuff .
i &apos;m an orthopedic surgeon by trade
and i work with cartilage ,
so i &apos;ve spent a lot of time thinking about
what holds us together
when things fall apart .
i &apos;m so sorry i haven &apos;t been to visit you more today .
are you okay ?
do you ...
do you believe that god plans
for two people to be together ?
yeah , i do .
my patient died ,
her husband is left with their new baby .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
it just-- it doesn &apos;t--
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would he bring these two people together ,
make them fall in love , o @-@ open up to one another ,
make them feel like they were meant to be together ,
and then just ... pull them apart ?
april ...
i get it .
i @-@ i know today scared you , but i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine .
i promise you , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
and i love you , too .
come here .
i talked to russell ,
and he agrees with your course of hypothermia ,
although he may only be agreeing
because he &apos;s afraid of you .
like you said ...
you &apos;re his boss now .
yeah , what &apos;s going on ?
this guy has a little boy , cristina ,
who is scared to death that both of his parents--
oh , my god . a little boy ? why didn &apos;t you say that ?
i would &apos;ve rethought everything .
i would &apos;ve actually tried to save the man .
cristina--
do you think that i would make a decision
that is not in the best interest of my patient ?
i just want this kid to see his dad again .
i do , too .
i know .
i know .
it &apos;s been a hell of a day .
yeah , let &apos;s get outta here .
yeah . um , i gotta wrap up a few things first .
okay , sure .
there are some feelings that refuse to go away .
they &apos;re little distractions whispering in your ear .
thank you for not being a douche .
you &apos;re welcome .
where &apos;s wilson ?
probably with assface .
beer , please .
you got it .
i know what you &apos;re doing ,
and apparently you think i &apos;m too nice
to do anything about it ...
but you &apos;re wrong .
so you can try to snake neuro out from under me ,
but just so we &apos;re clear ,
i &apos;m not going down without a fight .
i &apos;m not--
save it .
some things just get under your skin .
so ... she &apos;s sleeping ?
she made it through the day , just like your dad .
they both have a lot of good doctors taking care of them .
and ... i can see them tomorrow ?
yeah .
but right now--
right now we need to get you back to your room
so you can get some sleep , all right ?
hey , you know , i @-@ i played some left defender myself .
so you played soccer ?
mm . i did .
did you score any goals ?
look , mommy . i made this for you .
buddy .
try as you might ...
thank you .
you can &apos;t ignore your instincts .
hi , dr. bailey .
what do you need , grey ?
oh , genetically , i don &apos;t know anything about zola .
and i want to be able to fight for my kid ,
i want you to map her .
and if i &apos;m gonna have to fight for her ,
i am gonna need to know if i &apos;m gonna be around to do it .
so i want you to map me , too .
i want to know if i &apos;m gonna get alzheimer &apos;s .
it &apos;s like they say ...
