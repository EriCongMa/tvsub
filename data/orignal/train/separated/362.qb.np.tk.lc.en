this cream is a miracle .
my fine lines and sagging skin are gone .
i look like a different person .
hey ! bro !
thanks for the referral .
painting the smith house today .
hey , it &apos;s me .
heads up .
someone &apos;s got eyes on us .
i need to come in .
synalock . may i help you ?
he &apos;s on a conference call , but he should be off in a few minutes .
mr. werner &apos;s not available . can i have him return ?
thank you .
what ?
you changed your hair .
no . not really .
hey . just give me a second .
what do i have this morning ?
ok , move london to 12 : 30
and reschedule lunch with caldwell .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
don &apos;t shoot !
it &apos;s today ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve got a big meeting .
fine . put her on .
hi , sweetheart .
i know .
ok . well , mom &apos;s gonna record the pageant .
i know . i wish i could be there , too .
ok . break a leg , honey .
hey , good morning .
oh , look at you spoiling me . thank you .
where &apos;s yours ?
oh , i quit caffeine .
trying to relax more .
well , don &apos;t relax too much .
you got 10 hours of takedown
and arrest procedure training to recertify .
since when ?
since the hearing .
am i the only one ?
prentiss , you &apos;ve been away .
oh , yeah . i guess i can &apos;t complain .
well , especially not to your trainer .
oh ! you &apos;re doing it ?
don &apos;t get too excited . i &apos;m about to put you
through the wringer . you can believe that .
workplace massacre this morning
at synalock incorporated .
that &apos;s in charlottesville ,
which is practically our own backyard .
that &apos;s a high body count .
yeah , 8 victims in total .
all employees , including the ceo .
5 were shot , 3 were stabbed to death .
a gun and a knife . that &apos;s highly unusual .
it could be two killers .
that would be the first time for a workplace killing .
their business is internet security for corporations .
they didn &apos;t have video surveillance ?
they just moved into a new building .
they didn &apos;t have time to set up their system yet .
how is it no one heard or saw anything ?
this killer was prepared .
highly organized . this was premeditated .
he kept his emotions contained .
pretty hard to do for the typical workplace killer
who &apos;s mentally ill or outraged about some perceived injustice .
the high body count indicates a hell of a lot of rage .
one employee , john owen , was mia .
local p.d. haven &apos;t been able to locate him yet .
any unhappy clients ?
or a domestic situation among the employees ?
don &apos;t know , but your friendly neighborhood genius girl
will find out .
bottom line is a mass killing
is a classic show of force .
it &apos;s a way to become known .
which is why suicide , often by cop , is usually part of the plan .
so where &apos;s the unsub ?
he has a reason to stay hidden .
he &apos;s not finished yet .
&quot; men are not prisoners of fate ,
but prisoners of their own minds . &quot;
franklin d. roosevelt .
agent hotchner ? i &apos;m trooper long
from the bureau of crime investigation .
appreciate you coming so quickly .
absolutely . these are agents rossi and jareau and dr . reid .
so a fed ex carrier called it in ?
at 8 : 03 , on his early route .
no one expect to go to work and never come home ,
but today at synalock ,
a new company providing internet security ...
after the news broke , half the town called in sick .
understandable .
the media &apos;s in a frenzy .
a press briefing from you guys would calm them down .
of course . as soon as we make our assessment .
so what do we know about the missing employee so far ?
apparently he &apos;s a programmer .
we have an unconfirmed report
of a neighbor seeing his car near his home this morning .
you said the ceo &apos;s office was ransacked ?
yes . adam werner &apos;s office .
jj .
this is the first victim we found ,
nathan munz .
the position of the body suggests
he was one of the last ones killed .
he tried to escape and almost made it to the exit .
jane burney and winia dev were here .
jane tried to run , vinia didn &apos;t .
how do you know ?
she &apos;s half under her desk ,
which means she tried to hide and the unsub found her .
so these 3 were stabbed and the rest were shot to death .
have you considered two killers ?
yes , but the bloody footprints
all seem to come from the same pair of shoes .
given the violence , if there were a second killer ,
he &apos;d be hard @-@ pressed to get away without leaving tracks .
if there was only one unsub ,
he used his gun first , emptied his magazine ,
didn &apos;t have a replacement , and resorted to using his knife .
he &apos;d have to be physically fight or at least intimidating enough
to subdue so many people .
if this were highly premeditated ,
he would have brought enough ammunition to kill everyone .
unless he had a single target .
he killed the rest of them because they were witnesses .
we need to figure out who his first victim was .
these are contracts synalock had .
what was the unsub looking for ?
maybe he was a client searching for his own contract
to hide any connection to synalock after the murders .
ah , everything &apos;s digital these days ,
though . the hard copy &apos;s just a backup .
so the unsub &apos;s looking for an object , an old record ,
something not on a computer .
huh . rossi , check this out .
so , uh , werner was worried enough about his safety to be armed .
and he didn &apos;t have time to go for his gun
or didn &apos;t perceive the threat to be immediate .
or keeping a gun around was out of force of habit .
he was a veteran .
a naval officer by the looks of it .
a decorated one at that .
he was awarded the navy cross in 2000 .
something else used to be here .
another picture frame .
blood splatter overlay patterns
indicate victim number 3 was over here .
victim number 2 right here .
and finally victim number one right here .
adam werner was killed first ?
looks that way .
which means the unsub made
it all the way in here without alarming anyone .
he wasn &apos;t threatening .
that &apos;s why werner didn &apos;t pull the gun we found in his office .
he could have been the missing employee .
he may have taken that photo from his office if he was in it .
why would an employee
be interested in synalock &apos;s contracts ?
maybe this is about one client .
he could be after specific company information .
he had another motive besides killing .
hello .
dad , it &apos;s me .
hey , luke . your mother and i were just talking about you .
dad , listen to me . has anyone called you ,
asked you any questions ?
about what ?
about me .
no . what &apos;s this about ?
there &apos;s a situation .
what sort of situation ?
i &apos;ll tell you about it when i see you .
in the meantime , don &apos;t answer your phone or your door , ok ?
why ?
i &apos;m on my way there now .
you &apos;ve reached jenna . leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s luke .
uh , look , i know you don &apos;t want to hear from me .
but something &apos;s come up and i need to know
that you and ally are safe , ok ?
call me . bye .
it was clean and fast .
he sliced through the left carotid and abdominal aorta ,
major arteries that would bleed out quickly .
killed with an economy of motion .
yes . and all 3 stab victims had similar wounds .
what about the shooting victims ?
they all took two .45s to the chest ,
except for adam werner .
he took 4 body shots and one to the head ,
execution style .
definite overkill .
somebody was angry with the boss .
somebody with hunting skills .
or a law enforcement background ?
thank you .
mom ? dad ?
hey , luke .
there you are . mother &apos;s upstairs .
she was worried that something happened .
it &apos;s good to see you , buddy .
dad ?
what have you done to my father ?
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m right here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
is this about the mission ?
what mission ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
what have you done to my father ?
talk to me , little genie .
well , since you know how to rub my lamp ,
your wish is my command .
i checked the synalock client list ,
and the defense intelligence agency is new to them ,
so there really isn &apos;t anything to report ,
and everyone else is crazy happy with their service .
no complaints logged online ?
zero . i &apos;m talking every high @-@ tech blog ,
every chat room , glowing accolades .
no one had anything contrary to say about synalock .
any employees have a history of domestic disturbances or stalkers ?
not that i &apos;d violate privacy laws to check , she says ,
but the answer is no .
so synalock is clean .
mm @-@ hmm . as a whistle .
which reminds me ...
you know how to whistle , don &apos;t you ?
you just put your lips together
and blow .
i love it when you talk old movies . later , baby girl .
with all the overkill on werner ,
there &apos;s got to be a personal connection .
we &apos;ve located john owen , the missing employee .
he &apos;s been at a doctor who convention in san diego since saturday .
it was a scheduled vacation .
lucky guy .
i &apos;ll say . that &apos;s supposed to be an awesome convention .
so if it wasn &apos;t someone connected to the workplace , who is it ?
you know , given the precision of the kills ,
it could be someone with a military background .
or a professional hired by a business competitor .
a hit man would just kill werner .
killing the entire office seems unprofessional .
werner was a navy veteran .
he had d.i.a. contracts . he had close ties to the military .
it could be someone from his past harboring an old grudge .
trooper , issue a be on the lookout to law enforcement
for a physically fit male in his 30s to 40s , possibly a veteran .
he appears nonthreatening and blends in easily .
he &apos;s armed and extremely dangerous .
he most likely will kill again ,
either himself or others , very soon .
what do you know about dorado falls ?
nothing . is this because of jenna ?
what did you do to jenna ?
luke , please , stop this , i &apos;m begging you ,
your mother , her heart is weak .
whatever &apos;s wrong , we &apos;ll help you .
this is your last chance .
you tell me where mark and mary dolan are .
i &apos;m mark dolan . i &apos;m your father .
for the love of god ! please , luke ,
we &apos;re your parents .
luke ...
luke , please ! for the love of god , please .
please , luke ! i &apos;m mark dolan ! i &apos;m your father !
for god &apos;s sake !
are we sure the unsub is their son ?
luke dolan called synalock early this morning .
garcia confirmed it .
know many 60 @-@ year @-@ olds with a boom box ?
trying to mask the sound of the gunshots ?
could be . or he was torturing them with sound .
why were they bound and gagged in the closet ?
why not just kill them right away ?
maybe he was trying to get information from them .
about what ?
go ahead , garcia , you &apos;re on speaker .
ok , luke dolan was in the same navy unit
as our ceo adam werner . that would be the 212th .
they were both communication clerks at camp patriot in kuwait .
i &apos;m sending all this information to your emails now .
any other family ?
he has a wife , jenna . they &apos;ve been separated for years .
she lives in bethesda with her 8 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
we need to bring her for protective custody and to interview her .
send local p.d. and have our nearest unit meet them .
done and done .
ok , it looks like he served 13 years ,
honorable discharge in 2005 .
and now a vp of a biotech company .
he was never a synalock employee .
so , what happened to this guy ?
he was separated from his wife about a year ago ,
but that &apos;s a bit far back to be a trigger .
well , he &apos;s unstable .
he &apos;s on a rampage of some kind .
what if mentally he was reliving a combat situation ?
it could be post @-@ traumatic stress .
everybody could look like an enemy .
prentiss , this was a close @-@ knit family .
look at them . they couldn &apos;t have been more proud of their son .
how bad would his disorder have to be
to make him kill his own parents ?
post @-@ traumatic stress disorder rarely turns people into killers ,
but soldiers with ptsd
have been known to strangle their wives in bed
while having flashbacks or nightmares ,
believing they &apos;re on the battlefield .
in 2005 , an iraqi war vet assaulted two people in las vegas ,
believing them to be enemy combatants .
so dolan &apos;s having a sustained flashback .
pathological disassociation
is one of the markers of complex ptsd ,
although dolan has been stateside for 6 years .
an escalation of the symptoms is possible ,
but it would be rare for them to appear out of nowhere .
well , he seems to have made a successful transition to civilian life .
well , at least on paper it does .
we should find out if he &apos;s had any symptoms since he left the navy .
it could have been the catalyst for the separation .
i &apos;ll have garcia check his records .
hotch , dolan &apos;s been going through this .
look , old mementos and journals from his days in the service .
he didn &apos;t come here just to kill his parents .
he came to get something .
he &apos;s on some sort of mission .
the car &apos;s washed , spotless inside ,
there &apos;s no paint separation or rust .
this accident was recent .
i agree .
the navy &apos;s in his blood .
he would never let that go without getting it fixed immediately .
it might have triggered his condition .
i &apos;ll have garcia run the plates , check for any recent accidents .
so , dolan left his sedan and didn &apos;t take the parents &apos; car .
he was smart enough to know it &apos;d be tracked .
he &apos;s either on foot or he &apos;s stolen another vehicle .
if he &apos;s capable of doing this ,
he &apos;s rational and clear @-@ thinking enough
to evade his perceived enemies .
so despite any mental incapacity ,
he &apos;s still performing at a high level .
just got word from the local pd at the wife and daughters &apos; house .
dolan &apos;s unpredictable when he &apos;s on a rampage .
we need to go wide . we need to get the profile to the press .
luke dolan is a navy veteran
we believe is suffering from ptsd .
a recent trauma may have triggered this .
he is experiencing pathological disassociation
and may believe he &apos;s in a combat situation .
what this means is , to him ,
everyone is a potential enemy .
do not underestimate him .
despite his mental state , he has extreme survival skills .
right now , we believe he &apos;s within a 250 @-@ mile radius of roanoke .
he is armed and extremely dangerous .
it is important that you do not approach this man .
he believes that he is on a mission ,
and if threatened , he will kill .
so if you see him , stay away
and notify the authorities .
sir . sir !
all units , suspect is a navey veteran ...
sir , excuse me . sir , i need you to stop right there .
14 , what &apos;s your status ?
this is 14 , shutting down linley road now .
sir , this road &apos;s closed . you &apos;ll have to turn around .
what &apos;s going on , officer ?
official police matter , sir .
one thing that &apos;s been bothering me
is the first victim , adam werner ,
was given the navy cross in 2000 .
we weren &apos;t at war .
exactly .
you have to show extreme sacrifice ,
risk life and limb to win the second @-@ highest medal of valor .
so what did he do during peacetime to deserve it ?
sir , garcia discovered part
of dolan &apos;s military records were encrypted .
i just got the complete file from the pentagon .
he wasn &apos;t a clerk . he was a navy seal .
let me guess . adam werner was , too .
yeah . werner was the seal team leader , dolan was his number 2 .
their unit was part of jsoc .
they were involved in over 20 highly classified missions .
which missions were in 2000 ?
uh , only one .
operation dorado falls .
see what you can find out about it .
will do .
definitely . that changes the profile .
how so ?
navy seals are screened carefully for vulnerability to ptsd .
they &apos;re resistant to it .
so why would a trained navy seal kill his commanding officer
and his own parents ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s gonna be a lot harder to find him .
very few people on this planet are capable of stopping him .
luke dolan just evaded a roadblock near his wife &apos;s house .
they searched the surrounding area . there &apos;s no sign of him .
did you notice any recent changes in luke &apos;s behavior ?
i saw him friday afternoon when he dropped ally off . he was fine .
did he ever mention dorado falls ?
no . what is that ?
a mission he was on .
he didn &apos;t share that part of his life with me .
luke was always very good at compartmentalizing .
is that why you two separated ?
he &apos;s a good man and a wonderful father ,
but i always felt he was more married to the navy than me .
you weren &apos;t a priority to him ?
somebody once told me all navy seals had a bolt hole ,
a secret location outside the country
where they had another identity and bank account set up .
and i asked luke about it once and he didn &apos;t deny it .
the fact of the matter is , he was ready to leave in an instant .
he had an exit strategy .
yeah . that didn &apos;t include us .
is daddy gonna be ok ?
oh , honey , come here .
ok , so it turns out 6 : 20 friday night
dolan got in a car accident in bethesda .
that must have been after he dropped off his daughter .
he suffered minor injuries , he refused medical treatment .
well , his wife said he was fine when he left her .
what was his mental state after the accident ?
normal . field sobriety test came up negative .
that wouldn &apos;t rule out drug use .
i &apos;d consider schizophrenia ,
except he &apos;s the wrong age for the first psychotic break .
it could be an aneurysm or a brain tumor .
well , one thing &apos;s for sure . he &apos;s having a mental breakdown ,
but what are the specific features of it ?
he &apos;s not living in a past time and place ,
he &apos;s living in the present ,
with the capacity and intelligence to evade law enforcement .
honey , grab me a soda , will you ?
honey , the movie &apos;s starting . you &apos;re missing robert mitchum .
you want her to live ? tell me where my family is .
he took my husband . boyd was bleeding and he dragged him out .
mrs. milgram--
is someone from the army helping ?
ma &apos;am , listen to me . the
fbi is in charge of looking for your husband ,
but i need you to try to remember what luke dolan said .
i can &apos;t . it was gibberish .
yes , you can . just close your eyes .
i can &apos;t .
ma &apos;am , i believe that you can .
just listen to the sound of my voice and you &apos;ll be fine .
just try . close your eyes .
there you go .
just relax and breathe .
very good .
now , what were you doing
before he broke into your house ?
i was in the kitchen . i was pouring a drink for my husband .
he takes me to the living room and ties me up .
what does he say ?
where are my real parents ?
he asks where his real parents are .
how the hell should i know ? i don &apos;t even know you .
don &apos;t play dumb . you replaced them .
does he think your husband did something to them ?
he says , &quot; you replaced them . &quot;
the replacements are dead .
does he mention dorado falls ?
yes .
this is about dorado falls , isn &apos;t it ?
and gaslighting .
dorado falls ?
you &apos;re gaslighting me &apos; cause of the mission .
the mission ? who &apos;s your commanding officer ?
you won &apos;t get away with this .
where are you keeping jenna and ally ?
where &apos;s my family ?
he was calm until he asked about his family .
then he hits boyd with the gun .
all of the milgrams &apos; cars are still here ,
so he must have taken the general in whatever vehicle he came in .
he talked about gaslighting .
he thinks someone &apos;s trying to purposely distort his reality .
he said his parents had been replaced .
he just sounds delusional .
you know , he might have capgras syndrome .
it &apos;s a delusional disorder in
which one believes that their friends and loved ones
have been replaced by imposters .
sort of like &quot; invasion of the body snatchers . &quot;
it typically involves only one sense , such as sight .
basically , the neural connection between the visual cortex
and the emotional center of the brain becomes severed ,
so that looking at a loved one doesn &apos;t elicit
the same emotional response one would expect .
so you think they &apos;re an imposter .
and the interesting thing
is that the auditory connection remains intact ,
so that if they were to hear a loved one speak and not see them ,
they &apos;d think that they were real .
what causes this syndrome ?
it &apos;s unknown in 60 % of the cases ,
but the rest have an organic cause ,
such as tumor or head trauma .
he was in a car accident friday .
people with delusional disorders
don &apos;t all become killers , though .
true , but dolan &apos;s background as a navy seal ,
his knowledge of secret missions , plus capgras syndrome ,
could result in extreme paranoia . it &apos;s the perfect storm .
is there a cure for this ?
unfortunately , no .
although medications have helped in a few cases .
so this guy &apos;s stuck with it .
he &apos;s not killing for the thrill of it ,
he does it because he believes he has no other choice .
he murdered his best friend and his parents
because he believed they were imposters .
so if he were to see his wife and daughter ,
the results would be deadly .
dolan kidnapped the general and didn &apos;t kill his wife
because he had never met them before .
there might be another reason .
he wants contact .
i don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;re gonna gain by your actions ,
but i do know this-- you swore an oath to defend this country
and behave with moral rectitude .
were you thinking of morals
when you gave the go @-@ ahead on dorado falls ?
i told you , that wasn &apos;t me .
you &apos;re a liar .
this country &apos;s at war , and dorado falls
is nothing but a speck on the radar .
no one even remembers .
i remember .
what are you gonna do with me ?
i &apos;ll trade you for my wife and child .
and if that doesn &apos;t work ?
i &apos;ll kill you .
you &apos;re not a navy seal , you &apos;re a disgrace--
国防情报局
how close are you to getting dolan ?
our primary goal right now is the safe recovery of the general .
this is highly classified information , agent jareau .
can &apos;t the bau do this on their own ?
we could . but your help would speed things up .
you &apos;re smart enough to see the upside , i &apos;m sure .
you help and it goes well , you get your ticket punched .
you don &apos;t and it goes south , well ,
the weather &apos;s not too bad outside the beltway .
it &apos;s all in there .
you know why dolan &apos;s so worried about this mission ?
i have no idea .
were there complications ?
every mission has complications .
but there &apos;s no blowback on this one , i can assure you of that .
ok .
it just--i can &apos;t understand
why luke would do all these awful things .
what &apos;s happening to him ?
we think his car accident
triggered a delusional disorder .
oh , my god .
we need to know who luke was closest to .
his father .
hello .
is this lieutenant luke dolan ?
who is this ?
sergeant major david rossi ,
united states marine corps , retired .
who told you to call me ?
i volunteered to call you .
i knew your dad , mark .
we were in boot camp together at parris island .
he &apos;s a good man .
still triangulating a location . hold on .
hold on .
now , we can talk ,
but first i need to know that general milgram is safe .
he &apos;s alive , if that &apos;s what you mean .
what &apos;s up with the music ?
i have no idea .
why did you kidnap the general ?
for leverage to get my family back .
do you think we &apos;re holding them ?
i saw you take my wife and child .
what have you got , garcia ?
getting closer .
we &apos;re in the warehouse district . stand by .
please , stand by .
got it ! 3352 spring street .
let &apos;s go .
release the general and then we can talk about your family .
he &apos;s innocent .
so you think .
luke , do you think your father would approve
of what you &apos;re doing ?
i just want my family back .
besides , i didn &apos;t start this .
start what ?
dorado falls .
why don &apos;t you tell us your side of the story ?
you first .
all right .
dorado falls was the name of a boat off the coast of cape town .
it was owned by a south african diplomat
who was selling nuclear secrets to iran .
so what &apos;s the big secret ?
there isn &apos;t one . don &apos;t get me wrong ,
lives were lost , but there &apos;s been far worse missions .
his mind chose dorado falls to build a conspiracy around .
this can &apos;t be it .
garcia , it &apos;s an empty lot with a cell phone repeater .
give me a rundown on the buildings in the area
and the years that they were built .
all over it like cat hair on a sofa .
btw , i can usually locate a cell phone within 3 meters ,
but sometimes there are circumstances beyond my control ,
like physical barriers blocking a signal ,
not being in the satellite &apos;s direct line of sight ,
which bounces the signal to a repeater .
garcia , tell me you &apos;ve got something .
oh , sorry . yes , i have something .
there is a hotel built in &apos; 74 that is scheduled for demo ,
and there is a warehouse scheduled
for loft conversion that was built in 1928 .
all right , walls were thicker in the twenties .
what &apos;s the address of the building ?
more gps signal interference . exact address is ...
291 hope street .
291 hope .
intel failed to identify ... two children aboard the boat .
there was a chance to abort ,
but we were given orders to go ahead .
someone in the d.i.a. made that final call .
i never knew it was milgram until now .
sometimes collateral damage can &apos;t be avoided .
you know , people that sit in offices always think that .
this is red echo . we have unwanted targets .
permission to abort .
negative , red echo . the operation is a go .
i repeat , the operation is a go .
you had to shoot those kids , didn &apos;t you ?
they saw us . they would have blown the mission .
they were witnesses .
just like everyone at synalock .
someone wants revenge .
we &apos;ve always known that our own government
might disavow us .
they tried to buy adam with the navy cross , but it didn &apos;t work ,
so they &apos;ve replaced him with an imposter .
and now they &apos;re taking my family one by one .
listen , jenna and ally are safe .
you expect me to believe that ?
i know they &apos;re coming after me .
i &apos;ll make you an offer .
you let milgram go and i &apos;ll take his place .
i don &apos;t want you , i want my family .
the people who have them
will not negotiate unless milgram is freed .
but you need insurance . i get that .
let me take his place .
why would you do that ?
because i &apos;m not just a guy behind a desk .
i was a marine with boots on the ground , just like you .
i know what you &apos;ve been through .
i want you to get your family back .
all right .
where &apos;s hotch and morgan ?
the spring street address didn &apos;t pan out .
they &apos;re searching the warehouse right now .
luke , i need your exact address .
all clear . clear .
we got the general .
he &apos;s still alive .
guys , get him out of here .
now , where the hell is dolan ?
yeah , he used the radio to mask the sound of his movements .
we &apos;re on the move .
this was all part of his plan
to find out who was holding his wife and daughter .
but you never said you were fbi .
he saw the number i called from .
he &apos;d recognize an fbi prefix .
so , what , he &apos;s on his way here to quantico ?
i know the head space he &apos;s in .
he feels all alone right now .
there is no risk he won &apos;t take .
as a navy seal , he did training here . he knows this place .
all right , alert the guard gates and secure the building .
entry and exit through one door only .
an fbi police officer was just found shot to death
in the academy parking structure .
he &apos;s already here .
dolan &apos;s photo &apos;s already been sent on all internal servers .
he &apos;s probably changed his appearance already .
and he &apos;s got 13 floors to hide on .
we should make a general p.a. announcement .
no . he believes he &apos;s on a rescue mission that he can pull off .
as long as he thinks that , he &apos;ll stay calm .
i &apos;ve got hundreds of employees in here
and you want me to do nothing ?
nothing overt .
have your teams quietly search and seal off each floor .
garcia , i need you on the building &apos;s operations computer .
ready and able , sir .
dolan &apos;s got a police radio .
i want all alerts sent through a secure tactical channel .
i can talk to him . he won &apos;t hurt me .
we can &apos;t take that risk .
you &apos;ll be safe in here .
i don &apos;t see him .
he knows how to be invisible .
i got him . he used the dead officer &apos;s i.d.
to enter the 7th floor .
seal it off . nobody in or out .
navy seals never start a mission without an exfiltration plan .
check the exterior and elevator shafts for riggings .
turning exterior cameras now .
a member of the seal team said dolan &apos;s an expert in explosives ,
disabling and building them .
also be on the lookout for explosives .
hello ?
is this sergeant major rossi ?
yes . i was hoping you &apos;d call , luke .
where are you ?
right behind you .
ok , ok easy , easy .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
all right . luke ,
you don &apos;t want to be aiming that around .
snipers have the building covered .
you &apos;re in the crosshairs right now , i can guarantee that .
windows are bulletproof .
high @-@ density lexan , right ?
i &apos;m the one you want .
you can let my team go .
i &apos;ll trade you . give me my wife and daughter .
you have 3 minutes to decide .
is he for real ? he &apos;ll blow us all up , himself included ?
start an evacuation .
can we evacuate everyone in 3 minutes ?
prentiss , i need his wife in here .
no one is seeking revenge here .
you &apos;ve created this conspiracy in your own mind .
you took my family .
to protect them from you after you murdered your own parents .
they were imposters . you have my real parents .
your real parents are dead .
spence--
you want to know what &apos;s really going on ?
you were in a car accident 3 nights ago
and you suffered a head trauma .
if i don &apos;t see jenna and ally now ...
we &apos;re all gonna die .
luke ?
can you hear me ?
i need you to stop what you &apos;re doing .
we &apos;re fine .
me and ally are safe .
luke , you have to let those people go .
the terms haven &apos;t changed .
you don &apos;t believe that &apos;s her ?
i &apos;ve been through this before .
you have one minute .
daddy ? why are you doing this ?
mommy says you don &apos;t feel good .
maybe you need to lie down .
i &apos;m scared , daddy .
i just want to go home .
jenna , can you talk to him about something personal ,
something that only the two of you would know about ?
do you remember our honeymoon ,
when you woke me up at night
and you took me up that mountain
that you &apos;d hiked years before ?
we watched the sun rise .
it was magical .
and you said
that as much as you loved this spot ,
you loved me even more .
do you believe it &apos;s her now ?
your eyes and your mind are playing a trick on you .
when you see your family , you think that they &apos;re imposters ,
but it &apos;s all caused by an illness .
you &apos;re sick , luke . it &apos;s not your fault .
i love you , daddy .
we both do .
come on , now , luke ,
you don &apos;t need that gun .
none of us want to hurt you . you are a hero to this country .
please let us help you .
i want to see jenna .
then you have to do as i ask .
put your weapon down
and close your eyes .
luke , you have to close your eyes .
why ?
because you need to know that your wife is real
and your eyes will trick you .
please , luke .
close your eyes or we will never be together again .
close your eyes .
ok . they &apos;re afraid you might hurt me ,
so they &apos;re gonna handcuff you .
and then i &apos;m going to come out ,
but you have to keep your eyes closed .
i &apos;m right here , baby .
promise me you &apos;ll keep your eyes closed .
is that you ?
is that really you ?
everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
but we have to go to the hospital now , ok ?
first jenna &apos;s gonna cover up your eyes .
daddy ! daddy , where are you going ?
no ! no ! jj , let me have him .
daddy !
get him out of here ! no ! no !
get him out of here !
no !
no !
&quot; we &apos;re born alone , we live alone ,
&quot; we die alone .
&quot; only through our love and friendship
&quot; can we create the illusion for a moment
that we &apos;re not alone . &quot;
orson welles .
no , i didn &apos;t mandate it .
uh , is everything all right ? you ok ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s all in a day &apos;s work , right ?
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
good night .
uh , hotch didn &apos;t order my takedown recertification .
do you want to tell me what &apos;s really going on ?
i just thought we both could use a refresher .
you mean you thought i could use it .
you &apos;re nervous about me being back .
emily ...
what ... you think i &apos;m gonna mess up the team &apos;s rhythm .
i get it . but just come out and say it .
morgan .
ok , fine .
yes , i am nervous .
but not about you .
about me .
emily , i thought i lost you ,
and i blamed myself .
now , you &apos;re back , but i don &apos;t want to be worried
about losing you again and get distracted .
so you wanted some reassurance .
yeah , something like that .
morgan , i cannot imagine what you went through .
it was 7 months of hell .
how can i make it up to you ?
i will do whatever it takes .
just give me 10 hour of training .
ok , you got it .
shooting range on sundays .
i &apos;m there .
and my morning coffee
and a neck rub every day .
