Tell her to go away!
We are gonna be a family.
I finally remember what I did during my blackouts.
It's all because of that one memory.
You're the only person who knew how to save me.
You've seen him before.
And I never thought I'd be happy to see him again.
I've been looking for an apprentice in my tuscan studio.
I've been given an opportunity.
But it means I have to leave.
Goodbye, Mom. I will always love you.
Pascal Lemarchal is on his way from Paris.
Right on schedule.
Stevie Grayson is my biological mother.
Maybe you should give her a chance.
I was in a rehab when I found out I was pregnant.
I couldn't be a decent mother
until I learned how to take care of myself.
I think Stevie Grayson visited my father in prison.
What do you think she wanted?
She came here with secrets.
I'm gonna find out every single one.
Grace is at the core of tragedy.
For if there's no height at which to drop,
no pride taken in the life lived,
you have nothing to lose.
But once in the free fall of disgrace...
the only way to change its momentum
is to use it to your advantage.
I forgot. Tomorrow's the opening night of the opera.
Mm. It's "Pagliacci."
One of Patrick's favorites.
I'm sorry he's gone.
Thank you, Daniel.
My only consolation is that your father won't be there.
I'm sorry Emily will, though.
Well...
Maybe not.
Because that was taken yesterday.
It was my assumption that Aiden had left town
after I kicked him out of the house.
Well, I'm glad he stuck around
because I finally have my ticket out of this marriage.
I'm just waiting for her to get home.
You know, that's the first smile I've seen on you in a while.
May I ask you a favor?
Please give me a front-row seat when you tell her.
So, you're sure she only visited him the one time?
Stevie Grayson, A.K.A. Stephanie Pruitt,
Only checked into the visitor log once -- 1997.
A few days later, she was busted for a D.U.I. and left for Cali.
That's why I never knew.
And neither did my father.
Stevie used her maiden name so he wouldn't know
that she was a Grayson.
Or she didn't want conrad to know that she visited him.
So the first thing we need to figure out
is whose side she's on.
If Jack's trying to wrap his head around his newfound mom...
...this is gonna blow his mind.
Jack stays out of it. You know that.
Well, this is his mother we're talking about.
Who I can approach directly,
given that I called her to town in the first place.
And what if you have to take her down?
Don't you think you've done enough to Jack,
or are you prepared to destroy him all over again?
You're testing me.
Just want to make sure you're not gonna black out
and become your own worst Emily.
But, seriously,
are you sure that you don't want to bring Jack into this?
Absolutely not,
especially since I don't know what "This" is yet.
I had no idea your father was coming back with you.
He wasn't supposed to.
Well, his arrival is burning up the gossip line.
Everyone wats to know who Pascal Lemarchal
will bring with him to the opera tomorrow.
How do you want me to handle it?
There's nothing to handle.
He'll be gone before the curtain rises.
I flew Margaux over in my Bombardier Global 6000.
Great plane.
You should consider buying one,
assuming you didn't lose everything in your divorce.
Well, as you can see, I've been acquiring assets.
By sacrificing so much.
Do you mean the house or Victoria?
'Cause either way,
I'm happy to be free of that fading structure.
Now that you've had time to catch up,
can we get down to business?
Actually, we're on our way to the club for a round of tennis.
Your father's still smarting
from the time I beat him in Saint Tropez.
Revisionist history...
A Grayson speciality.
我会在场的 爸爸
所以放手让我做 好吗
Stevie.
Hi.
It's been a while.
How have you been since last we met?
Well, I'm working on things.
On myself and -- and with Daniel.
Well, then, I'm glad you won't be needing my services.
Actually, can we talk for a moment?
Thought you might want some of the good stuff
before we head off to lunch.
Jack, hi.
You two know each other?
Oh, everybody knows everybody around here.
Can -- can you excuse us for a second?
Of course.
Emily, it was good to see you again.
Yes. You, too.
What are you doing here?
I just bumped into Stevie.
Right after her A.A. meeting? Seems awfully convenient.
Were you hoping that I wouldn't be here?
Look, I just wanted to ask her a few questions.
I know that she's a Grayson, but she was gone
long before all the stuff with your father happened.
Look, you and I are finally getting back to a good place,
and I'm trying to get there with my mom, too.
Please just let me have this one thing.
Leave Stevie out of it.
That is match!
You've lost your touch, my friend.
I'm surprised you still have your competitive spirit.
I thought you were more into frivolous games these days.
I assume you're referring to my stewardship of Voulez.
Using my brand to publish your memoirs --
It's beneath you.
Yeah, well, I've decided to put those on ice.
I mean, I'd hate for the world to think
that my story's anywhere near over.
No, I have new aspirations.
And what are they? The French Open?
Wimbledon?
That's always been your problem, Pascal.
You're too fixated on your own continent.
And where should I be looking?
Right here, the Americas, where I can shepherd
your new North American base of operations.
I mean,think about it -- a Grayson/LeMarchal alliance
would be something remarkable to reckon with.
I remember when we started out,
you said I was a fool for running a media company.
Well, it was a foolish thing to say.
Now, information is the real seat of power,
and Voulez is just the base of the pyramid.
Considering what you've asked of me in the past,
I think I've done enough for you.
Conrad. Hmm, showing up where you don't belong.
If you remember, I got the membership in the divorce,
hoping to avoid awkward run-ins
whenever I choose to have a quiet lunch out.
I was on my way out anyway, having bested an old friend.
Hmm. Victoria, you remember Pascal.
Still losing to Conrad, I see.
Just tried to make him feel good about himself --
something you finally stopped doing after 25 years.
Don't forget -- you're the one who introduced us, Pascal.
I never have.
But now that you've got rid of him,
perhaps you'd like to have lunch with me?
Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
If I remember correctly,
you're never alone for very long.
Hey, hey, hey. Look who's back.
I can't believe it!
I'm only away a short time, yet you've grown so much.
How are things with the house?
Well, escrow is closing in eight days, or...
huit jours.
Your accent is...not bad.
No?
Are you looking to impress my father?
Actually, I was looking to impress his daughter.
Your French will be put to better use with me anyway,
because I'm hoping my father won't stay through tomorrow.
Although, there continue to be rumors of him
going to the opera.
And I got your mother a ticket.
You -- unless you think it's too soon.
No.
No?
No, I w-- I would love for you to meet her.
Okay. Fantastic.
Is your...
your father driving you nuts?
I simply asked for a little muscle
to push Conrad out.
Well, instead, he flies here to play tennis,
and I'm back to being his little girl --
or at least that's how he treats me.
Right.
When I first started working, my dad, like, wouldn't let me
make any of the deposits or deal with any of the vendors.
What did you do?
Well, I told him to go to hell, and I did it anyway.
And it worked out
'cause he finally started trusting me to run the business.
Of course...
we ran a bar, not a multibillion-dollar company.
A parent is a parent.
And you're lucky to have such a good one.
Oh, you look sun-kissed, Conrad.
I was beating an old friend at a game of tennis --
Pascal LeMarchal.
He'd like you -- sophisticated, smart, beautiful.
Ah, but on the downside, you're happily married, right?
About that...
So, you had me drag Stevie back here
just to stir up trouble with Victoria?
Well, to be clear, I thought you were sincere
about your desire to get divorced.
But, yeah, it was a convenient way to get back
at my second ex while making amends with my first.
Oh, well, from what I hear, you had nothing to make up for.
Wasn't Stevie on her way to rock bottom back in the day?
While we were married, yes.
So, did something happen after your divorce?
Well, we crossed paths a few years later,
and she tried to reinsert herself into my business --
not a good choice for anyone.
You know, in the long run, I probably did her a favor.
Still...
There you go. Here's your blanket, sweet boy.
So, this Margaux --
When do I get to meet her?
How about tomorrow night?
This must be love if you're going to the opera.
I'm in.
Yeah, she, uh...
She kind of took me by surprise.
I'm proud of you, Jack.
Moving on is a brave thing.
Though I see this, and...
I wish I'd had the courage
to get back in your life sooner --
And not just because I could have met her,
but...
What?
It's silly.
Maybe things would have turned out different.
Trust me.
What happened was gonna happen.
I met Amanda's father once in prison.
I was one of the people that thought he got a raw deal.
And if you don't mind me asking,
what did Amanda believe?
That her father was an innocent man.
And you?
That the people who follow this path
end up hurt...or worse.
Because of my former husband and his family?
Yes.
Which is why I'd like to drop it.
Marta.
You're requested in the study, Mrs. Grayson.
Well, I'm glad to see you finally came to your senses
and hired the staff back.
Well, now that you're leaving, I figured it was time.
Excuse me?
We're getting a divorce.
As a sign of good faith,
I've accessed family funds to make you an offer
that should last several decades,
since I know how much you covet our lifestyle.
It's far more than you deserve,
but small price to pay to get you out.
Yes, but according to the legal definition of adultery,
this doesn't prove a thing.
Well, we'll see about that when we haul you into court.
I can't believe this.
I forgave Daniel for so much.
He shot me on the night
that should have been a dream come true
and forced me into blaming Lydia Davis.
I did it all for Daniel.
After everything we've been through, all of the anguish,
who could blame me for finding comfort
in the arms of someone else?
Consider that a preview to my testimony.
I'll see you at the opera tomorrow, Daniel.
You, too, Victoria.
Let her go.
She's trying to goad you.
I want her out.
But I thought you wanted a divorce.
Oh, I'll get one when the time is right.
Well, sounds like you handled it with panache.
Still, I can't believe Daniel had a tail on me and I didn't know it.
Well, you were a little off your game at the time.
Well, now that I'm back,
the last thing I need is Daniel tracking my every move.
I can't afford any more wild cards.
Emily Grayson.
Why don't you tell me who you really are?
"Everybody knows everybody" -- that's what you said, right?
But was everybody the maid of honor
at Amanda's wedding?
That must have been quite the betrayal to the Graysons --
you supporting a Clarke --
unless you were double-crossing Amanda.
Does Jack suspect something?
Look, I don't know who you think I am,
but I'm not just another witness that you can toy with.
You call me into town under the guise of hating Daniel,
and then you claim to be happy.
I think it's pretty clear
that you haven't been honest with me since the moment we met.
Why should I believe you're an ally?
Because Amanda was like a sister to me.
And what the Graysons did to her and her father makes me sick.
The real the question is, why are you married to Daniel?
What's your stake in this?
Like Amanda...
maybe you...
I think David Clarke was innocent.
Did you ever do anything about it?
I tried.
I even met with him once.
A few days later,
I was pulled over and blew a 0.14.
I never drove drunk. Conrad had set me up.
And a D.U.I. is grounds for disbarment.
And if he was willing to go that far,
at least you know you were onto something.
You're looking for answers, too, aren't you?
For Amanda.
Maybe I can help.
Thanks, Stevie, but...
after everything that's happened,
it's important for me to put Jack's feelings first.
I know he wants to let this go.
Javier?
Somebody didn't forget what I taught him inside.
What the hell are you doing?
I was looking for a bottle opener.
Please tell me you did not hack your way out of prison.
No, man. I'm out. On the up-and-up.
And breaking the law already.
You have some serious security breaches,
which I can help you with.
You said I could crash here.
I-if you had nowhere else to st--
you have nowhere else to stay.
But what about your mom?
You'd think she'd appreciate that I used the money I stole
from the N.S.A. to put her through night school,
but she just can't seem to get over the first part
or the "getting caught" part.
Well, you were kind of an idiot.
I mean, signing your hacks with an anagram of your name?
Which you told me, like, every day.
Yeah, because you had a lot to learn,
and I had a lot of time to teach you.
How about you let me put it to good use, huh?
Come on. What do you got in the hopper these days?
I bet it is something huge.
All right, you know what?
Don't worry about what I'm working on.
Just...focus on finding yourself a place to stay.
For now... I can crash?
For one day. One day only.
I had to meet the man
who took snapshots of the wiliest person I know.
You're good.
Thank you, Mrs. Grayson.
But your son said I'd satisfied his need for my services.
Well, I have a new angle I'm working on,
and I think you're just the person to help me out.
Excuse me, Mrs. Grayson, but your dress has arrived.
Already?
Oh. Would you excuse me?
I had an inspiration for what you could wear to the opera.
Well, I applaud your presumption.
I've already picked out a gown.
Not like this one.
I had it overnighted by the designers.
You're friends with Dolce & Gabbana?
I have many friends.
Well, I recently had dinner with Domenico.
Your name didn't come up.
Oh, really?
Well, I'm trying not to give people reasons to talk about me.
Which is a big difference from the man I met years ago.
I have changed.
So have you. Divorce suits you.
Your charms won't work on me, Pascal.
Not this time.
Perhaps we should go, then.
Oh, maybe I should try on that gown.
The designers are friends of mine, after all.
I wouldn't want to offend.
And it's stunning.
I look forward to seeing you at "Pagliacci."
Saw Emily last night.
Did she call you?
I went to her.
What's going on there?
Nothing.
She sent me away out of loyalty to you.
We've been through a lot.
And the lawyer in me says you both want to do right by Amanda,
so why discourage that?
I know it's selfish, but...
I don't want another thing taken from me.
This is worth fighting for.
I don't know that it is.
An innocent man was put behind bars.
If there's anything that can be done, I want to help.
It's that important to you?
Cases like David Clarke's were the reason I became a lawyer.
I wanted to be in the trenches, fighting for the underdog,
which is what I do every day in my divorce practice.
For me, it's all about justice.
And how were you gonna get that for David Clarke?
After he was convicted, I looked into his case,
and I received a suspicious piece of evidence,
but I couldn't verify the source.
Once I was disbarred, my firm confiscated everything.
And with that... went all hope.
Now there's no way to get that information.
Push the 36th floor.
Jack, you sure you're up for this?
Well, if you could have just hacked the files, then --
Well, if you'd wanted something from this century, no problem,
but everything else is on hard drives
that aren't connected to anything else.
So, therefore, you have to physically break into their archives.
And this thing's rigged to open the security door?
Hmm. It will be.
Look, once you're in,
you're gonna locate the June 1997 hard --
Grab it and get out of there. I know. Yeah.
I will meet you after my meeting.
Ms. Stevie's old firm is fairly high-profile,
and I need new lawyers
if I'm gonna flood the market with new product.
Jack, I can't keep depriving the world of my genius.
Yeah, about that, do you want me to stop the elevator?
I just have to get through the security firewall
through the network, and then we should be good to go.
Almost there.
Oh, Jack of little faith.
This just came for you.
Thank you.
Nolan Ross.
I have a meeting with the head of the patent department.
Yes, Mr. Ross. One second, please.
Nolan Ross is here to see you, sir.
Please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Thanks.
June '97.
June '97.
There ain't no dates.
Look, I work fast, so I want a team that can secure patents
as quickly as I'm going to need them.
All due respect, Mr. Ross, seems of late,
your legal needs are more the "Keep me off death row" kind.
Well, last year was fraught with unforeseeable obstacles,
but I am ready to chart a new course.
Well, if that's the case, we may be interested in your comeback.
Don't call it a comeback.
I've been here for years.
我不知道该拿哪个
Excuse me.
Our time is money, Mr. Ross.
And I can afford it.
Nolan!
Nope. You got upgraded to Javier.
Do you know what year the firm was founded?
I'm sorry. Who is this?
Do you want their info or mine?
What year, and what's the first number on the drives?
All right. Uh...
Uh, uh, 1978, and, um, E23754.
Are you sure that's not "56"?
You're right. It's 56.
Thought so.
It's a basic rolling-code crypto.
I saw tats in prison that were harder to figure out than that.
Oh, right. Of course.
You're Nolan's friend from prison.
Okay, you want June '97.
It's gonna be L39935, L39936.
And grab L39937 in case you read wrong again.
And I just broke my probation on landline,
which is gonna be traced in 5, 4, 3 -- later.
L39935.
You're still here.
I thought without a future as a partner,
you would lose interest in Voulez.
I was curious as to how, in this new-media era,
a magazine could start out so successfully,
so I had a forensic accountant look into the books,
and I-I think I may have underestimated you, Pascal.
You also underestimate the power of the Lemarchal name.
He's right.
Now get out.
That's my girl.
No, I'm talking to you, Pascal.
This is my magazine. Its success is because of me.
But your presence here is not only unneeded,
It's unwanted.
See? That's what happens when you have kids too young.
You don't raise them properly.
Oh, well, that may be so,
but allow me to applaud your success at raising the bottom line.
It appears, Margaux, that Voulez is losing money
to the tune of a million every quarter.
Our ledgers show we're in the black, Conrad.
No, that's true.
But when they cross the pond to Pascal's accountants,
the numbers change.
That's a savvy move, pascal -- indulging your daughter
while creating a handsome quarterly write-off.
What? Is this true?
This is why I said business wasn't for you, sweetheart.
You're an evil man.
Now this from a woman who fired my son to save her company,
whom you're more than welcome to reinstate once I've moved
into the Lemarchal Manhattan headquarters.
That's assuming we now see eye-to-eye, Pascal.
Are you sure you want to go down that road?
'Cause it goes back 20 years.
It was important to Stevie that you have them.
Why did you do this?
Because your father was important to me, too.
I don't want you involved, Jack.
Emily, your dad was a good man, an innocent man.
And isn't that what this is all about?
The fight for justice?
This is my fight, not yours.
Would you just let me help?
No!
Look, you were right.
We're finally getting back to a good place.
I honored what you asked me before --
I left your mother alone.
I need you to do the same.
Just stay out of it. Please.
What are you doing?
I retained your P.I.,
who discovered that Aiden's in Bermuda,
which is good because it means he poses no imminent threat.
Hold on a second, y-you're using my detective?
Since when?
Since Emily rejected that huge settlement.
I was testing her, Daniel.
Grifters have their price, and Emily couldn't be bought.
She's targeting our family and not our fortune.
The best way to expose what she's after
is to keep her here with you.
Absolutely not. I'm getting that divorce.
Don't you find it odd that she happened to date Aiden Mathis,
whose father planted the bomb on flight 197
and that she was close with Amanda Clarke,
whose childhood home she was living in.
There's a connection.
I'm going to find out what her plan is.
To what end?
Your theories could take months or even years to prove.
Now, right now the only plan that I'm concerned about
is getting her the hell out of my life.
What were you thinking?
I should have told you Jack approached me.
Well, it can't happen again, Nolan.
We've talked about this. What the --
Where the hell did you even get this stuff?
Javier. Uh, he decoded the labels.
Javier?
He's this millennial computer genius from prison that I --
Are you kidding me?
He got out. He landed on my doorstep.
I don't know. He looks up to me.
Lord knows why.
I know I've been a little dormant lately,
but...i've still got a lot of ideas.
You don't have to prove yourself to me, Nolan.
I just hope you didn't tell Javier too much.
Oh, don't worry.
He had no idea what we were stealing or why.
Good.
Hey, look at this.
That's a bombshell.
But who made the bomb?
My next target.
Hmm, why don't you practice for the spotlight
'cause it's gonna keep getting hotter.
Charlotte, I haven't seen you in forever.
I cover Voulez' gossip line now, so busy, busy.
But that doesn't mean we can't catch up over lunch.
Oh, I'd love that.
See what I mean?
Pascal Lemarchal just arrived.
I'll introduce you.
Pascal.
Hi, Charlotte. How are you?
Have you met my sister-in-law, Emily Grayson?
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Really, yeah.
Excuse me.
I knew you couldn't resist.
Well, fine art's meant to be displayed.
And appreciated.
Keep your distance, pascal.
This dress may touch my body, but you'll never be so lucky.
You look handsome, Mr. Porter.
It's a pleasure, Ms. Grayson.
"Stevie," Please.
It's so nice to meet the woman who's making my son so happy.
If you'll both excuse me.
Sure.
Ah. You must be Jack.
Mr. Lemarchal, It's so nice to meet you.
I always enjoy meeting a fellow self-made man.
I'm in town for a few more days.
Hope we can spend some time together.
I would like that very much.
Should we, uh -- should we find our seats?
Um, I'll just be a moment.
All right. Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Yes?
I thought you were leaving tomorrow.
Oh, I might stay a little bit longer
to handle some unfinished business.
And maybe teach you a thing or two, sweetheart.
Excuse me.
I'll fill you in on everything later,
but it's time to show our fathers what we're capable of.
Care to join me?
I'm certainly in a fighting mood.
Mom.
You are not gonna believe this.
This just came across the Voulez tip line.
It can't be true, can it?
How could you?
I'm sorry?
Faking a pregnancy to force Daniel into marriage.
What kind of lunatic are you?!
You want to do this now?
Your medical records are out there.
Now everyone knows.
Those are private.
So it's true?
Where are you going, Emily?!
You can run Emily, but this will follow you.
Your dirty, little secret is out.
You're nothing but a fraud and a liar
who deceived my son into marriage!
Emily Thorne, you are done here.
After everything I've done to protect you, Daniel.
This is over.
You don't know what you're doing.
Emily, dear, it's time to leave.
Don't touch me!
The divorce papers,
I had them redrafted,
so I don't think that settlement amount is still in there.
You'll be leaving with nothing.
Well, I still have the fact that Daniel shot me.
You called a press conference, got up on that balcony,
and told the world that Lydia shot you.
So, which story is it? Hmm?
After last night, no one's going to believe you.
You'll look like a resentful woman
caught in a lie about a pregnancy that never existed.
Then I guess you both got what you wanted.
Oh, I just love the opera.
You never know what performance you're going to get.
Did you leak the medical records?
No. The timing was curious.
I love you, Daniel.
And I simply saw an opportunity to help you, and I took it,
but I'm still keeping my eye on Ms. Thorne.
If she sticks around, your theory's correct.
She's targeting us.
And I will find out why.
If you get sauce on my couch,
you're buying me a new one, and, uh, I meant what I said.
You can stay for one day, which is over now.
Is that any way to treat your tech support?
And besides, I can't legally leave anyways.
I, uh...
I sort of gave my parole officer your address.
You put yourself under house arrest at my house?
I just want to live alone. Is that too much to ask?
Is this a... is this a picture of me?
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm thinking about becoming an artiste.
Not according to these scribbles, but...
Wait. What is the rest of this, really?
It's an idea for a web aggregator.
Think of it as antisocial media.
I just... can't crack it.
That's 'cause you're using c++.
I could fix this in a nanosecond with binary.
Do you see? That's what I'm talking about.
And, seriously, thanks for letting me stay, man.
You're the only guy I liked inside,
so I'm in your debt.
Well, based on, uh, what I'm seeing here...
You might be able to repay me.
The one time I miss the opera,
something interesting actually happens.
It was extraordinary.
I feel pretty bad for your daughter-in-law.
Oh, I'm sure by now, she's my ex-daughter-in-law.
I was on my way out.
Please...feel free to drink on my tab.
Now, Pascal, come on.
You and I both know you're gonna give me what I want.
Conrad, I understand you don't hear "No" very often,
but I have no intention of merging our companies.
Ever.
Well, what if I got you the one thing you've always wanted
but never had?
I have everything a man could want.
Except Victoria.
Hey.
Hey.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Press is saying some pretty harsh stuff.
No, I'm fine. Everything went as expected.
Of course. You were behind it.
Look, as much as I hated using Charlotte,
I had to create a public break from the Graysons,
and I needed them to feel like they won.
Which you would only do if you had a new plan.
Tell me what's going on.
You know how dangerous this is,
and I don't want you getting hurt again.
I'm not sitting on the sidelines anymore, Emily.
What you are doing,
it's not just about justice for your father.
It's also for Declan...
And Amanda.
Yes, and I will get it for them.
I got you that information yesterday,
which means I'm now involved, and so is my mother.
So you can either make this a fight,
or you can get good with it now.
What was on those drives?
"Conrad, per you request,
I handled TWM.
Your DC plan is safe."
I assume "DC" is your dad,
but what's, what's "TWM"?
I don't know, but I'm gonna figure it out.
How?
My mom said she never knew who wrote the letter.
I think I do.
Look at this.
There's a shadow on the edge of the note where it was scanned,
which means it wasn't standard American measurements.
It was European.
And this is a note I received
when I agreed to let "Voulez" cover my wedding.
It's the same handwriting.
Pascal is a part of this?
Yeah, I think he is.
And I know you love his daughter,
which is why I don't want you involved in this.
Then we have to take the risk...
And hope that there's no collateral damage.
I'll make sure there won't be.
Pascal won't even know he was hit.
