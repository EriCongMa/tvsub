hey , is there a problem with the pump ?
negative . the pump is fine .
stand by . let me check the pressure .
good . it &apos;s all good .
all right . something must be blocking it .
boo !
what , man !
kill the pump ! kill the pump !
kill the pump !
kill the pump !
you gotta help me , man ! come on !
the barge moves up and down the coast
repairing beaches from weather damage .
and how deep is the water that this sand &apos;s coming from ?
about 100 meters . the pump spews out
all kinds of stuff from the ocean floor .
and you do this every year ?
first time in jacksonville .
we just moved the barge here 3 days ago .
thousands of miles of open water
and blind luck uncovers an unsub &apos;s graveyard .
i had them stop the pump once i realized what this was .
we &apos;re going to need you to turn the pump back on .
if we don &apos;t keep digging , we &apos;re not gonna know
how many bodies there are down there .
what &apos;d you find ?
a scary math problem .
i just finished doing my jacksonville missing persons sweep .
there are 6 unresolved cases , 3 of which are kids .
and you have 9 adult bodies .
then he &apos;s not hunting here . widen your search .
yeah , i will do that . just remember ,
it is difficult to i.d. match a thigh bone or coccyx .
agent hotchner .
yes , sir .
detective foreman . call me jt .
not the most cushy arrangement ,
but it &apos;ll keep your team close to the crime scene for now .
well , thank you for setting it up .
of course .
this will help us preserve what we can .
excuse me .
yeah , i &apos;m back .
you know , based on the parasites
on the most recent kill , the unsub killed
as recently as a month ago ,
which means he &apos;s still active .
how did you establish a timeline so quickly ?
by reverse engineering mother nature .
each year , sand and sediment cover up the remains ,
creating layers on the ocean floor .
that makes sense . the deeper the pump dug , the older the remains .
9 victims in 9 years means that he &apos;s in control of his urges .
any sense of the victimology ?
only that he likes variety .
pelvic bone width indicates that he kills both men and woman ,
and skull structure says he crosses racial lines as well .
agent hotchner , excuse me .
we found 3 more remains .
if he &apos;s been dumping this long ,
it &apos;s not just out of convenience .
there &apos;s got to be an emotional tie as well .
he &apos;ll change his m.o. because he has to ,
but he won &apos;t be happy about it .
then he &apos;ll have the entire atlantic to choose from .
help !
help !
help !
&quot; the sea has never been friendly to man .
&quot; at most , it has been the accomplice of human restlessness . &quot;
joseph conrad .
you know , that site is known for record catches of yellowmouth .
so the unsub was smart enough
to dump during the off season and avoid fishermen .
then he &apos;s a local .
i &apos;m afraid to ask--
could this be one of my guys ?
we run interdiction exercises around that spot .
no , it &apos;s most likely another fisherman .
well , how could you know ?
come here , i &apos;ll show you .
see , he disarticulates the bodies at the joints .
it helps them sink .
now , that &apos;s a skill that only an experienced butcher
or fisherman would have .
the bone nicks indicate this guy inflicted
a lot of pain on his victims , which means he &apos;s a sadist .
excuse me .
enchantress of all things possible . use your imagination .
can you enchant me with a list of boat owners in jacksonville ?
you know i can , baby . ok , in duvall county
we &apos;re looking at 31,047 registered boats .
well , limit that to the boats
that can only be operated by one person .
ok , i &apos;m gonna need a lot more than this to do that .
it &apos;s still looking like a list
that makes &quot; war and peace &quot; read like a comic book .
hey , you ok ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ll keep you posted .
aye aye , captain .
why wouldn &apos;t you be ok ?
it &apos;s just in cases like these
where there &apos;s only pieces , it &apos;s tough .
the best we can do is catalog them
and wait for the unsub to screw up somewhere else .
you think he &apos;s moved on ?
if he &apos;s smart he has .
and so far , this guy seems very smart .
have you nailed down the victimology ?
i found a unique evolution , actually .
the earliest victims appear to be high @-@ risk .
these lesions are consistent with syphilis ,
most likely a prostitute .
this one has severely ground and missing teeth ,
commonly seen in excessive methamphetamine abuse .
and then all of a sudden out of nowhere ,
a sea change--
healthier and stronger victims
all the way through to number 12 .
lower @-@ risk , harder for him to hunt .
what do we know about the first victim ?
you know , that one &apos;s tough .
he or she has been in the water so long ,
they &apos;re mostly bone fragments .
i can attempt to reconstruct ...
you &apos;ve got 3 hours .
i can do it in 2 .
make it one .
how much has gotten out ?
can &apos;t tell . some of these news crews are national .
if the unsub doesn &apos;t know we found his graveyard yet ,
he will soon .
then we &apos;ll hear from everyone
who &apos;s ever filed a missing persons report .
maybe we can use this to our advantage .
i could talk to them .
it might feed his ego ,
take the sting out of him losing his site .
it could keep him in the area .
good .
at this moment it would be premature to comment
on the details of the case .
our goal is to identify
the recovered remains as quickly as possible
for the families involved .
in order to expedite that , we &apos;re asking
that the families or friends of people who went missing
on the east coast of the united states
since the year 2000 come forward .
we &apos;ll be matching dna to the remains ,
and it will be helpful for us to have a personal item
from each of the missing persons .
an article of clothing , a hairbrush ,
a blanket , a pillowcase ,
photographs or medical or dental records if you have them .
we &apos;re also looking for items of significance
to help us determine the last known
whereabouts of each of the victims .
correspondence like letters or emails will be helpful .
morgan was telling me how difficult these cases can be .
who did he lose ?
aunt yvonne . how you doing ?
derek , is my baby girl on that beach ?
we &apos;ve talked about this .
there &apos;s no reason to think she &apos;d be down here .
she went missing 7 years ago and from charleston .
that &apos;s east coast , just like your boss said .
come on now , auntie ,
we both know what happened to cindi .
somehow you &apos;re just gonna have to learn to accept it .
i &apos;ll stay in touch .
ok . thank you , derek .
some years back ,
morgan &apos;s cousin fled a stalker .
she made it to south carolina .
she was never seen or heard from again .
was it the stalker ?
he killed himself 2 weeks later ,
so we never found out for sure .
but morgan &apos;s profile led straight to him .
so whenever unidentified female remains turn up ,
he gets that call .
why are you doing this ?
come on , man .
come on , man , talk to me .
no , no , no , wait , wait , wait , wait .
listen ! not again .
why are you doing this ?
son of a ... bitch !
alex cottle , beth riley , louise jones ,
come with me , please .
we were working on a gene therapy project at johns hopkins
when samantha got the news .
parkinson &apos;s .
that must have been pretty rough on her .
i was her best friend ,
and all i ever got was this postcard .
&quot; weze , i &apos;m not going back to school .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing there for me .
&quot; i need to find myself . love , sammy . &quot;
does this sound like her to you ?
not really , no .
she would have written a 12 @-@ page letter .
but she addressed it to &quot; weze . &quot;
she &apos;s the only one who called me that .
i &apos;d like to keep this if that &apos;s all right . it may be evidence .
yeah , ok .
thank you .
did you happen to bring anything of hers
that we could get dna from ?
well , everyone on the project
mapped their dna into the database .
i &apos;ll need that information .
you know , on this first victim ,
the more i work on this skeleton ,
the more i question its condition .
the ocean floor preserved the other remains remarkably well .
i think something else caused this .
could this be the age of these bones as opposed to the others ?
well , he &apos;s significantly older . arthritis in the joints
put him in his late 50s ,
but that doesn &apos;t account for this degree of breakdown .
in fact , nothing in the ocean would .
if the unsub &apos;s responsible ,
maybe he didn &apos;t disarticulate this victim
but he tore him apart instead .
and look at this . this bone has a defensive wound ,
like he held it up before the blow came down .
i think the bone @-@ smashing occurred
while the victim was still alive .
overkill .
he worked out a lot of aggression on this victim .
he didn &apos;t do that with the others .
that would indicate a personal relationship .
father ?
that would be my guess . and not a good one ,
based on the low calcium levels consistent with alcoholism .
think it &apos;s time to rethink cindi ?
rossi , the only connection right now is charleston .
it &apos;s weak .
victim number 5 is an african @-@ american woman in her 20s
who died in 2004 .
that &apos;s not weak .
my aunt has spent years obsessing over cindi &apos;s last few hours .
she doesn &apos;t go out .
she doesn &apos;t sleep .
she forgets to take her medication .
it &apos;s killing her , rossi .
it hasn &apos;t been easy for you , either .
but everything i &apos;ve learned as a profiler has taught me
that it &apos;s not about what i want to be true .
it &apos;s about what i can prove .
so i can &apos;t go there .
we got a match .
meet our first confirmed victim ,
dr. samantha cormick .
since her dna profile was already developed ,
we were able to save a couple of days .
so he dumps here and hunts in charleston .
tourist spot . larger victim pool .
it &apos;s a 250 @-@ mile trip back here . it &apos;s a lot of exposure .
torture takes time and privacy ,
and disarticulation is a mess .
you know , he could have a mobile torture chamber
in his truck or trailer . we &apos;ve seen that before .
or maybe he doesn &apos;t drive at all .
he could do it all from his boat .
well , if he gets them on board in charleston
and sails them out here ,
he would have time for both .
and nobody would even notice a fisherman
tossing chum into the water .
garcia , we &apos;ve got more information about the unsub &apos;s boat .
it might help you narrow your list .
ok . bring it .
can you give us boats with cabins
large enough to hide a torture chamber ?
torture chamber ? &apos; cause that would , yeah ,
totally be listed in the manufacturer &apos;s specs of amenities .
try cabin dimensions .
start at 10 by 10 feet and cap it at 30 .
that is totally gonna take forever
&apos;cause i gotta go record by record .
you are lucky i love you . bye .
we need to go back to the families
and see who else got a postcard .
this might finally be a link to victimology .
sending goodbye postcards as a ruse is a gamble .
even if written under duress ,
the victim could sneak their own message into it .
i don &apos;t think this was written under duress .
you said dr. cormick wasn &apos;t
taking medication for parkinson &apos;s , right ?
look at her handwriting .
no indication of tremors or shaking .
there &apos;s a drug called trilamide .
in minute doses it treats parkinson &apos;s ,
but its main use is for seasickness .
something a fisherman would have access to .
and criminals in south america .
intel reports say they figured out
a high dose makes the victim totally compliant .
yeah , they slip it in your drink
or blow the powder in your face
and nasodermal absorption &apos;s almost immediate .
you &apos;re instantaneously susceptible to any suggestion .
there have been reports
of locals letting thugs into their apartments
to rob them , even helping them load the getaway trucks .
dad , please ...
don &apos;t listen to him .
fight it .
ok .
understand ?
yes .
good .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s james .
choose one .
good . that &apos;s gonna be the knife you kill yourself with .
we got 4 more postcards . samantha makes 5 .
any patterns geographically ?
geographically each victim was from a different state .
but they all went missing from charleston ?
two of them did . the other three were mailed from miami .
he &apos;s bouncing between two cities ?
you know , miami makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s a coastal town with a lot of tourists .
and by alternating hunting grounds ,
he ensures that neither city pays too much attention
to people going missing .
but why these 5 ? what connects them ?
right now it &apos;s just the postcards .
they may be the rosetta stone that we need .
you know , the victims write the postcards ,
but the unsub dictates the message .
he might have revealed something about himself through them .
start a linguistic profile .
we need to sit down with the people who got these postcards .
no , boats around here get handed down
from generation to generation .
so none of the locals would fish in charleston and miami ?
a guy like you &apos;re describing ,
he starts brining in blackfin from carolina
or kingfish from miami , we &apos;d notice .
well , if you hear of anything that might help ,
please give us a call .
we need to rethink how our unsub finds his victims .
these guys are loners . our guy isn &apos;t .
yeah , that guy needs good social skills ,
a boat that &apos;s inviting , recreational .
what if he runs a charter outfit ?
plenty of customers in charleston and miami .
so he takes out a group , but how does he pick his victim ?
he starts with the passengers that are traveling alone .
that lets him know they &apos;re vulnerable .
harmless questions would tell him
who would miss them back at home .
and if they pay with a credit card ,
he &apos;d just tear up the transaction .
then there &apos;s never any record of them being on board .
well , that might tell us how he &apos;s hunting .
the question is ... who ?
what brought your son to miami ?
work .
he kept saying this was it .
this is the fresh start he needed .
when did you start to get worried ?
one week maybe .
why did it take you so long
to file a missing persons report ?
i got this postcard ,
and it &apos;s her handwriting .
i lived with this handwriting for 4 years .
i didn &apos;t think to question it .
so you &apos;d say she was a responsible person ?
come on , rossi . yes .
next question .
look , derek , i know it &apos;s unpleasant .
but we &apos;re looking at the risk level of all the victims ,
even the potential ones .
cindi didn &apos;t drink . she didn &apos;t do drugs .
she kept a steady job .
and what about the stalker ?
what about him ?
did she sleep with him ?
you know the answer to that .
well , maybe you ought to rethink it .
maybe you &apos;ll remember something .
they went on one date .
he got one good @-@ night kiss .
but this was a classic power assertive stalker ,
and i &apos;d seen enough of these cases to know how they end .
so you encouraged her to move .
now , you never told me that .
now , why did she go to charleston ?
i don &apos;t know .
i told her to pick a city and not to tell anyone ,
and that included me .
well , let &apos;s think about it for a second .
had she been there before ? did she have friends there ?
maybe she just wanted to be close to the ocean .
what ?
fourth of july 1996 .
the whole family was picnicking on the lake .
and all the kids ended up on paddle boats .
and was cindi on one of them ?
no . no , that &apos;s what &apos;s weird .
she stayed on the shore the whole day .
tell your son you abandoned him .
i didn &apos;t .
do it .
then why did you give up custody ?
i couldn &apos;t afford the lawyers anymore .
it just got to the point
where i had to get on with my life .
but he wouldn &apos;t let you .
would you ?
tell him you hate him .
no .
do it !
tell him exactly how you felt at that time .
i--
i just stopped loving you .
you have something you want to say to your father ?
dad ...
please ...
stop stabbing yourself .
the unsub we &apos;re looking for
is a 30- to 40 @-@ year @-@ old fisherman currently chartering
his boat to tourists trying to find a victim of medium risk .
what &apos;s medium risk ?
say your car breaks down in a bad neighborhood .
once you &apos;re outside your normal routine ,
there &apos;s a greater chance for victimization .
hence , medium risk .
each of these victims was trying to start over .
they were out of a relationship or starting a new job ,
but to this unsub , they were abandoning their responsibilities .
we can tell this in the messages that he forces them to write .
&quot; it &apos;s too much . &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s nothing for me here . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s better if i leave . &quot;
we believe this anger stems from his first victim--his father .
most likely a local fisherman , definitely an alcoholic ,
and based on this unsub &apos;s level of sadism ,
violently abusive .
he &apos;s also the first person to abandon the unsub .
walked out on his family , maybe , even wrote a postcard like this .
so the unsub picked a site of significance to them both ,
a spot known to local fisherman that he turned into his prison .
but that &apos;s gone now , so where will he head next ?
well , he can &apos;t go back to that spot ,
but he won &apos;t leave jacksonville either .
that prison was his responsibility ,
and without it , he &apos;ll cling to what he knows .
he &apos;ll change his m.o. , and that &apos;ll make him erratic .
he &apos;ll escalate his sadism and he &apos;ll kill uncontrollably
until he finds another spot in the ocean to replace this one .
thank you very much .
aunt yvonne .
he said you would need dna .
i hated you when you left .
did you know that ?
yeah .
so why did you even take me back ?
james--
i couldn &apos;t live without you anymore .
and i won &apos;t let you go again , i promise .
dad ...
what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;ll figure it out .
i was right , wasn &apos;t i ?
you found her body on the beach .
actually , we &apos;re trying to rule her out .
i know you , derek .
i know that look in your eye .
there is something , isn &apos;t there ?
auntie , i &apos;ve been doing this job a long time .
the things i &apos;ve seen ...
i don &apos;t want to drag you into them .
honey , i &apos;m already in . you don &apos;t have to protect me .
i need to find out about my cindi .
all right .
one of the victims that we found
fits cindi &apos;s general description .
i am not saying that it &apos;s her .
but if it is , something doesn &apos;t add up .
i &apos;m hoping you can help .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
was cindi afraid of water ?
no . she loved to swim .
it &apos;s just that one of the fourth of july picnics
i remember she wouldn &apos;t get on the paddle boats .
oh , well , boats were a whole different story .
if cindi as much as sat in a canoe ,
she &apos;d get violently seasick .
he &apos;s not finding his victims through his boat ?
if he tried to talk cindi into a charter , she wouldn &apos;t even stop .
his ruse doesn &apos;t fit her .
we don &apos;t know that she &apos;s victim number 5 .
i still rushed her dna to quantico . they &apos;re working on it for me .
but until we get a confirmation , we can &apos;t make any assumptions
based on her behavior .
i &apos;m not saying that we throw away the profile .
i &apos;m just saying let &apos;s expand our thinking .
magic eightball .
garcia , we &apos;re looking into other ways
that the unsub might be finding his victims .
what are the victims &apos; histories in charleston or miami ?
of the 5 we &apos;ve i.d. &apos; d so far ...
there isn &apos;t any .
maybe he meets them in transit .
how did they get there ?
right . right .
ok .
um , but there &apos;s nothing there either .
but how is that possible ?
these people are starting their lives over .
the whole point is to travel .
even if they paid cash , garcia ,
there &apos;d be a name on a ticket .
yeah . no , i agree with you ,
but my binary boxes are never wrong ,
so however these folks got from point &quot; a &quot; to point unsub ,
there &apos;s no record of .
this guy &apos;s not abducting them in miami or charleston .
he &apos;s grabbing them while they &apos;re en route .
clean it up !
dad !
dad !
you know , if the unsub &apos;s abducting in transit ,
how can he cover it up ?
i felt like we were close with the charter idea .
maybe he doesn &apos;t abduct them off a boat .
the details of his ruse were right .
what means of transportation doesn &apos;t issue a ticket in advance ?
passenger trains .
a conductor can hand @-@ write a ticket
once you &apos;re already on board .
actually , most of the smaller stations aren &apos;t even manned .
you have to buy tickets on board .
you know , the train is a concept
that attracts people who are trying to start over .
the appeal of escape , of romance .
if he &apos;s a conductor , he &apos;s in a target @-@ rich environment .
my men pulled a body out of the water .
agent morgan &apos;s at the autopsy now .
the wounds on the thigh show hesitation marks .
an unsub this experienced wouldn &apos;t display that .
i don &apos;t think the unsub did .
the angle indicates left @-@ handed dominance .
the file says this guy was left @-@ handed , too .
you know , if he &apos;d been given trilamide ,
the unsub could have forced him to cut himself .
it makes sense for a sadist with abandonment issues ,
but why didn &apos;t he finish the job ?
the victim must have gotten a chance to escape and took it .
but how ? the trilamide kept him compliant enough to hurt himself .
it overcame his self @-@ preservation instinct .
well , then another instinct must have been stronger .
like what ?
a protective one .
this guy was mentally and physically compromised ,
but he still went after the unsub with everything he had .
who would he fight that hard for ?
a child , garcia .
search nationwide missing persons reports
for men traveling with their kids .
am i looking for a son or daughter ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
no , no , i &apos;m sorry , honey . no dice .
hey , what if they &apos;re not reported as missing yet ?
yeah , of course not .
when the unsub met them , they were starting over .
all right , baby girl , new deal .
usps change of address notices ,
people moving into florida and south carolina .
done .
all right , eliminate women , wives , couples .
narrow it down to men only .
so we &apos;re thinking divorced dad here , right ?
yeah , but not just any divorced dad .
this guy wants as much distance
between his son and his ex @-@ wife as possible .
so look for custody disputes , injunctions , allegations .
the messier the better , garcia .
i get you . i &apos;ll call you right back .
take it .
go ahead . give it your best shot .
like your father did .
gut it .
gut it !
i &apos;m getting it now , baby girl . that &apos;s our victim .
my beautiful ssa derek morgan , you deserve a raise .
gary rhymer of virginia just got full custody
after his wife failed drug test number 3 .
who &apos;s the child ?
his name is james . he &apos;s 15 .
enrolled to start school next week in mount pleasant ,
which is east of charleston .
looks like gary has a sister there .
how about how they &apos;re traveling ?
no . sorry , babe , there &apos;s no record of that .
just like the others .
thanks , doll .
none of the family members could confirm a train line for us .
so what do we do , we just rule it out ?
no . there &apos;s one person we haven &apos;t asked .
who ?
your aunt .
the train ?
did she ever mention it ?
no . she never told us anything . you said it was safer that way .
you know , when your uncle paul was still alive ,
he took the train to myrtle beach .
really ? what was the line ?
silver star .
cindi visited him once .
by train ?
yes .
auntie , that &apos;s a 36 @-@ hour @-@ trip .
how old was she ?
10 .
sometimes we want something so bad
that our minds will invent details .
but-
no , listen to me , pls .
i want to find cindi for you . believe me , i do .
but right now he has someone else &apos;s child ,
someone we can still save .
we can &apos;t afford to be wrong .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was just trying to help .
i know . i know . that &apos;s ok .
try to remember .
did she visit him ?
yes .
but she flew .
and i remember all the paperwork i had to fill out .
she was an unaccompanied minor .
james took the train 3 summers in a row
during his parents &apos; divorce .
his aunt from south carolina bought the tickets ,
filled out the unaccompanied minor paperwork ,
which is why it didn &apos;t show up in my search .
what &apos;s the train line ?
surf rider . it makes stops in jacksonville ,
charleston , and miami .
cross @-@ reference your list of boat owners
with railroad employees .
i got a hit on a last name .
chuck wells , local fisherman ,
son blake , conductor on the line .
and there it is . he didn &apos;t show up for work this week .
is there a current address ?
no . only a boat in the dad &apos;s name ,
which moved to norfolk in 2000
when the mom was diagnosed with breast cancer .
she died a few months later .
dad walked out and the unsub had to punish him for that .
james doesn &apos;t fit the victimology .
it doesn &apos;t make sense the unsub would take him .
he picked up on a father @-@ son relationship
that reminded him of his own .
what he didn &apos;t count on
was gary fighting for james &apos; life .
how do we know the unsub hasn &apos;t already killed james ?
so far he &apos;s only punished people
who &apos;ve abandoned their responsibilities .
but that &apos;s exactly what james is to him now , a responsibility .
the unsub &apos;s gonna get angrier and angrier at that kid ,
and when he does , he &apos;s gonna become more like his father .
i was just about your age when i started working here .
14 hours a day , every day .
that son of a bitch said i had to earn my keep .
and then he &apos;d beat me , he &apos;d take my paycheck ,
and he &apos;d drink it away !
get up .
garcia narrowed the unsub &apos;s history
with his dad down to two locations .
seaside pier , which is where chuck wells used to dock his boat .
all the locals do . it &apos;s the cheapest spot to tie off .
she also mentioned a cannery on st. john &apos;s river .
that place went out of business last year .
it &apos;s abandoned .
the dad brought his catch there
while the unsub worked the floor . started at 16,
which is roughly the same age as james .
all right , we &apos;ll split up . morgan , you take one swat team
and go to the cannery .
detective foreman and i will take the other
and we &apos;ll go to the docks .
we can be in both locations in 5 minutes .
one day i was late for work and my dad broke my arm .
and he told me to keep gutting .
and i cut and i cut
till i passed out .
now gut the fish .
yeah .
morgan , he &apos;s not here . i think you &apos;ve got him .
i see the boat , hotch .
let &apos;s go .
no , i won &apos;t do it .
pick up the knife .
or what ?
you gonna break my arm ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna slice your throat .
blake ! fbi !
stand down ! stand down ! do not shoot !
everybody stand down .
drop it .
drop the knife .
stand back . stand back !
ok . ok .
i &apos;m gonna put this away , all right ?
i just want to talk to you .
come on , man .
look at james . he &apos;s just a kid .
blake , you don &apos;t hurt kids . you &apos;re not that guy .
you have no idea who i am .
i know that you &apos;re a smart man .
you had a long run at killing under the radar .
but i also know that we can learn a lot from a man like you .
see , studying men like you is my responsibility .
and i &apos;m telling you , if you let james go ,
we can be a part of your life .
we won &apos;t abandon you , blake .
what makes you think i want to teach you ?
look at your alternative , man .
my guys are ready .
they will take the shot and they will kill you .
what happens after that , blake ?
do you really think you &apos;re gonna get to see your mom again ?
or maybe it &apos;ll just be cold ...
dark , empty .
like the water where you put your dad .
it &apos;s your choice , man .
get him out of here .
take him .
all right , blake , here &apos;s how it works .
we verify every word you say against forensics and records .
you lie to me , deal &apos;s off .
what do you want to know ?
let &apos;s start with how you abducted these victims .
carol reed .
oh , i could smell the fear on her .
oh , she promised me she would do anything
if i let her live .
your method of abduction ?
she was easy .
she was a meth addict .
i just told her i was holding .
alton mckee .
i caught him off guard .
he was running away from his nagging wife .
he couldn &apos;t stop calling her a bitch .
you &apos;re really enjoying yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
you making up for your loss ?
what loss is that ?
well , it must have really gotten under your skin
that they stumbled onto your perfect little hiding place .
not really .
how do you know i don &apos;t have a dozen more just like it ?
it &apos;s a big sea .
no .
blake , it &apos;s the same place where you dumped your own father .
he was the most important one ,
so you had to come back here and dump the other bodies .
i didn &apos;t dump her there , did i ?
she means something to you , doesn &apos;t she ?
they &apos;re all special to me , blake .
if you can &apos;t remember her , we can just move on .
i do remember her .
you want to know , agent morgan ,
who she cried out for
right before i made her slice her own throat ?
go ahead .
tell me .
you .
she cried out for you .
where were you ...
when she bled out on the floor of my boat ?
you are a sick son of a bitch .
but you didn &apos;t kill her .
i did kill her .
no .
you didn &apos;t .
and i was very clear about the rules .
deal &apos;s off .
i did kill her . you said you wanted to learn from me ,
and now you won &apos;t listen !
hey , come back here !
agent morgan !
i did kill her !
how did you know ?
he knows his victims &apos; names .
he didn &apos;t know cindi &apos;s .
agent morgan , you get back here !
agent morgan !
did you find her ?
no , auntie .
i &apos;m never gonna know , am i ?
he picked out her picture .
he did ?
thank you .
thank you .
&quot; we are tied to the ocean ,
&quot; and when we go back to the sea ,
&quot; whether it is to sail or to watch ,
we are going back from once we came . &quot;
