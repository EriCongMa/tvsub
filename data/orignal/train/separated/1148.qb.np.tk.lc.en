wait , that &apos;s not ian .
wren ?
what is he giving her ?
... &quot; if you continue as a rosewood &apos;s mvp ,
we can offer you a full scholarship . &quot;
this means you don &apos;t have to move !
em , did you write this letter ?
i found this on the doormat .
they want you on their team .
舍不得你走 艾米小老鼠 -a
honey , it &apos;s fantastic ! congratulations !
who &apos;s that ?
danielle .
well , does she know you &apos;re crushing on her ?
who &apos;s lucas ?
oh , my friend over there .
i &apos;m starting a new job .
who &apos;s it for ?
jason dilaurentis .
you can &apos;t work for him .
i need cash to buy tools and a truck .
i didn &apos;t leave without saying goodbye ,
so i wrote you a letter .
i &apos;ll never be able to forget that you were using me .
i &apos;m sorry .
we just got off the phone with your therapist .
she &apos;s recommending that you spend some time apart .
you &apos;re telling me that i can &apos;t see my friends ?
what &apos;s going on ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m looking for my ring . would you mind getting up ?
i &apos;ll be back for it on monday .
as soon as the banks open , i &apos;ll have the cash .
spencer !
take it . it &apos;s yours .
are you crazy ?
i &apos;m back .
huh . i &apos;m surprised .
um , here &apos;s my receipt for the ring .
oh ! sorry .
this place is skeevy .
she pawned her sister &apos;s wedding ring .
you &apos;re not gonna go to tiffany &apos;s .
so ... wren and melissa ?
weird , right ?
could you tell what he gave her ?
no . she didn &apos;t seem happy about it .
i wonder if ian will be .
how you holdin &apos; up ?
great . ever since i got that fake scholarship letter ,
my mom thinks i can do no wrong .
i &apos;m living a lie i didn &apos;t even tell .
leave it to &quot; a &quot; to make you feel bad
about your mom feeling good .
here you go .
horseshoe ?
is this some kind of a joke ? i @-@ i brought in a ring .
not according to the ticket .
you gave me that ticket 48 hours ago .
lot of people come through here in that time .
i need that ring back today ,
so i need you to get back down there behind that counter and find it .
or what ?
you ... want to call the police ,
talk to them about it ?
be my guest .
i can &apos;t believe that it &apos;s gone .
at least you got your money back .
am i supposed to give her this ?
i stole it-- i actually stole my sister &apos;s wedding ring !
&quot; just my luck-- diamonds are a girl &apos;s best friend . &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
所以放老实点
coffee is made , newspaper is in ,
and your father is putting breakfast on the table .
double @-@ berry pancakes .
wow ! we-- we haven &apos;t had those since ...
i know . i miss them .
it sort of feels like everything &apos;s finally
getting back to normal around here .
i like that .
so do i.
mike , breakfast .
i &apos;ll grab something later .
mike , on the other hand ,
may not be on the same page about me being back .
no , he &apos;s fine .
why shouldn &apos;t he be ?
at least he has a social life .
i know this not being able to see your friends
is probably really tough .
yeah , that &apos;s an understatement .
you do know that we &apos;re only doing this
because we feel it &apos;s best for you ,
for all of you .
now ...
what ?
how do i look ?
nice .
nicer than usual . why ?
because today is my first day ...
of being a full @-@ time teacher ! right !
sorry . i &apos;ve just been kind of ...
so , do they--
do they know what class you &apos;re gonna teach ?
i &apos;m taking over mr. fitz &apos;s class .
try and contain your enthusiasm .
no . i @-@ it &apos;s not that .
i &apos;m happy for you .
it &apos;ll be great .
going somewhere ?
no .
why do you have your passport ?
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not mine . it &apos;s ian &apos;s .
i need it for the insurance claim on my ring .
it still hasn &apos;t turned up ?
it will .
i &apos;d rather find my husband .
i &apos;ll be home after school ,
seeing as i can &apos;t hang out with any of my friends .
about that--
i was talking with spencer &apos;s mom yesterday .
and you realized that this whole bestie @-@ ban was a terrible idea ,
and i can hang out with them ?
no , we realized that you &apos;re the only one
who hasn &apos;t been to a solo session with your therapist yet .
so ?
so , your father and i think you should .
your friends have all taken it seriously .
i think it would be a good idea if you did too .
can &apos;t we just watch intervention and say that i went ?
stop . you &apos;re going . after school today .
my week &apos;s really shaping up .
i have a surprise for you .
what &apos;s that ?
well ... take a look .
who sent these ?
well , i would imagine it &apos;s
the scout you spoke to over at danby . who else ?
yeah . you &apos;re right .
somebody must really want you over at that school , huh ?
can i have some of those ?
have them all . i may never eat again .
ugh . the rat fall in the fry oil again ? &apos; cause last time ...
it &apos;s not the food . it &apos;s ... danielle .
yearbook danielle ? what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s right ?
ever since you helped me score a date with her ,
my stomach has been like a rat fell in fry oil .
i &apos;m completely off my game .
lucas , you don &apos;t have game .
whatever . i &apos;m calling this date off .
no ! no !
you cannot do that !
sure i can . i &apos;ll be doing both of us a favor .
i wouldn &apos;t have done this if
i didn &apos;t think you two would have fun together .
and fun is good , right ?
like , you enjoy fun , right ?
yeah , sure .
i mean ...
come with us on the date .
i hear it &apos;s gonna be a lot of fun .
and weird . haven &apos;t you ever heard the phrase &quot; three &apos;s a crowd &quot; ?
fine . don &apos;t come alone . you can bring caleb .
no . no , i &apos;m sorry . absolutely not . that &apos;s not happening .
come on , it &apos;s just one night .
you got me into this mess ,
and now you &apos;re gonna have to help me deal with it .
i &apos;m going this afternoon , right after school .
are you sure that &apos;s safe ?
no .
aria .
uh , can i talk to you for a second ?
we were-- we were just saying goodbye .
yeah , that &apos;s not what i want to talk to you about .
oh . okay . um ...
well , i would say you had really good mastery of the material ,
excellent eye contact with the students ,
but your handwriting could use some improvement , though .
yeah , that &apos;s not it either , but thanks .
um , mike left his keys at home today ,
and i &apos;ve got a faculty meeting after school .
can you take these
by his pickup game at the park after school ?
yeah , no problem .
thanks .
um ... and now that you mention it ,
the whole &quot; not seeing your friends &quot; thing
should probably extend to the school hallways , as well .
that date is gonna be a disaster .
well , you &apos;re his &quot; bro @-@ mate . &quot; help him out .
i tried , but he gets nauseous just talking about it .
and i &apos;m on the bottom bunk .
he has bunk beds ?
oh , and toys , in little boxes .
okay , they &apos;re collectibles .
you know he wants us to go with them .
i know . it &apos;s pretty lame , huh ?
yeah .
should we ?
no .
unless ...
seriously ?
the kid &apos;s gonna swallow his own tongue if we don &apos;t do something .
no , seriously , you &apos;re gonna go out with me ?
i &apos;m not going out with you .
i &apos;m accompanying lucas and danielle ,
and you happen to be doing the same thing .
we &apos;ll be his wingmen , or wing people ,
but that &apos;s it , you got it ?
got it .
good .
radiology , dial the operator .
radiology , dial the operator .
spencer , what are you doing here ?
we need to talk . i &apos;m sorry , this is kind of important .
could you ...
like , not be here right now ?
what did you give to melissa outside of our house ,
and what did she tell you ?
it &apos;s complicated .
okay , well , let me make it a bit easier for you .
ian tried to kill me .
what ? are you okay ?
for now .
but how about you tell me what you know
before he tries again ?
she wanted meds . supplies .
and you were just happy to hand them over ?
ian might be hiding out next door to my house .
no , melissa said he &apos;d only
tell her where he was once she had the drugs ,
but that it was somewhere outside of rosewood .
why did you help her ?
honestly ?
&apos;cause i feel partly responsible
for melissa charging back to ian .
how could i not help ?
i didn &apos;t give her everything that she asked for ,
some of the painkillers she wanted .
i &apos;d lose my job if i did that .
spencer , please , you have to believe me .
i had no idea that you were a part of this .
i don &apos;t want to see you get hurt again .
it &apos;s kind of too late for that .
you need to leave this alone .
i can &apos;t leave this alone .
and i need your help .
every time i gamble with you and your sister ,
people end up getting hurt .
i won &apos;t let that happen again .
wren , will you help me find ian or not ?
i &apos;m sorry . no .
it &apos;s amazing how slowly time passes
when you keep looking at a clock , isn &apos;t it ?
totally .
did you speak with your friends
about what it would be like coming in here on your own ?
we &apos;re not supposed to talk , remember ?
my guess is you find your ways .
you &apos;re best friends .
your opinions , your interactions ,
all are important to one another .
so why keep us apart ?
perspective .
sometimes when you &apos;re given an opportunity
to look at something from a different vantage point ,
you see different things .
what &apos;s the point of seeing things differently
if you can &apos;t share with your friends ?
hanna , i can help you .
help me what ?
let go .
i &apos;ve talked with a lot of young people about loss .
sometimes it &apos;s feelings of guilt that &apos;s holding them back ,
sometimes it &apos;s anger or fear ,
sometimes all three .
that &apos;d be really crazy , huh ?
no , not at all .
it &apos;s quite common .
alison is still here for you ...
for all of you , isn &apos;t she ?
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
maybe not .
but whatever you &apos;re feeling , you can move past it .
you make it sound like it &apos;s up to me .
you ... and alison .
i think you need to have a conversation with her .
it &apos;s a little late for that .
maybe not .
pretend alison is sitting here , right now .
i thought talking to empty chairs
was the kind of thing people come here to stop doing .
humor me .
what would you say to alison if you could ?
i &apos;d say time &apos;s up .
mike , it &apos;s me .
still wondering where you are , okay ?
um , i &apos;m at the park .
i &apos;m trying to give you your keys , so pick up .
mike !
hey , mike !
oh . sorry .
lewis . hey .
do you know where i can find mike ?
got me .
he usually plays here , though , right ?
not for the last couple of months , no .
no . no , no , no .
he usually plays pickup here .
almost every day after school .
so do we , and i haven &apos;t seen him . sorry .
hey .
hey .
you haven &apos;t seen my brother , have you ?
uh , no . sorry .
what , he give you the slip ?
something like that .
i was always lying about where i was when i was his age .
i don &apos;t remember a lot about that time , actually .
most of what i do remember , i wish i could forget , you know ?
you know what i do remember ? your pink hair .
really ?
i thought it was cool .
really ? !
really .
i mean , you-- you always did the unexpected ,
as opposed to me .
which ... i also thought was cool .
well , uh ...
hey ...
i miss that pink hair .
emily .
i saw the whole meet . you &apos;re so good .
thanks .
and i &apos;m even more impressed by that
commitment letter you got from danby .
how &apos;d you hear about that ?
from your mom , just like everybody else at the pool .
she is totally stoked , and so am i.
i mean , danby is a beautiful campus ,
and i could come visit , and ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , my god , you don &apos;t want to go to danby ?
or you don &apos;t want me to come to danby ?
no , it &apos;s not that .
that letter is not real .
the coach from danby didn &apos;t write it .
i ... i did .
wow , so you just mailed it to yourself ?
yeah . something like that .
emily .
great job , honey ! fantastic !
congratulations .
the field was kind of weak .
no , they were good , but you were better .
uh , mom , this is samara .
hi , samara . pam fields .
emily has told me so much about you ,
and it &apos;s nice to finally meet .
likewise .
you know , i sent video of your winning leg of the relay to your dad ,
and he was so excited .
you must be overjoyed .
why don &apos;t we have a celebration tonight ?
mom ...
i know inviting your other friends
probably isn &apos;t such a good idea right now .
right , so i don &apos;t--
samara , would you like to come ?
i &apos;d love to .
seven o &apos;clock ? okay , great .
i &apos;ll see you then .
relax .
if i &apos;m there and the truth slips out ,
your mom won &apos;t get so angry .
&quot; we &apos;ll be late . take care of your sister ... &quot;
exclamation point . &quot; mom . &quot;
that sounds like a fun evening .
melissa ?
you home ?
spencer ?
spencer ?
okay , so , if ian &apos;s not next door , where is he ?
and where &apos;s he going ?
and why is melissa going with him ?
right ?
things don &apos;t usually work out well for the wives of murderers .
do you ... do you think that he &apos;d hurt her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i wish i could just come stay over at your house .
me too .
i &apos;m home alone with the doors locked ,
and i &apos;m creeped out .
i gotta go . my parents are here .
okay .
mom ?
dad ?
boo .
hey .
hey !
what ?
where were you all day ?
what &apos;s it to you ?
well , i ... i was trying to find you all day to give you your keys .
so , give them to me .
no .
let &apos;s forget about today .
where have you been every other day , huh ?
because the guys you play ball with hardly remember what you look like .
places . here and there .
but ... but that &apos;s what you plan on telling mom and dad ?
you know that they &apos;re gonna find out .
not from you , they &apos;re not ,
&apos;cause if you tell them ,
i &apos;ll tell them about you and your friends sneaking around town
while you &apos;re supposed to be having a time out .
why are you doing this ?
mom &apos;s moved in . things are going back to normal .
you think that &apos;s all it takes ?
the four of us eat pancakes together ,
and everything &apos;s okay ?
things aren &apos;t how they used to be .
they never will be .
hey .
refill ?
thanks .
you two doing okay ?
great .
mm @-@ hm . fine .
okay , well , we have to leave for the movie in 10 minutes .
note to self :
it &apos;s a little too early to be channeling my inner mom .
it &apos;s a little late for that , anyway .
what are you talking about ? she &apos;s totally into him .
whatever you say .
maybe they have different mating rituals in yearbook club .
what are you , the expert now ?
i can read you pretty well .
well , trust me , it &apos;s going great .
this blows .
what ? i &apos;m having a good time .
are you ?
i would be . i like you ,
but ...
tell me you haven &apos;t noticed how she keeps checking you out .
hanna ?
uh , i don &apos;t think so .
she comes over here , like , every 20 seconds .
she &apos;s totally still into you .
well , then , why would she bring caleb ?
to make you jealous .
aren &apos;t you ?
no .
i would be .
that was my fifth birthday party , my first dive .
oh , look how cute you are .
oh , that was so long ago .
that was the best birthday ever .
i can &apos;t believe i wore my hair like that .
hi .
hi .
did you make this scrapbook ?
i did . one of many .
did you use a glue gun to stick the rice paper to the binding ?
what else ?
you know , that &apos;s the first thing i remember asking for for christmas .
i think i stuck myself to everyroom in the house
i still use it for some of my jewelry projects .
really ?
yeah , my mom and i ,
we made some scrapbooks like this when i was a kid ,
but they never turned out this well .
you know , i was thinking about making a new one ,
sort of along the lines of a rosewood @-@ to @-@ danby theme .
that &apos;s a great idea .
you know , em , you and i should probably take a tour of danby ,
just get the lay of the land .
yeah , there &apos;s plenty of time for that .
honey , it &apos;s never too soon to start doing a little bit of research .
actually , what i should do is call your scout
and talk to him .
mom .
honey , i &apos;ve got to call and thank him for the gifts , anyway .
the truth is ...
the truth is , danby has a good team ,
but so do a lot of other places .
my dad knows the coach at stanford ,
and they have a great team .
i was just telling emily that i think
a lot of different schools will be interested in her .
you think so ?
with her times ? totally .
i wouldn &apos;t get locked into danby .
play it cool , and wait for the other offers
to roll in during senior year .
that &apos;s when the real action starts .
if you contact the coach now ,
other places might get the wrong idea .
well , that seems to make a reasonable amount of sense .
em ?
um ... yeah . for sure .
you gotta help me , guys .
i &apos;m circling the drain here .
i feel your pain .
what are you talking about ?
danielle still thinks that you &apos;re crushing on me .
what ? ! no , i told her i was over you ,
and , just to be clear ...
okay , i get it , i get it .
but she doesn &apos;t .
do you know what it &apos;s gonna be like in yearbook tomorrow ?
they &apos;re gonna dedicate a special page
to how stupid i was to think that i could
go out with someone like her ,
and i &apos;ll have to design it .
i guess i was just kidding myself ,
thinking that i could let go of who everyone else thinks i am ,
and just be myself .
well , thanks for trying to achieve the unachievable .
you know what &apos;s a drag ?
is how much better lucas would be
if he didn &apos;t care what everybody else thought .
i know , right ?
what are we gonna do to help him ?
put your arm around me .
what ?
just put your arm around me .
nice work .
it was easy .
well , i &apos;m not .
melissa , i &apos;ve had second thoughts
about the injuries you &apos;ve described .
i &apos;m concerned ian could have a staph infection .
i &apos;m gonna have to insist that i see him before you go anywhere .
i &apos;ll bring whatever drugs are necessary .
no , melissa .
i come with you , or no deal .
she bought it .
she still doesn &apos;t know where ian &apos;s hiding ,
but she &apos;ll call me tomorrow when she finds out .
so i can go with her .
and i &apos;ll be right behind you .
please don &apos;t make me tell danielle that you &apos;re a peeping tom .
i won &apos;t .
i just wanted to come over and say thank you
for what you did last night .
you know , you &apos;ve come a long way from being one of alison &apos;s posse .
whatever .
no , seriously .
what you did , you did for me ,
and there wasn &apos;t anything in it for you .
that means a lot .
hanna ! your appointment isn &apos;t until next week .
i know , but ...
i need to talk .
hey , need a ride ?
used to be fun when i took you to school .
yeah . yeah , that &apos;d be great .
we &apos;re here for you , your mom and i.
you know that , right ?
yeah , i do .
okay .
and i &apos;m glad that the things that used to be fun
are becoming fun again .
me too .
hey , mike .
how was the game yesterday ?
great , like always .
aria watched for a couple of minutes .
yeah ?
want a ride to school ?
i &apos;m cool .
sure , i mean we could stop and get a ...
a cup of coffee .
is he okay ?
yeah , i think so .
all right . we &apos;ll leave in five .
okay .
what you said yesterday about seeing things differently--
um , i @-@ i went on a date .
a @-@ a double date .
actually , it wasn &apos;t even really ...
hanna . breathe .
you were right .
alison is still with us . with me .
more than i want .
why more ?
our friendship was work ,
like-- like you had to impress her
to make her like you , and ...
that meant doing things
that maybe you didn &apos;t feel so good about doing .
sometimes bad things .
if it was so hard , why was it so important to be her friend ?
she could make you feel special ,
and that seemed worth it then .
and now ?
what would you like to say to alison ?
just that ...
to alison .
alison ...
you were the best friend i ever had ,
and that meant a lot to me .
you meant a lot to me .
but you were also the worst enemy i ever had ,
and i can &apos;t believe it took me this long to realize that .
how do you think alison would respond to that ?
well , look at you .
all independent and in touch with your feelings .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re pretty impressed with yourself right now ,
aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
i &apos;m proud of you , hanna .
i don &apos;t care .
of course you don &apos;t .
today ...
you &apos;ve got doctor do @-@ over there ready to
pat you on the back
for talking to an empty chair .
i don &apos;t need her either .
well , you need someone .
low self @-@ esteem leads to &quot; hefty hanna . &quot;
wasn &apos;t that covered wellness class ?
i have other friends .
real friends .
you have what i gave you .
you think your three gal @-@ pals
will be with you forever , don &apos;t you ?
news flash : you &apos;re already losing them .
they &apos;re gonna move on , hanna , and you &apos;re not .
and you know who you &apos;ll be left with ?
me .
i &apos;ll always be with you .
i &apos;m the only one that can make you happy ,
the only one that &apos;ll tell you the truth .
i &apos;m the only one that you can count on .
then i &apos;d rather be alone .
you won &apos;t last a week .
at least i &apos;ll be alive .
you can &apos;t reach into my life anymore ,
not unless i let you .
you &apos;re gone ,
and i am so over missing you .
hey , you ?
have you transferred here without telling me ?
i thought about it .
no , i called you this morning ,
but i got your voicemail .
i wanted to see how you were doing
after last night &apos;s near @-@ miss .
okay , though i feel like i just postponed the inevitable .
maybe not .
i mean , what i said last night was the truth ,
except for the part about my dad knowing the coach from stanford .
but it was good advice .
and she was online this morning ,
checking every college with an endowment and a pool .
so it worked .
for now .
so , be happy .
for now .
with me .
&apos;least it gives us time for a second date .
wren .
melissa just called . she knows where ian is .
i &apos;m on the way .
spencer-- !
mom ?
we need to talk .
can it wait , because spencer--
i don &apos;t think it can .
i just got a call from dr. sullivan .
her office was broken into
after your last session .
it was completely trashed .
why would she call you ?
hanna , what did you and dr. sullivan talk about ?
isn &apos;t that supposed to be between me and her ?
i mean , that &apos;s how it works , right ?
was it something that somebody ...
might not want other people to know ?
we can &apos;t do this right now .
yes , you can . if dr. sullivan calls the police ,
they &apos;re gonna be asking a lot more questions than i am .
well , then , i &apos;m gonna need answers ,
and i &apos;m not getting them here !
hanna !
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
who else had keys to the office ?
no one . why ?
there aren &apos;t any signs of forced entry .
do we have a plan ?
working on it .
should we call garrett ,
tell him about ian ?
no .
the last thing we need to do is get him involved
in another mystery we can &apos;t explain .
that &apos;s what happens
when we &apos;re the girls who cried wolf .
i mean , don &apos;t you get it ?
we &apos;re screwed .
they &apos;re stopping .
there &apos;s no turning back now , right ?
i &apos;ve got 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on speed @-@ dial .
i &apos;ve only got one bar .
oh , crap . no bars .
we should take a photo of ian ,
prove we haven &apos;t been making this all up .
yeah , well , you go ahead and do that
while i try not to get killed .
sorry . i &apos;m just worried about melissa .
who knows what ian &apos;s thinking ?
or if he has a gun .
he &apos;s the bad guy , right ?
melissa !
