For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
Tell me about your ex, Katherine.
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
The Lockwoods are werewolves.
Tell me what triggers the curse!
You have to kill somebody!
Paralyzed from the waist down.
And dead.
Matt failed. I can't.
Tyler, what's happening?
Get away! Get away!
What's happening?!
We were stupid, sneaking around, thinking we weren't gonna get caught.
But it's over.
You need me. Elena's in danger.
She's the doppelganger. She needs to be protected.
Then I'll protect her.
Please, Damon.
No!
Where is she?
In the trunk. I did exactly what you said.
Good. Put her in the back.
Thank you for your help.
Is there anything else?
One more thing. Come closer. Please.
Closer.
Yo, Elena!
So, Sarah attacks Tyler, and he pushed her away,
And she tripped, and she fell, and she hit her head.
Does Matt remember anything?
Mmm, he thinks he blacked out.
Mmm. But I think--
I think they were both compelled by Katherine.
That's why I covered for Tyler and said it was an accident.
Yeah, I don't understand that. The guy's a tool.
Well, gee, duh.
Tyle's getting blamed for Sarah's death
just opens up questions that he can't answer.
And do you really think it's a good idea
for him to tell his mom he's a werewolf?
Well, no.
And that werewolf road leads straight to vampire boulevard.
I thought I was thinking fast on my feet.
Where's your mom?
Leading the search party for Aimee Bradley.
They haven't found her body yet.
Oh, teens today and their underage drinking. Tragic.
Wait. Did you see Tyler's eyes turn yellow?
More gold with amber highlights.
Can he turn into a wolf now?
Only on a full moon,
but now he has increased strength and who knows what else.
I wonder what Mason told him.
Does he know about us?
Hey. What'd you tell him?
Nothing, really.
I--I don't think he knows much of anything.
He seemed really freaked out, and honestly...
I felt kinda bad for him.
He's gotta know something.
All right. I'll ask him.
No, you won't, Caroline.
He cannot know about us.
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
So don't be his friend. Do you understand me?
I understand.
I'm late for school.
Right.
If you want to drop the hint to your mom,
Aimee's body is at the bottom of the ravine with a cracked spine.
Might save your mom some time.
Hey, Jeremy.
Look, Elena's gotta let me know
if I'm supposed to cover for her.
I mean, Jenna's cool with the two of you,
but you guys are pushing it.
What are you talking about?
You and Elena.
Look, I'm glad you guys are back together,
But if she's gonna sleep over--
Wait, wait.
Hold on a minute. We're not back together.
Wait. She didn't-- she didn't stay at your place last night?
No. I mean, I saw her at the party, but that was it.
She didn't sleep over.
'cause her bed hadn't been slept in,
And Mrs. Lockwood said that her car was still in the driveway.
Where is she, then?
Please.
What do you want?
Shh.
Please, I'm hurt.
I know.
Uhh. Just a taste.
Aah! Aah!
Trevor!
Control yourself.
Buzz kill.
What do you want with me?
My god, you look just like her.
But I'm not. Please, whatever you want--
Be quiet.
But I'm not Katherine.
My name is Elena Gilbert. You don't have to do this.
I know who you are. I said be quiet.
What do you want?
I want you to be quiet.
This has Katherine written all over it.
Katherine's in the tomb.
Trust me. I'm the one that shut her in.
Did you?
Did I what, Stefan?
Well, I know the hold that Katherine has on you.
She's in the tomb.
Period. End of story.
But she did say something to me
right before I shut her in.
I thought she was lying.
What did she say?
Elena's in danger.
What, and you didn't think you should ask her to elaborate?
Everything she says is a lie.
How am I supposed to know if she's gonna start spouting off the truth?
We have to go talk to her.
No, no. Let me tell you how that's gonna go.
We're gonna go ask her for help.
She's gonna negotiate her release,
which we're gonna be dumb enough to give her,
and then she's gonna get out and kill us.
That's exactly what she wants.
I don't really care.
Bad idea, Stefan.
It's Elena.
Caroline.
Hey. How are you doing?
Not good.
How's your mom?
My mom said that she was pretty freaked out
about everything that happened with sarah.
How did you know?
What do you mean?
About me.
How did you know?
Know what? That you were upset?
I thought I was doing a good thing by covering for you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Look, it was an accident.
Ok? And I've gotta run.
Just please don't blame yourself.
How's it go?
Still pass out.
You didn't touch her, did you?
Give me some credit.
So you called him?
No, Il called one of his contacts. You know how this works.
Look, Did you or did you not get the message to Elijah?
They say he got it.
Wonderful. And what?
So, that's it, Trevor.
He either got it, or he didn't.
We just have to wait.
Look, it's not too late.
We can leave her here.
We don't have to go through with this.
I'm sick of running.
Yeah? Well, running keeps us from dying.
Elijah is old school.
If he accepts our deal, we're free.
you!
There's nothing around here for miles.
If you think you're getting out of this house,
you're tragically wrong. Understand?
Who's Elijah?
He's your worst nightmare.
I can't undo the tomb spell, Stefan,
even if I wanted to.
It took both me and my grams to do it the first time.
All right, but I can open the door, though, right?
I could talk to her?
Yeah, but Damon's right.
She's not gonna tell you anything,
not without something in return.
I know. But, Bonnie, I have to do something.
I have no idea who has Elena.
I have no idea where she is.
What if there was another way to find her?
How does this work?
I'll use your blood to draw the energy for the tracking spell.
You're blood-related. It'll make the connection stronger.
All right, Alaric said we gotta clear out of here
within 10 minutes.
I got weapons. He stocked me up.
Are you ready?
There.
She's there.
That's 300 miles away.
No, Bonnie, we need a more exact location than that.
That's as close as I can get.
We can map it an aerial view.
It'll show us what's around there,
Help us narrow down the area.
Perfect.
Call me with whatever you find.
No, no.
I'm coming with you.
No, Jeremy, you're not.
I'm not gonna just sit here. What if she's hurt, ok?
Or worse? What if she's...
She's not. You two go back to your house just in case.
I'm gonna call you the minute I find her.
But you can't do this alone.
He's not. Let's go.
You're coming with me?
It's Elena.
Du, What the hell was that? Where did that come from?
How did you do that?
Hi, Tyler. Where you goin'?
Come on, man. Do what we got, play the game.
Hey. Um, are...You ok?
You lied to me earlier. Why?
Look. Tyler...
I think that you misunderstood me at the party.
I get it. It was very traumatic.
You're lying.
Nope. But I'm late.
How did you...
You're stronger than me?
Please. That was nothing.
Listen, if you know something, you gotta tell me,
Because I can't handle this.
I'm sorry, Tyler,
But I think that you're still in shock over Sarah dying.
And it's understandable.
Alaric likes his weapons.
What the hell is that?
Well, it's a vervain bomb or grenade launch
Or something like that.
Weird.
Hey, how much further is it?
About 80 miles.
Who do you think took her?
Someone from Katherine's past.
She said she was running from someone.
Maybe they got the wrong girl.
Thank you for helping me.
Can we not do the whole road-trip bonding thing?
The clich of it all makes me itch.
Oh, come on, Damon.
We both know that you being in this car
has absolutely nothing to do with me, anyway.
The elephant in the room lets out a mighty roar.
Well, it doesn't have to be an elephant.
Let's talk about it.
There's nothing to talk about.
That's not true. Sure there is.
Let's get it out. I mean, are you in this car
because you want to help your little brother save a girl that he loves,
Or is it.. is it because you love her, too? Hmm?
I mean, come on. Express yourself.
I happen to like road-trip bonding.
Keep it up, Stefan. I can step out of helping as easily as I stepped in.
Nope. See, that's the beauty of it.
You can't.
Alaric just left with jenna.
He's getting her out of the house for a while
so she doesn't ask questions about Elena. Look, I pulled this up
based on that spot on the map.
There's nothing for miles except for this old house.
Did you send it to Stefan?
Yeah.
I hate sitting here, waiting like this.
She's gonna be fine.
You don't know that.
No, I don't.
What are you doing?
I have something else I want to try.
I don't get it.
I need a candle. Grab Elena's hairbrush.
Ok, yeah.
What's all this stuff for?
I know it's crazy,
But I might be able to get her a message.
Bonnie?
Bonnie.
Bonnie. Bonnie!
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Why am I here?
You keep asking me these questions
like I'm gonna answer them.
Why won't you?
That's another one.
You got me.
Ok? It's not like I can go anywhere.
The least you can do is tell me what you want with me.
I personally want nothing.
I'm just a delivery service.
Delivery to who? Elijah?
Ah heh. 2 points to the eavesdropper.
Who is he?
Is he a vampire?
He's one of the vampires, the originals.
What do you mean, the originals?
Again with the questions. Haven't the Salvatores
Been teaching you your vampire history?
So, you know Stefan and Damon.
I know of them. A hundred years back,
A friend of mine tried to set me up with Stefan.
She said he was one of the good ones.
I'm more of a sucker for the bad boys, though,
but I digress.
Who are the originals?
Trevor and I have been running for 500 years.
We're tired. We want it over.
We're using you to negotiate ourselves
out of an old mess.
But why me?
Because you're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
Curse?
The sun and the moon curse?
Ohh. You do know your history.
What do you mean I'm the key?
The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
No. The moonstone is what binds the curse.
Sacrifice is what breaks it.
Sacrifice?
The blood of the doppelganger.
You're the doppelganger.
Aka, in order to break the curse,
You're the one that has to die.
Mom?
What are you doing here?
I know.
Breaking and entering the sheriff's house?
That move will win you an award.
Go ahead. Keep dodging.
Keep changing the subject.
But I know.
You're just like me. Aren't you?
No.
Keep it up, but I'm not buying it.
I saw how strong you were.
I'm not leaving here until you tell me the truth.
Tyler...
You're a werewolf. Say it.
What?
Stop lying.
I'm not lying.
Say it!
I'm not a werewolf. Ok?
Tell me more.
Captivity has made her pushy, eh?
What do you want to know, doppelicious?
Who are you running from?
The originals.
Yeah, she said that. What does that mean?
The first family--
The old world-- Rose and I pissed 'em off. Mm-mmm.
Correction-- I pissed them off.
Rose had my back. And for over half a millennium,
They've wanted us dead.
What did you do?
He made the same mistake countless others did.
He trusted Katerina Petrova.
Katherine.
The one and only-- the first Petrova doppelganger.
I helped her escape her fate.
And now I've-- sorry, we've--
been marked ever since.
Which is why we're not gonna make the same mistake again.
Here. Drink this.
Thanks.
What happened? You scared the hell out of me.
It's nothing.
It wasn't nothing, Bonnie.
I've been doing a lot of magic lately.
It wears me down.
When I'm worn down, I take a nap.
You were-- you were unconscious.
Witchcraft has its limits.
If I push too hard, it pushes back.
How do you know all this?
It's all in here.
It's like a reminder that I'm not invincible.
Please...
Don't--don't tell anyone.
Why not? Because it's a weakness,
And I don't want certain people to know that.
By certain people, you mean Damon.
I mean anyone that could hurt me.
I won't tell anyone, ok? I promise.
It's hard, you know?
My grams is gone, and my dad,
He doesn't want to know about what I am.
He hasn't since my mom left.
I'm all alone in this.
That's how I feel a lot of the time,
Alone.
Uh, you--you think that worked?
I have no idea.
We're gettin' close.
Jeremy said there's an access road
just past mile marker 6.
If you want some, just ask.
I want some.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Gonna be all big and strong
to save your girl. Well, don't worry.
I've got your back. You'll be fine.
I'm not joking.
I been drinking a little every day,
Slowly increasing my intake
and building up my strength.
Does Elena know you're drinking blood?
I've been drinking hers.
How romantic.
Since we're road-trip bonding,
Remember the days when all you lived for was blood,
You were the guy who would
rip someone apart just for the fun of it?
You mean when I was more like you?
Yes, Stefan. Exactly.
Back when you put blood into me
so I could be a big, bad vampire.
Wonder if Elena would be so quick
to open her veins to that guy?
By the way, what happened to that guy?
He was a hoot.
Guess he found something else to live for.
He's here.
This was a mistake.
No, I told you I would get us out of this.
You have to trust me.
No! He wants me dead, Rose!
He wants her more.
I can't do this. You give her to him,
He'll have mercy on you,
But I need to get out of here.
Hey. What are we?
We're family.
Forever.
You're scared.
Stay here with her
And don't make a sound.
Rose Marie.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
Yes.
In here.
You h-have to forgive the house.
Oh, no. What's a little dirt?
I completely understand.
So tell me,
What is it that gives you the courage to call me?
I wanted my freedom.
I'm tired of running.
You're in a position to grant me that.
I have complete authority to grant pardon
to you and your little pet.
What is his name these days? Trevor.
If I so see fit.
Katerina Petrova?
I'm listening.
She didn't burn in the church in 1864.
Continue.
She survived.
Where is she?
You don't seem surprised by this.
Oh, when you called and
invited me into this armpit of civilization,
Which is a mere 3 hours from the town we know as Mystic Falls,
I surmised it had everything to do with Katerina.
Do you have her in your possession?
No.
I have better.
I have her doppelganger.
That's impossible.
Her family line ended with her.
I know that for a fact.
The facts are wrong.
Well, show her to me.
Elijah, you're a man of honor.
You're to be trusted,
But I want to hear you say it again.
You have my word that I will pardon you.
Follow me.
Human.
It's impossible.
Hello there.
House should be just beyond those trees.
Wait. Now, I've got a little more experience
than you do with this sort of thing.
So what's your point?
My point is whoever has Elena
is probably who was after Katherine in 1864 and before that.
And?
And it puts them at 500 years old and strong.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Yeah, I'm certain I wanna do it.
'cause we go in that house,
We might not come back out.
All right. Then I won't come out.
So noble, Stefan.
I can't think of a better reason to die.
But go on and stay here.
I'll totally understand.
Well, we have a long journey ahead of us.
We should be going.
Please, don't let him take me.
One last piece of business.
Then we're done.
I've waited so long for this day, Elijah.
I'm truly very sorry.
Oh, no, your apology's not necessary.
Yes. Yes, it is.
You trusted me with Katerina...
And I failed you.
Oh, yes, you are the guilty one,
And Rose aided you
because she was loyal to you.
That, I honor.
Where was your loyalty?
I beg your forgiveness.
So granted.
You--
Don't, Rose...
Now that you are free.
Come.
No, what about the moonstone?
What do you know about the moonstone?
I know that you need it,
and I know where it is.
Yes.
I can help you get it.
Tell me where it is.
It doesn't work that way.
Are you negotiating with me?
It's the first I've heard of it.
What is this vervain doing around your neck?
Tell me where the moonstone is.
In the tomb underneath the church ruins.
What is it doing there?
It's with Katherine.
Interesting.
What is that?
I don't know.
Who else is in this house?
I don't know.
Move!
Rose.
I don't know who it is.
Up here.
Down here.
Excuse me.
To whom it may concern,
you're making a great mistake
if you think that you can beat me.
You can't.
You hear that?
I repeat--
You cannot beat me.
So I want the girl
on the count of 3,
or heads will roll.
Do we understand each other?
I'll come with you.
Just please don't hurt my friends.
They just wanted to help me out.
What game are you playing with me?
Just let her go.
Hey, come here. Are you hurt? You ok?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Elena?!
Are you ok?
I'm ok.
I'm ok.
I got your message.
Where's Elena?
She's home.
And you're here why?
Because she wanted to be with Jeremy.
Here.
Thanks.
Listen, uh,
what Rose told Elena about the curse...
I know. We'll keep her safe.
You know the only way we're gonna be able to do that is
if we're not fighting each other.
We let Katherine come between us.
We let that happen with Elena,
we're not gonna be able to protect her.
Yes, Stefan.
Heard it all before.
What?
I'm sorry.
About what?
For being the guy who made you turn 145 years ago.
Enough, Stef. It's late.
We don't need to rehash that.
You know what? I've never said it out loud.
I guess I just need to say it,
and you need to hear it.
I'm sorry.
What I did was selfish.
I didn't want to be alone.
Guess I just needed my brother.
You know what? This sounds crazy,
but alcohol helps.
Or at least it helps me.
You know, with all that inside jittery stuff.
I'm hot.
It's like my skin is on fire.
Really?
I never had any of that.
Guess wolves are different.
At the beginning, I was very, very emotional.
Everything was heightened.
I have that.
How can you be a vampire?
How can you be a werewolf?
Who else is like you?
Just me.
It's a really long story.
We can share another time.
Uh, how many other werewolves are there?
Just me.
And my uncle Mason,
but he left town.
Look, Tyler...
You can't tell anyone, OK?
Not about you, not about me.
No one will understand.
I know.
I want to tell you about my mom and yours
and the founding families and the council,
but I need you to promise me
no one will find out about us.
This is life and death, Tyler.
I have no one else to tell.
I'm sorry about earlier.
It's just-- I'm alone with this.
It's gonna happen to me.
On the next full moon, I'm gonna turn,
and I won't be able to stop it.
I'm scared.
Tyler.
No, it's all right.
Who's there?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Why are you here?
Lexi once told me that you're one of the good ones.
You knew Lexi?
Trevor was my best friend.
For 500 years, I have lived with one person,
and he's gone.
And I don't wanna run anymore,
because I don't have anybwhere else to run to.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I don't need your help,
but I think you need mine.
Elijah may be dead, but this isn't over.
What do you mean it's not over?
It isn't over.
The originals, they'll come for her.
They have to.
They're doing it for him.
For who?
Klaus.
Cute PJS.
I'm tired, Damon.
Brought you this.
I thought that was gone.
Thank you.
Please give it back.
I just have to say something.
Why do you have to say it with my necklace?
Well...
Because what I'm about to say is...
probably the most selfish thing I've ever said in my life.
Damon, don't go there.
No. I just have to say it once.
You just need to hear it.
I love you, Elena.
And it's because I love you that...
I can't be selfish with you...
Why you can't know this.
I don't deserve you...
But my brother does.
God, I wish you didn't have to forget this.
