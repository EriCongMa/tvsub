第五季 第八集
well , that one diner has the best bacon .
so i don &apos;t know .
great bacon .
please , god , we &apos;re entering minute 20
of the great brunch debate .
the other diner does have that special fruit cup .
other diner . fruit cup . let &apos;s go .
however , when i think about it ,
huge crowd looking for that special fruit cup .
smart .
so now we got to think line versus bacon .
please , i am starving . make a decision .
do you guys want to join us ?
we are going for brunch in seven days .
hybrid meals are for people who are too lazy
to wake up for a proper breakfast .
besides , we &apos;re looking for a wedding venue today .
good luck with these two ,
because if they get really hungry ,
then all bets are off .
curveball-- maybe we roast a turkey .
have either of you ever made a decision in your lives ?
i make decisions all the time .
what &apos;s the last decision that you made ?
first of all , you got to make a decision
if you gonna make a decision .
you know what i mean ?
of course we make decisions .
how do you think i &apos;m wearing clothes right now ?
i laid those out for you , nick .
but i decided to let you .
this is your whole problem .
imagine how much better your life would be
if you could just make a decision .
she &apos;s just mad
because she had a bunch of dumb brunch ideas ,
you damn fool .
okay . uh , well , what about this ?
i will sleep with one of you tonight
if you can just decide who .
are you ... are you serious ?
i mean , we &apos;re talking about a one @-@ time thing
and you can &apos;t get weird afterwards , but , yeah , i &apos;m ...
down for , like , a fun half hour .
and you would be there ?
yes .
you would physically be there ?
yes .
can it ... be nice ?
well , that &apos;s on you . let me know by 9 : 00 .
what if we die before then ?
there &apos;s not much i can do about that .
okay , you know what , you know what ,
we &apos;ll discuss this amongst ourselves . i mean , uh ,
nobody wants to see how the sausage is made , am i right ?
no , they don &apos;t . to the sausage factory .
what ?
that &apos;s not what i meant .
yeah . let &apos;s go .
all right .
thank you for the opportunity .
good luck with your decision .
at what cost ?
one sexual barracuda to another ,
i see what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re doing it for the story .
you want to see how deep the abyss goes .
you want to look that monster straight into the eye .
maybe it &apos;s so bad that it &apos;s good .
but it &apos;s not good . it &apos;s b ... it &apos;s bad .
okay , honey , calm down .
she &apos;s not actually gonna do it .
no , i &apos;m trying to teach them a lesson .
this isn &apos;t an &apos; 80s summer camp movie .
i &apos;m not gonna sleep with somebody based on a bet .
i &apos;m just ... i was just kind of playing along
with the whole thing just in case
they were listening at the door .
something about &quot; summer camp moogie . &quot;
&quot; summer camp moogie . &quot;
no , no , no . i got nothing .
this isn &apos;t real , right ?
it can &apos;t be .
i mean ... i mean , it can &apos;t be .
why would it be ?
but on the off chance that it is ,
we need to take this extremely seriously .
you &apos;re absolutely right . okay , okay . well , what do you suggest ?
we do a gentlemen &apos;s debate .
a gentlemen &apos;s debate .
we calmly discuss who merits this opportunity
and we come to a decision based off respect and politeness .
i agree . so ...
please proceed , sir .
thank you , sir .
you &apos;re welcome , sir .
okay . the gentleman knows that i have a monster crush on reagan .
but because this is such a powerful argument
in my favor , i politely take it off the table .
in that case , the gentleman politely ...
thanks you .
the gentleman was sure that the other gentleman
would not be such a jerk
and let his friend &apos;s dreams come true .
perhaps i &apos;m not dealing with a gentleman at all .
perhaps i &apos;m dealing with a dingus .
did you call me a dingus ?
you &apos;re acting like a dingus .
how can i be a dingus when you &apos;re the damn dingus ?
you &apos;re the dingus .
you &apos;re the d ...
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re ...
you are ...
looking forward to sex later .
well , that makes three of ...
that makes two of us .
well , get ready for the skin circus , you little peanut .
okay .
i was put in an awkward situation ,
and i reacted poorly .
everything rides on this decision .
you know , the venue is the axle of the wedding chariot .
i know that you have dreamed about this day
since you were a little boy , but we are paying for this out
of our own pocket , okay ? so we cannot get carried away .
okay .
yeah .
oh , i see ...
okay , this could work .
oh , my god . no . oh !
some tea lights and flowers
and this place could be nice .
it &apos;s like a mumford &amp; sons music video , yeah ?
is there hay in here ?
we &apos;re looking for the vacant warehouse for the wedding venue ?
vacant warehouse ? they &apos;re closing us down .
we &apos;re all getting fired .
grab what you can !
hey , you guys , kind of not cool .
you were supposed to text me before you got here . okay .
can everyone just take a seat , please ?
can you just stop t ...
hey , you ...
me owe you ? you ditched me
when we were supposed to run away from home together .
i built that raft for nothing !
we could do this all day , but i have actual feelings for her .
i thought you said feelings were off the table .
well , i &apos;m putting &apos; em back on the table .
i &apos;m gonna settle this right here , right now .
do it .
cindy ...
no .
... de la garza .
oh . huh , so look at me .
look at me . let it affect you .
you knew i had a crush on cindy de la garza ,
and you frenched her anyway .
frenching ! they &apos;re frenching ! they &apos;re fren ...
chaperone !
they &apos;re frenching !
i had dibs on her since the fifth grade , dude !
if i could un @-@ french her , i would .
you owe me this .
i knew that french was gonna haunt me .
you called dibs ... and i screwed up .
what you gonna say ? what you gonna say ?
it &apos;s you .
oh , yes . man , that girl better get ready
for some kind , attentive lovemaking .
hey , uh , have you guys seen my purple sweater ?
uh , no . and , by the way , we &apos;ve made our decision .
wow . that was fast . you have until 9 : 00 .
we don &apos;t need it .
you &apos;ll be having winston .
that &apos;s me . i &apos;m winston .
great . don &apos;t eat for two hours before .
i &apos;m really looking forward to it .
bring your a @-@ game , okay ?
any previous injuries that i need to know about ?
bring something to numb your mouth .
oh . look .
the sweater was in my hand the whole time .
you know , this woman requested my a @-@ game .
my a @-@ game . maybe it &apos;s hopeless that i could even
please this woman sexually . what am i thinking , winston ?
just focus on yourself .
concentrate on yourself sexually , winston .
no , winston , that is not your way .
i just want to head off any discussion of what your way is .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m just feeling a little insecure about my body
and the way it is connected to my face .
bishop ...
you have nothing to worry about .
really ?
yeah .
okay . what &apos;s my best feature ?
instant regret . instant .
the second i said it , i was like ...
if you had to pick .
fine .
you have very nice ...
that &apos;s our suspect .
what ?
he &apos;s taking off !
okay , i &apos;ll let you take point on this one ,
because i got to protect my duke for later .
oh , you suck so much .
has that park always been a pet cemetery
or were just crazy people burying a dog there ?
well , i &apos;m not even close to giving up .
why don &apos;t we just pop in here ?
oh , really ? we just &quot; happened &quot; upon the lisbon , schmidt ?
purely a coincidence that we ... made it just on time
for the appointment that i made a month ago .
why are you doing this to yourself ?
ah . mr. schmidt .
may i offer you a beverage ?
perhaps an organic cucumber vodka spritzer ?
yes .
it is so beautiful .
i feel like i &apos;m inside cate blanchett .
we get that a lot .
i &apos;ve got to say , i &apos;m pretty impressed
with how quickly you guys came to that decision .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause you don &apos;t know how mature we are .
you see , winston had dibs
on cindy de la garza since the fifth grade ,
i frenched her in the eighth grade , so ...
so about 20 years
ago winston had a three @-@ year @-@ old dib ,
he never acted on it , and now you &apos;re the bad guy ?
oh , reagan .
first of all , dibs can &apos;t be singular ...
i mean , if anything , it &apos;s kind of a story
about how indecisive winston can be .
well , no , it &apos;s a story about ...
but you guys came to a decision-- i &apos;m proud of you .
uh , can i ... can i practice my presentation on you ?
sure . but i &apos;m bored already . okay .
this stuff &apos;s really boring for me .
for everybody , i guess . hmm .
hepatitis c can be a long ...
arduous experience .
but now
discover zilpoza from wudai pharmaceuticals .
fda approval ...
pending double @-@ blind study .
if you &apos;ve had cirrhosis
or kidney disease ,
zilpoza ...
may not ...
be right ...
for ... you .
you think i &apos;m a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy ?
i know what you &apos;re doing .
what am ... what am i doing ?
you &apos;re trying to lead me on , and i won &apos;t have it .
case closed ! you &apos;re having winston !
great , i &apos;m having winston .
it &apos;s so juvenile , what you &apos;re doing .
a dib is a dib .
oh , god , if i keep looking at the ceiling , i &apos;m gonna cry .
damn it , we are getting sucked in-- we have to leave immediately .
it &apos;s probably not even available .
there &apos;s no way , right ? i mean ...
you &apos;re right .
philip .
quick question .
look , we realize that you guys book up
decades in advance , so please just let us know
that you don &apos;t have any slots available .
actually , you &apos;re in luck--
shia labeouf had to cancel
his solitaire tournament ,
and we have one open slot , in april .
in april ?
mm @-@ hmm .
all right , babe , no . no , no , no ,
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you need to breathe . we &apos;re just gonna enact the plan
that we set up for when you see an ankle boot
you really , really , really like , right ?
what do we do ? we walk away ...
and if i dream about it in the middle of the night ,
then it &apos;s meant to be .
we &apos;re gonna walk away , philip .
thank you so much for all your help .
i should let you know , however ,
there is another interested party .
what ? schmittyballs ?
b ... b @-@ benjamin .
okay .
you &apos;re engaged ?
mazel to you , sir .
hey , meems ,
this is the , uh , fat guy from school
we used to make dance for chocolate .
in all fairness ,
benjamin would peg chocolate at my head
while i was already dancing .
he what ?
benny @-@ boo ,
i don &apos;t want to lose the lisbon to these fat people .
the hell ?
don &apos;t worry ,
schmidtstain can &apos;t afford the lisbon .
unless , of course ,
they accept gift certificates from fat camp .
benjamin , i still ... i mean ... i can ...
do they do that ?
i &apos;m a different ...
we &apos;ll have to ask somebody about that .
okay , that is it !
we ... are booking the lisbon .
we are ?
go !
no .
i &apos;ve never loved you more , cece !
what were you gonna say ?
what is that in reference to ?
it &apos;s been silent for 30 minutes .
earlier , you were gonna tell me what my best feature was ,
and then we got distracted .
right . by crime .
i could tell you what yours is .
oh , my god , please don &apos;t .
you have a lovely neck .
really ?
not my knuckles or , like , the skin behind my ears ?
okay , do me . it &apos;s my turn .
come on , come on , come on , come on , i need this .
fine .
i will tell you ,
but then we drop it immediately and forever .
drop .
you have kind eyes .
really ?
i have kind eyes .
i &apos;ll take that .
you know , i always thought i had snail eyes .
&quot; immediately and forever , &quot; remember ?
i &apos;ll turn around .
turn around .
i @-@ i &apos;ll save my kind eyes for last .
okay .
hello ?
i &apos;m reopening the reagan decision .
wait , what ?
i already took my supplements .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m telling her
we &apos;ve decided , and it was me .
oh , no , you are not ! i hear shaving .
are you shaving ?
no !
i know what that means .
hello ? hello , nick ?
damn .
just go .
you mean it ?
thank you very much , aly .
i am going to win this sex bet !
we want to get married at the lisbon .
we want to book the lisbon right now !
uh , start by filling these forms out .
it &apos;ll be pleasure .
yeah , no problem .
what &apos;s our routing number ?
69364278 .
just gonna give benjamin a little coffee--
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
hey , come on ,
she can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no , she did that .
the service is so gorgeous .
really great .
you do realize
we &apos;re not gonna decide this on who writes the fastest .
you know , here at the lisbon ,
we celebrate grandeur , and romance .
oh , you are schmidt out of luck , schmidt .
our wedding &apos;s gonna be sick romantic .
our wedding &apos;s gonna be way romantic , bro .
quiches so small you got to wear glasses .
bitch , we &apos;re gonna have more white linen
than a hospital in the great war .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna have so many fresh cut flowers
that you &apos;re gonna have a real bee problem up in this bitch .
we &apos;re gonna have spanakopita so flaky ,
you &apos;re gonna get crumbs all over your mouth , like , what ?
our tables are gonna be names of cities
that we &apos;ve been to , like , what ?
our wedding is gonna be so ... big ...
that the giants will come to town
and everyone gets a big spoon .
philip , you @-@ you want romance ?
let me tell you the story about
how i knew that mimi was the one for me .
the story is called &quot; lovestruck . &quot;
there &apos;s a title ?
it was our fourth date ,
and we had just seen toy story 3 for the second time .
maybe it &apos;s just us ,
but we love pixar .
we &apos;re nerds .
i reach for mimi &apos;s hand ,
and i was struck by lightning .
i mean , literally ,
yeah . zap .
i was struck by a bolt of lightning , philip ,
and i ... i would &apos;ve been killed
if mimi hadn &apos;t grounded me .
we met ... crying
over the same name
at the vietnam memorial .
george ...
harrison ...
ford .
wha ... ?
who was our grandfather .
what ?
making us cousins ?
making us cousins , because there is
nothing more romantic
than forbidden love .
between family members ? i mean , that &apos;s ...
you &apos;re gonna double down with that ?
yes , i am .
he &apos;s writing &quot; cousins &quot; down .
that &apos;s a positive thing .
no , it &apos;s not .
hey . what are you doing , man ?
we had a decision .
the decision wasn &apos;t valid--
your dib on cindy was expired .
okay , first of all dibs don &apos;t expire .
also , dibs-- not singular .
and how are you still shaving ?
i &apos;m doing full body , winston .
i started from the bottom , now i &apos;m here .
that &apos;s gross .
i &apos;ve been doing sex prep all day .
i did a hundred girl push @-@ ups .
i washed my feet until the water ran clear .
you can clean your feet all damn day-- it don &apos;t matter ,
because i &apos;m having sex with reagan tonight .
the decision &apos;s been made .
well , the decision &apos;s been changed ...
i &apos;m having sex with reagan .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
it is gonna happen .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
no , don &apos;t ...
got it !
what were you going for ?
the cologne .
i smell so pretty !
give me ... give me my col ...
no . no , no , no . no .
oh , god ! aah !
what are you doing ! aah !
i don &apos;t know , man !
you got frickin &apos; cologne all over me .
i smell fantastic !
oh , my god .
we got to turn the tables on reagan ,
make her decide .
i don &apos;t see her going for it , man--
the entire point was that we had to make a decision .
well , then i guess we &apos;re gonna have to trick her ,
and i know how .
we &apos;ll up your fee by $ 10,000 .
ten thousand and one dollar !
uh , cece , we don &apos;t have $ 10,000 .
we barely have the one .
ten thousand and two dollars !
it &apos;s not your turn to bid .
$ 15,000 !
$ 15,000 ...
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not worth it .
it &apos;s not worth it .
yeah , but it &apos;s your dream .
i ... i know .
but i already have my dream .
it &apos;s marrying you .
it &apos;s all yours , benjamin .
yes !
&quot; i have my dream . &quot;
dumb !
they remind me of my stupid grandparents
on their 60th anniversary .
old .
reagan .
let me guess . you guys made a final decision ?
please . sit .
that &apos;s probably the first time you &apos;ve been right all day ,
but yes , we have made a decision .
great .
here &apos;s the deal , reagan .
it &apos;s 2016 , you &apos;re a lady .
your decision is important to us .
yes , we want you to decide
which one of us is most attractive to you ,
and if that person is the same name
that &apos;s on the piece of paper in this envelope ,
then sexual relations can commence .
okay , well , the logic is bulletproof .
i just feel like if i &apos;m gonna be making this decision ,
i need you guys to pitch yourselves .
for starters , i &apos;m completely hairless ,
okay .
except for a straggler near one of my nipples ,
because i got scared while shaving .
in my fantasies , i &apos;m a wild lover .
in real life , my sexual prowess has been described
as &quot; fine , &quot; &quot; adequate . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;ll get the job done . &quot;
that is both a lot and a little ,
but either way , a tough act to follow .
winston , you &apos;re up .
well , that &apos;s easy .
i &apos;ve got kind eyes .
you don &apos;t have kind eyes .
you have snail eyes . everybody knows that .
i &apos;ve got kind eyes . aly told me so .
who &apos;s aly ?
yeah , she &apos;s my partner at work . i complimented her first ,
told her she had a very nice neck , which she does .
but what i should have said was ,
&quot; you got a really cool chin , &quot; or &quot; you got some dope earlobes . &quot;
honestly , everything about her is great .
and when i &apos;m with her ,
i never really notice time .
it &apos;s probably because she is the best part of my day .
i should ... i should have told her one of those things ,
as opposed to the neck thing , you know .
then she told me i had kind eyes .
you like aly .
yes .
she &apos;s my partner .
winston !
come on , it &apos;s obvious . you like aly .
i @-@ i like her . i @-@ i like aly .
oh , my goodness !
why did i never think of that before ?
wow , my mouth is dry .
anybody else &apos;s mouth dry ?
what should i do ? i don &apos;t know what to do .
i don &apos;t know what to do . what should i do ?
winston , this is cindy de la garza all over again .
you need to make a decision .
i got to ask her out .
good ! go !
go ahead ! go ! good luck !
listen , reagan , i am so sorry ,
but obviously , we will not be making love tonight .
no . it &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;m sorry . i got to go .
well , i guess that leaves just old nick miller .
mm . your room or my room ?
well , both rooms have a lot of interesting possibilities .
that &apos;s a heck of a question .
your , um ...
give me 15 minutes , and i &apos;m gonna come back
and tell you which room and why from my opinion ,
and then , you can give me yours , and we can discuss .
just give me one second , and , uh , i &apos;ll be good to go .
i just need ... two minutes tops .
you stay there .
aw , no !
oh , that &apos;s a lot of blood .
damn .
well , you &apos;re back , and you have an insane look in your eyes ,
so ... congratulations ?
no , i didn &apos;t do it .
i was , uh ... you know , i thought about it .
oh , i don &apos;t need to know .
uh , yeah .
yeah ...
would you like to go out after work , grab a drink with me ?
sure .
sure .
all right then .
oh . uh , can my boyfriend come ?
your boyfriend ? yeah .
yeah , sure !
how long have you guys been ... ?
yeah , it &apos;s new .
it &apos;s new . it &apos;s new . it &apos;s ...
he &apos;s an agent , actually , for ... animal actors ?
what am i gonna say ? no .
he should stay at home and not exist , please .
no , i won &apos;t say that .
officer down ... to meet your boyfriend .
i realize those were a poor choice of words for a station .
nick !
it &apos;s almost 9 : 00 .
are we doing this or what ?
what is that ?
you look like you &apos;re in a boca raton street gang .
i didn &apos;t think you were actually gonna go through with it ,
and even if you were ...
i made a decision .
i wouldn &apos;t want it like this .
so i decided to put on my i &apos;m @-@ not @-@ having @-@ sex tonight outfit ,
&apos;cause no one &apos;s gonna have sex with me in this outfit .
and now i &apos;m gonna go out
and have a drink .
would you like to come ?
wow . deciding nick .
let me change .
fyi-- your i &apos;m @-@ not @-@ having @-@ sex @-@ tonight outfit
is leopard print and tight .
i don &apos;t know if you know that .
it &apos;s animal print , but it &apos;s not tight .
these are baggy , fuzzy pjs with a flap on the butt .
exactly my point . you want to see what &apos;s in the envelope ?
it &apos;s a blank piece of paper .
you &apos;re so wrong .
does that look like a blank sheet of paper ?
very clever .
thanks , yeah . i thought of it
when i was getting tickets to the world series of chili
and had to prove that i was human .
we &apos;ve got big news , you guys .
champagne all around .
we &apos;re getting married in a ...
soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ abandoned warehouse !
yeah . champagne .
oh , thank you .
and i &apos;ll even give you one .
hey , guys , aly is on her way to the bar .
with her boyfriend .
well , you know , everyone dies .
oh , that &apos;s the worst .
maybe he &apos;ll die .
i &apos;m sorry , winston .
is there anything we can do to cheer you up ?
uh , no .
anything that would make you feel better ?
anything ?
anything ?
well , if you insist , then .
you asked me what i wanted . this is all want .
all right , let &apos;s do it , let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s just do it .
let &apos;s do it .
okay , let &apos;s go .
