i &apos;ve got terrible news .
what &apos;s going on ?
before i tell you , perhaps i should soften the blow .
you &apos;re face is pleasingly symmetrical .
just tell me .
a swedish team of physicists
is trying to scoop our super @-@ fluid vortex experiment .
oh , well , that kind of stinks .
&quot; that kind of stinks &quot; ?
why aren &apos;t you more upset ?
did i soften the blow too much ?
because this here is more like a picasso painting .
what are we going to do ?
perform the experiment immediately .
i &apos;d love to , but we need liquid helium
and our shipment &apos;s on back order for a month .
a month ? what ? are you kidding me ?
that would have been a good time for you to soften the blow .
that shirt brings out the blue in your eyes .
thank you . aren &apos;t you sweet .
let &apos;s go check to see if the university
has any helium in reserve .
did you know that i almost didn &apos;t wear this shirt today ?
hey , barry , we &apos;re in trouble .
we need liquid helium--
does the department have any we can use ?
sorry , there &apos;s a shortage .
and what we do have i need for my quantum excitation study .
but you won &apos;t need much for that .
true , but if it &apos;s successful ,
i &apos;m having a party with balloons .
come on , barry , there &apos;s a swedish team
trying to run our experiment before us .
can &apos;t you spare any ?
be honest-- if the shoe was on the other foot ,
would you do this for me ?
yes .
no chance .
what are you doing ?
he said be honest , so i was honest .
didn &apos;t your mother tell you ? it &apos;s the best policy .
so , what do you say ?
hell no .
he could &apos;ve softened the blow .
why do you need kripke ?
can &apos;t you just go to party city for helium ?
we &apos;d have to go to every party city in california .
sounds like you on cinco de mayo .
在节日当日会有各种派对 舞蹈等等
hey , people were still talking about that party
on siete de mayo .
leonard , if that swedish team beats us ,
i will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again .
which is a shame , because swedish meatballs
are my favorite toothpick @-@ delivered meatball .
if you need liquid helium so bad , i know a guy
who can get you some , if you don &apos;t ask too many questions .
who is he ?
where does he work ?
how does he get the helium ?
how many questions are too many questions ?
maybe he &apos;s not for you .
four questions . there answer &apos;s four .
hey , you know who went out on a date the other night ?
stuart .
oh , good for him .
i thought so , too .
so is she , like , homeless , or framing him for a crime ?
he &apos;s using some kind of dating app on his phone .
oh , which one ?
maybe we can get amy to try it .
i don &apos;t know .
stuart , can you come in here ?
he tried to explain it to me .
it shows you pictures of people nearby ,
you swipe them around , it looks kind of like a game .
oh , and if you lose the game , you have to go out with stuart .
what &apos;s up ?
can you show us that dating app ?
oh , yeah , sure .
this thing has changed my life .
wow . so how many girls have you met ?
two .
i probably don &apos;t need to mention
there &apos;s an entire number between that and zero .
well , so how does it work ?
uh , well , it @-@ it shows me all
the single women in a five @-@ mile radius
who are using the app .
if i like the way they look , i hit &quot; thumbs up . &quot;
if i don &apos;t , &quot; thumbs down . &quot;
oh , what would make you give a girl a thumbs down ?
first time it happens i will let you know .
oh , hey . i just heard back from the liquid helium guy .
what &apos;s he say ?
he &apos;s got what we need and can meet us tonight .
oh , really ?
you know i don &apos;t like buying things at night .
january 7 , 2009 .
i went to the ralph &apos;s at 11 : 30pm to pick up
cracklin &apos; oat bran for the morning and what did i see ?
the man restocking the cereal shelves .
that &apos;s right . and what did he do ?
he handed you the box directly and called you stretch .
it &apos;s like it was yesterday .
do you want liquid helium or not ?
of course i do .
i don &apos;t want that swedish team scooping us .
then i &apos;m going to tell him we &apos;re in .
leonard , wait . this is highly unethical .
we &apos;re just bending the rules a little .
we have grant money to do the experiment ,
so we &apos;re going to spend it on the helium we need .
it &apos;s not like when dr. goldfarb
claimed he bought an electron microscope
and he was really just keeping
a russian girl in an apartment in van nuys .
was she helping him with his research ?
sure .
so , are we doing this ?
okay , but where does he get the helium ?
remember ? don &apos;t ask too many questions ?
uh , but this is violating university code .
a little , but ...
if i may quote einstein ,
&quot; the pursuit of science calls us
to ignore the rules set by man . &quot;
all right , do it .
tell him we &apos;re in .
done .
i can &apos;t find that quote on the internet .
did you make that up ?
before i answer ,
may i just say your skin has never looked better .
aren &apos;t you just made of sugar .
i &apos;m not sure how i feel about this .
oh , come on , just let him put the app on your phone .
yeah , stuart got two dates with it .
one of which would &apos;ve ended in sex had she not said no .
okay , all set .
okay , let me see .
nope , nope ,
nope ...
oh , he &apos;s cute !
doesn &apos;t a teardrop tattoo
mean he murdered someone ?
and he &apos;s sad about it .
hey , i thought you were gonna be out late ?
if you wanted me to stay out later ,
you should &apos;ve given me more spending money .
what are you guys up to ?
we put amy on a dating app ,
and we &apos;re seeing what &apos;s out there .
oh , fun ! let me see .
uh , no ...
no , uh , definitely not .
what was wrong with that guy ?
uh , he &apos;s indian .
we &apos;ve already got one of those .
ooh , we should find a nice latino .
it really round us out .
hey , i want to try .
uh , excuse me , c @-@ can i have my phone back ?
hang on , i &apos;m trying to find you the next great love of your life .
the man who will father your children .
okay , yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks ?
that must be him .
oh , of course .
an nondescript , white panel van .
you may be familiar with it from the sentence :
&quot; their bodies were found
in a nondescript , white panel van . &quot;
what &apos;s up ?
uh , i &apos;m leonard .
this is my friend--
i &apos;m skippy .
skippy cavanaugh .
great .
you got the cash ?
uh , yeah , uh , right here .
wait , hold on , hold on .
how do we know that you &apos;re not gonna
take the money and drive away ?
what ya doing , skippy ?
exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us .
you give us the helium first .
oh , how do i know you &apos;re not gonna
drive away without paying me ?
guess i &apos;m not the only one
who watches &apos; 70s television crime dramas .
look , you can trust us .
we &apos;re respected scientists .
well , he is .
i &apos;m a wedding planner ,
who can &apos;t find love himself .
it &apos;s ironic , but the point is
we can &apos;t trust you .
you &apos;re a sketchy character in a parking garage .
yeah , well , from my perspective ,
that &apos;s how you two appear to me .
well , i never thought of it like that .
boy , frame of reference will just sneak up on you , won &apos;t it ?
my friend does make a decent point about the money .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable just handing it over up front .
ah @-@ ah @-@ ah , no money , no helium .
seems we &apos;re at a , uh , stalemate .
not technically .
in chess , a stalemate refers to a situation
in which there are no remaining moves .
uh , you have plenty of moves available .
you could beat us up and steal the money .
you could kill us , you know .
really , you &apos;re only limited by your imagination .
all these years , i &apos;ve been using &quot; stalemate , &quot;
when i really mean &quot; impasse . &quot;
i feel foolish .
i don &apos;t think it matters if this is a stalemate
or an impasse or a mexican standoff .
率先让步的局面
what are we gonna do here ?
oh , whoa , whoa , how can it be a mexican standoff ?
everybody knows you need three sides for that .
not necessarily .
uh , many argue the essence of a mexican standoff
is that no one can walk away from the conflict
without incurring harm .
hmm , i don &apos;t follow .
let me give you an example .
earlier today ,
i decoded the headers on your e @-@ mail ,
and i know that your name is kenneth fitzgerald .
from that , i figured out where you live and where you work .
now , to make this a mexican standoff ,
i would say something like , uh ,
&quot; you give us the helium or i &apos;ll turn you in to the authorities . &quot;
is that a threat ?
yeah , exactly . see , you &apos;re getting it .
yeah , well , i know where you work , all right ?
and if you mess with me , i &apos;ll report you ,
then i &apos;ll pound your asses into the ground .
perfect ! now we really are in a mexican standoff .
is this one of those times
where i &apos;ve won the battle but lost the war ?
afraid so , skippy .
i told you we shouldn &apos;t go shopping at night .
all right , let &apos;s all just calm down .
nobody wants to report anybody .
no , i don &apos;t like this . i &apos;m out .
no , no , no . wait , don &apos;t go .
just let me explain .
we &apos;re physicists , and we &apos;re trying to prove a hypothesis
that we &apos;ve been working on for over a year .
really ? what &apos;s the hypothesis ?
space @-@ time can be interpreted as
the surface of an n @-@ dimensional superfluid .
could be , could be .
go on .
okay , but now there &apos;s this swedish team that read our paper
and they &apos;re trying to beat us to our own discovery .
we really need this helium .
and i &apos;m sorry i lied about
being a wedding planner who can &apos;t find love .
although i am currently single , if you know anybody .
here &apos;s the money . can we do this ?
okay .
it &apos;s a shame about those scientists ripping you off .
i expected a higher ethical standard
from our friends in sweden .
it &apos;s actually pretty common in our field .
not much you can do about it .
well , for the right amount of money ,
if you know where they live ,
there &apos;s , uh , plenty we could do about it .
did you hear that , leonard ?
there &apos;s plenty we could do about it .
do you have a card ?
okay , here we go .
now everyone can see .
all right .
where do we stand on cross @-@ eyed mike ?
you know he won &apos;t be looking at other girls .
unless they &apos;re sitting on the end of his nose .
okay , okay , okay . thumbs down .
next .
ew , check out his tiny teeth .
he looks like a man @-@ dolphin .
wait , if he &apos;s good in bed , she can throw him a fish .
i love you , amy .
okay , i &apos;m starting to feel guilty .
aren &apos;t we being a little mean ?
that &apos;s a fair point .
we wouldn &apos;t make fun of someone like this to their face .
look , it &apos;s stuart !
you may want to leave the room .
right this way , uncle harvey .
will you stop with that already ?
i &apos;m trying not to attract attention .
and tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn &apos;t do that ?
she said , &quot; buenas noches . &quot; what was he supposed to do ?
let &apos;s just start the experiment .
leonard , we should probably have our story straight
in case we get caught .
we &apos;re not getting caught .
well , you can &apos;t be sure of that .
what if the helium dealer rats us out ?
what if kripke asks where we got it ?
what if the university checks my family tree
and finds out i don &apos;t have an uncle harvey ?
the dealer doesn &apos;t care , kripke has no authority over us ,
and you being related to a metal container
would explain a lot .
help me hook this up .
what ?
well , did you see this sticker ?
what is it ?
it &apos;s partially torn off , but the segment that remains reads :
&quot; property of &quot; and the letter &quot; u. &quot;
it &apos;s probably usc or ucla .
yeah , but what if it &apos;s &quot; property of u.s. government &quot; ?
there &apos;s a national helium reserve in amarillo , texas .
if this was stolen from there ,
we &apos;re accessories to a federal crime .
let &apos;s not jump to conclusions .
a lot of things start with &quot; u. &quot;
that &apos;s true .
there &apos;s the u.s. air force ,
u.s. department of defense , u.s. navy ,
&quot; you &quot; and i are going to jail .
listen , we can do the experiment as planned
and beat the swedish team to the punch ,
or we can kiss our dreams good @-@ bye
because we were to afraid to break a few rules .
ma &apos;am .
okay , does everyone remember the rules ?
if he &apos;s shirtless , one sip .
posing with a pet , two sips .
pet and shirtless , chug like it &apos;s your job .
and pull !
i have that same underwear !
chug !
mm , amy , you &apos;re getting a text .
oh , um , give me that .
&quot; i had a great time last night . &quot;
no , no , st @-@ stop reading that .
who &apos;s dave ?
i ...
you went on a date last night ?
are you seeing someone ?
no , it @-@ it &apos;s not like that .
&quot; and i &apos;d love to take you out again &quot; ?
amy !
what ?
can &apos;t believe it .
oh , my god .
okay , it &apos;s like that .
thank you for coming back .
yeah , well , normally i wouldn &apos;t ,
but my daughter &apos;s having a sleepover , and there &apos;s only
so much screaming and katy perry a man can take .
颇受小女孩到青少年女性喜欢
anyway , if you could just give us our money back ,
you can have your helium and we &apos;ll be on our way .
yeah , well , is there something wrong with it ?
no , nothing . we just changed our mind .
he has glasses and i &apos;m a know @-@ it @-@ all ;
we are not built for prison .
yeah , i hear you .
well , you &apos;re good guys , so i &apos;ll , uh ...
i &apos;ll take the helium off your hands .
thank you .
but you ain &apos;t getting your money back .
you &apos;re taking advantage of us ?
we clarified nomenclature together .
look , i enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy ,
but , uh , this is business .
you know what ?
it &apos;s fine . keep the money .
we just want to be done with this .
no problem , but i am gonna have to charge you
a small helium restocking fee .
i don &apos;t understand .
he wants more money .
well , it better not be more than a thousand dollars ;
that &apos;s all i &apos;ve got on me .
that &apos;s exactly how much it is .
finally ,
something breaks our way .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re seeing someone
and we don &apos;t even know about it .
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t you tell us ?
because it &apos;s new and weird
and i &apos;m just trying to figure it all out .
and i knew if i told you guys
i had been out with a few people
that you &apos;d get way too excited about it .
a few people ?
what ? !
amy !
so , are we allowed to ask how it &apos;s going ?
it &apos;s going fine .
it &apos;s mostly just been meeting people for coffee .
wha ... ? !
i thought we were all ...
never mind .
i @-@ i thought you weren &apos;t ready to start seeing people .
well , i don &apos;t have much experience dating ,
so i decided it would be good for me
to , you know , get out there a little .
well , good for you .
thank you .
and how many guys have you gone out with ?
please be less than two .
three .
damn it .
well , the swedes might beat us ,
but at least we won &apos;t get gang @-@ noogied in prison .
is ernest goes to jail the only prison movie you &apos;ve seen ?
it scared me straight , leonard .
hey , i &apos;ve been thinking .
i was being petty .
you can have my helium .
thank you , barry .
but you have to add my name to your paper .
that &apos;s preposterous .
i don &apos;t know , seems fair .
you can &apos;t do it without me .
can you give us a minute ?
take your time .
i &apos;ll walk out backwards for dramatic effect .
i don &apos;t like being extorted like this .
especially by him of all people .
me neither , but what other choice do we have ?
i promise this is the last time .
it &apos;s says right here on the wikipedia
&quot; a mexican standoff is a confrontation between
at least three parties . &quot;
how can you trust wikipedia
if they use &quot; between &quot; to refer to three parties ?
they should &apos;ve used &quot; among , &quot; right ?
or &quot; amongst , &quot; if they were feeling whimsically archaic .
all right , enough with the chitchat .
are we gonna watch ernest goes to jail or not ?
absolutely .
but don &apos;t be surprised if this movie sets you
on the straight and narrow .
i am open to change .
