and he &apos;s wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it .

this is a perfect day .
i &apos;m sorry , everyone , but i can &apos;t do this .
and it &apos;s not because of the horse .
or the badger .
or &quot; cotton @-@ eyed joe . &quot;
this isn &apos;t what i want .
what i want is to be with someone else .
shivrang , i feel terrible . i &apos;m sorry .
no ... no , cece , it is okay .
in fact , it &apos;s more than okay .
i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t tell you the truth ages ago ,
but ... but i want to be with someone else , too .
really ?
yes .
i have tried to forget you , elaine-- really , i have--
but i just can &apos;t .
who the hell is elaine ?
and i don &apos;t care what my family says .
i want to marry you in a presbyterian church .
oh , shivvy .
i &apos;ve loved you since the first grade .
and i &apos;m so lonely without you .
i just lay awake at night ,
and i just write about you in my journal ,
and i paint pictures of you on my easel .
i want our children to be photographers
and ... and backpack across europe .
will you take me away from this madness ?
and you are not too short for me .
i don &apos;t care what your mother says .
oh , elaine !
come !
let &apos;s go to vegas and elope !
i feel slightly rejected .
well ... you were slightly rejected .
yeah .
you okay ?
well , i &apos;m not as good as elaine .
who could be ?
i feel better than i &apos;ve felt in a long time .
good . i &apos;m glad .
boobies .
i don &apos;t think the badger &apos;s actually rabid .
i think , um ... he &apos;s just kind of a dick .
so ...
hey , nick .
you okay ?
me ? yeah .
you mean from the fall ?
yeah . and ... what we talked about .
yeah . look , jess , it &apos;s not ...
you know , that big of a deal .
and we tried . it &apos;s just ...
you might be right about your fears , you know , it &apos;s ...
just ... just say it .
i @-@ i think we should call it , you know ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re in love or anything .
we had one night .
okay , let &apos;s call it .
i think that feels good to me .
does that feel good to you ?
but you must have feelings for her .
you tried to sabotage her wedding .
i sabotaged her wedding as a friend .
i didn &apos;t want her to marry someone else as a friend .
it &apos;s only romantic because it &apos;s a wedding .
i would be just as happy to sabotage , i don &apos;t know ...
let &apos;s say , her tax audit .
schmidt .

but can ... can we sleep on it , maybe ?
maybe take the night ?
i &apos;ve got ...
i just got this brand @-@ new coldplay bootleg .
