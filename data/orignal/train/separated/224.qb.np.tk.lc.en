your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
my meeting was about
transferring her back to her new york office ,
and i want you to come with me .
you weren &apos;t even the last one to kiss her before louis . i was .
the last person she was with before she left was me .
there &apos;s not a woman in this room who didn &apos;t take some pleasure
in your downfall , myself included .
how about working for me instead ?
the newspaper &apos;s just the cornerstone
of what i hope is gonna be a new media empire .
i wrote a novel . no one was supposed to see it ,
but then vanessa found it and sent it to a publisher ,
so i need to find out which one .
but isn &apos;t being published a writer &apos;s goal ?
not for this book . it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a scathing social satire
about everyone i know .
have you not told louis because it might be chuck &apos;s ?
i can &apos;t be this close to having all my dreams come true
only to have them yanked away .
look , i know it &apos;s scary ,
but i think you should know who the father is .
and what if i lose everything ?

they say the only way
to conquer your fear is to face what you fear the most .
you must walk into the belly of the beast ...
and risk the possibility of failure .
but try to hide from the fear ,
and you risk it swallowing you whole .
go away . i &apos;m preparing for my interview with &quot; hello ! &quot; magazine .
but doctor office call again .
they have test results .
hang up , or i &apos;ll tell the reporter
you &apos;re undocumented .
we have problem .
doctor &apos;s office call four times
to say paternity test ready for pickup .
miss blair say she busy ,
but reading grace kelly biography all day
is not busy . is denial .
when does louis get back from his trip ?
tonight .
and miss blair had promised us that she find out
who baby daddy is before prince louis get home .
all right , i have a couple things to do this morning ,
but when i &apos;m done , i will march her
to the doctor &apos;s office myself if i have to .
miss serena , welcome home !
dorota , i &apos;m so happy to see you .
we missed you so much .
i go tell miss blair you are home .
okay .
whoa . that is not the look of a girl
in an empire state of mind .
last week at grandma &apos;s was great ,
but i don &apos;t know . i think it was a mistake to come back .
stop worrying about your mom .
cece won &apos;t tell a soul you &apos;re here ,
and she promised to call my mom
to make sure she doesn &apos;t say anything either .
but even if that &apos;s true ,
what about blair or dan or everyone else ?
i don &apos;t think they &apos;ll be thrilled to find out
the psychotic freak is back in town .
please , this place is a mecca for psychotic freaks .
everyone goes off the rails at some point around here .
it &apos;s practically a rite of passage
on the upper east side .
it &apos;s our version of a bat mitzvah .
well , maybe for someone who &apos;s from here , but me ...
you a rhodes ? you &apos;ll be fine .
i suffer through mediocre sex with an editor &apos;s assistant
to find out who &apos;s publishing your book ,
and this is how you thank me ?
chuck , you felt nothing after &quot; field of dreams , &quot;
so i &apos;m taking it to the next level .
if that movie can &apos;t make you feel ,
then maybe this little guy can .
the only thing this mongrel makes me feel is disgust .
take it back to the pound , or i will .
sorry . i have a meeting .
i gotta kill this book once and for all .
i have to see my old mentor noah shapiro .
it &apos;ll take some persuading , but i think it &apos;ll help .
i have some knee pads in the bedroom if you need them .
i think simple conversation will do the trick , but thank you .
whoa . who &apos;s this little guy ?
he &apos;s chuck &apos;s new , uh--
drunken mistake . never sleep with a girl from p.e.t.a.
what , did we have plans or something ?
is that why you &apos;re here ?
no , no , i &apos;m just here to wish you good luck on your first day .
good luck .
thank you .
remember to walk the dog .
what , are you gonna keep him ?
of course not .
well , you should . you might need a new buddy .
i won &apos;t be around much between school
and my new job at &quot; the spectator . &quot;
you do know this is not the kind of job
you should get from a chick at a hollywood party .
diana &apos;s completely rebuilding the paper ,
and even though i &apos;m only an intern ,
she says there &apos;s a lot of opportunity to move up .
nathaniel , you and i both know the only reason
this woman &apos;s hired you is so you can please her in the bedroom ,
not the boardroom .
now ... if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to call victor , get this thing ... out of here .
mmm ! yum .
you &apos;re back !
oh , i thought i &apos;d lost you to the land of pole dancing classes
and gluten @-@ free foods .
i am back , and look who i brought with me .
okay . and why ?
she &apos;s hit a rough patch with her mother .
you know how that is .
i thought maybe she could stay in the guest room
until we figure things out .
i &apos;ll allow it . welcome back .
well , thank you for letting me stay at your place .
i love your apartment .
oh , you should have seen the place
i found charlie living . &quot; squalor &quot; is too nice a word .
but now you have heated bathroom floors
and the future princess of monaco
as your landlord . speaking of which , b. ,
where &apos;s your prince ?
cologne for a charity event . he &apos;ll be back tonight .
which is why miss blair must be going .
many things to do before he returns .
like possibly find a new maid .
an employee with one child is annoying .
two is grounds for termination .
oh , my gosh . dorota , i forgot . congratulations .
thank you . i must say ,
best part of pregnancy is knowing who father is .
sorry to eclair and run , ladies ,
but i have an interview today ,
and i need to go over my talking points .
wait . no , no . does this mean you &apos;re not going
to the jenny packham show tonight ?
we were finally invited to model together .
well , as much as it pains me ,
i guess you &apos;ll have to storm the catwalk without me .
bisous , mes cheres .
now time to do thing you swore
to mr. humphrey you do before prince home .
if you mean shopping , absolutely .
see ? i told you . that went great .
now that you &apos;ve survived blair ,
let &apos;s go talk to my mom .
i can go prime her first
so it &apos;s not too big of a surprise .
you can unpack and have the car bring you there after .
she will welcome you with open arms . you &apos;ll see .
so dan humphrey wrote an actual novel .
yeah .
and i was confident you &apos;d remain an epic disappointment .
well , i never intended to publish &quot; inside . &quot;
somehow it fell into
simon &amp; schuster &apos;s laps anonymously ,
and since they &apos;re your publisher ,
i was hoping you could get the book killed .
it &apos;s a satire of my entire life
and everyone i know , and if it &apos;s released ,
i &apos;ll be a pariah .
my , you turned out to be an even bigger coward than i thought .
the best way to make sure your book fades into oblivion--
leave it alone .
what , let it come out ?
have you seen what &apos;s on the best seller list ?
unless you &apos;re friends with rizzoli and isles
or related to a bounty hunter ,
no one will give a crap about your world .
you &apos;ll be lucky if your book
makes it into the remainder bin at strand .
trust me . let it come out , and vanish .
没去拿化验单 -多洛塔
ready to go ?
dan humphrey ,
alessandra steele ,
my agent .
nice to meet you .
you , too .
um , well , if you really think it &apos;s best for me to do nothing ,
then that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do . thank you .
and please don &apos;t tell anyone .
wait outside a second .
i need to call my old friend jonathan karp .
i should go . i &apos;m gonna be late for my panic meeting .
you okay ?
yeah .
with eric gone , it &apos;s pretty lonely .
i feel like all i do is play &quot; angry birds &quot;
and grill larissa for gossip .
well , there &apos;s only one more month ,
and serena &apos;s back today .
ohh . mwah . true . it &apos;ll be so good to see her .
carol , i am so glad you called .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ve been out of touch .
have you heard anything from charlie ?
no . why ? is everything okay ?
she &apos;s taken off , and i think she might be on the west coast ,
and mom &apos;s not returning my calls .
have you spoken to her ?
a few times ,
but serena &apos;s back from los angeles ,
so i &apos;ll see if she &apos;s heard from charlie .
serena was in l.a. ?
yeah . mm @-@ hmm .
listen ... why don &apos;t i fly up ?
it would be really good for me
to be around family right now anyway .
sure . come . um , i could definitely use the company .
and in the meantime , i &apos;ll let you know if i hear anything .
okay . bye @-@ bye , sweetie .
did you pick up the test results ?
i &apos;m just opening the door to the doctor &apos;s office .
i &apos;d better hang up , though .
it &apos;s so rude to talk on the phone ...
turns out that the rumored u.e.s. novel
is fact , not fiction ,
and i have the inside scoop on who the author is .
patience , pets . your answer &apos;s coming .
right now the median age of this paper &apos;s readership is over 50,
and its online presence all but nonexistent .
they don &apos;t even have an app , for god &apos;s sake .
so ... first course of business is rebranding .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m having the paper
sponsor the jenny packham party tonight .
show we &apos;re a little more glamorous now that i &apos;m here .
so where can i start ?
how about by making me scream ?
what ? right here with a full office ?
i mean , the staff might think you &apos;re playing favorites .
besides , i don &apos;t like an audience .
excuse me . can i have everyone &apos;s attention ?
you &apos;re all fired .
don &apos;t bother cleaning out your desks .
good luck .
产科 &amp; 妇科医生
all right . come on . hey , take a deep breath .
let &apos;s open that bad boy .
what ? ! here ?
the results of this test could alter the course of my life .
you want me to face that in front of pigeons
and--and street vendors ?
you said yourself that the odds are in louis &apos; favor .
and he will be an amazing father .
but ... what if it &apos;s chuck &apos;s ?
i know .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll open it ,
immediately after my interview with &quot; hello ! &quot; magazine .
i can &apos;t face the press if i &apos;ve just heard unsettling news .
i need to look like grace kelly ,
not grace coddington .
i have to manage some business of my own ,
but go do your interview .
i &apos;ll meet you back at your apartment ,
and we can open it then .
that is much more civilized ...
unlike your hair , humphrey .
you look like a muppet .
oh , the whole summer was amazing ,
but getting the job with jane made it feel
like it all happened for a reason , you know ?
i start setting up her new york office tomorrow .
oh , that is so wonderful , sweetheart .
i am so proud of you .
by the way , have you heard anything from your cousin ?
i got a call from carol this morning , very concerned .
i guess charlie might have run away to los angeles .
grandma didn &apos;t call you ?
so that &apos;s what she was calling about .
look , carol was cutting her off ,
and by the way , charlie &apos;s 19 .
so it &apos;s not like she &apos;s running away .
she &apos;s just leaving home .
i know , but your grandmother should not be lying to carol .
after all , charlie has had sade serious mental health issues .
mom , i saw her myself . she &apos;s fine , i promise .
well , that &apos;s not for you to decide .
carol is her mother ,
and i &apos;m not gonna participate in deceiving her .
sorry , charlie , but it looks like your upper east side dream
just turned into a nightmare .
when i interviewed prince louis for this article ,
he said that family &apos;s very important to you .
that &apos;s one of the many things he loves about you .
he said that ?
so ... what about the two of you ?
when will you be starting a family ?
oh , well , that &apos;s a very personal question .
we can skip it .
anyway , your fiance answered for you .
according to him ,
it &apos;s a long way off .
&quot; blair hasn &apos;t expressed an interest in being a mother yet ,
and i &apos;m nowhere near ready to be a father
at this point in my life . &quot;
is it the translation ? i &apos;m quite sure it &apos;s accurate .
no . i &apos;m sure it is .
you have your answer .
well , thank you for your time .
i &apos;m sure the two of you will be very happy .
alessandra , hi . i &apos;m , uh--
dan humphrey . i &apos;m good with names .
if you &apos;re looking for noah , he &apos;s not here .
i just came by to grab some of his things .
do you know when he &apos;ll be back ?
he won &apos;t .
well , i really need to talk to him .
i confided in him a personal matter ,
and he--he might have-- he might have said something
he wasn &apos;t supposed to say .
yeah , i promise you , he doesn &apos;t have time
for petty gossip right now .
his hands are full with the release of his new book .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i have a lot to deal with .
he didn &apos;t mention anything about a book
this morning when i saw him .
nobody knew about it , not even me .
noah submitted it secretly
because he wanted his editor &apos;s honest reaction .
i would kill him if the book wasn &apos;t so brilliant ,
and i &apos;m only on page 60 .
it &apos;s called &quot; inside . &quot;
oh , hold on a sec .
yeah . the reservation &apos;s for tonight .
club a steakhouse .
ask noah if he wants anyone else there .
look , i will make sure that
you get a signed copy when it &apos;s released .
it &apos;s about people your age .
you &apos;ll love it .
poor lonely boy .
you just learned the true meaning
of publish or perish .
hey , max , it &apos;s me , ivy .
i think i made a big mistake .
i should have come with you to portland .
so i , uh , got a bus ticket ,
and i &apos;ll see you as soon as i can .
i hope you can forgive me .
hey . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m leaving .
i heard what your mom said .
wait . so you showed up at her place after all ?
but , charlie , i can turn my mom around .
i &apos;ll go back there right now .
it &apos;s not your mom . it &apos;s mine .
she doesn &apos;t want me in new york .
being here is like a dream come true ,
but ... maybe she &apos;s right . i don &apos;t belong here .
just because you weren &apos;t born here
doesn &apos;t mean you don &apos;t belong here .
i &apos;m sorry , serena .
thanks again for everything .
hey , um , if you really are leaving ,
could you do me a favor and , uh , return my tickets
to the jenny packham show ? it &apos;s ...
already bad enough that
i canceled being a model so last minute .
i think that if i let my tickets go to waste ,
they &apos;ll never invite me back .
of course . it &apos;s the least i can do .
thank you . call me from l.a.
disaster averted .
andre leon talley got everyone in a panic
about leaking images of
jenny packham &apos;s show
on his twitter tonight .
they were gonna cancel the party .
i suggested that no one be allowed to bring their cameras
into the party or even their cell phones ,
and now the show &apos;s back on .
care to celebrate ?
i &apos;d love to celebrate .
in fact , i love celebrating with you
as many times a day as possible .
but i &apos;m just starting to wonder if that &apos;s all you hired me for .
and you know what ?
i think my mom could still get me the job
with the senator .
oh , you &apos;re not serious .
and why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
i came to work for you so i could establish myself
outside of my family &apos;s influence .
now if this just some big joke to you ,
i might as well take an internship
that looks good on my resume .
this is no joke ,
and i &apos;m sorry if i made you feel that way .
sit down .
do you know walter mccreedy and his wife nola ?
congressman mccreedy ? of course .
i play squash with him at the club sometimes .
she &apos;s a famous socialite . he &apos;s a hot young congressman .
they &apos;re gonna be at the show tonight .
i want an interview with them .
and since you fired all your actual reporters ,
you &apos;re willing to let me do this ?
this is how you learn .
dorota , pick up my dresses at the tailor .
i &apos;m going to the jenny packham party .
but you have date with prince louis tonight .
and mr. humphrey on his way over to help with letter opening .
mention that name again , and you &apos;ll be exiled
to work the rest of your days
in someplace horrible , like the upper west side .
you know what happens to housekeepers there .
the zabars zombies .
82号大街东882号
oh , excuse me . i &apos;m here to return
serena van der woodsen &apos;s tickets .
good . you &apos;re here . come with me .
oh , wait . you don &apos;t understand . let me explain .
so this is the dress that you &apos;ll be wearing tonight .
we &apos;ll need to make some tiny adjustments ,
but that &apos;s what tape and pins are for , right ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i think there &apos;s a misunderstanding .
i &apos;m not serena . i &apos;m just here to drop those off for her .
right . you &apos;re her cousin , charlie rhodes .
have some champagne while you wait .
how about it , charlie ?
one last cinderella moment
before you turn back into a bumpkin .
hello , my love .
put that depressing russian literature down
and get dressed . i &apos;m taking you out .
i wish . i would do anything to go to a party right now ,
but don &apos;t let me stop you . if you wanna go out , go out .
you &apos;re not the one under house arrest .
neither are you . you know all of those meetings i &apos;ve been having
with panic about the new album ?
well , half of them weren &apos;t with panic .
they were with your lawyer .
i wanted to see if he could convince the judge
to grant you an early release .
i just got the call .
you are officially a free woman .
oh , my god . rufus , is this for real ?
100 % . your ankle monitor was deactivated an hour ago .
so i thought we could go to that fashion show to celebrate .
an actual event where i don &apos;t have to tend the bar myself ,
with people i &apos;m not related to ,
and--and clothes i didn &apos;t order online ?
rufus , oh , you must really ...
love me , don &apos;t you ?
very much . now hurry up and get changed .
an officer &apos;s gonna be here any minute to remove your monitor .
okay ? oh , my god . oh , wait . wait .
what about carol ? her flight &apos;s gonna be here soon .
text her . have her meet us at the party .
they say freedom comes at a price .
better watch out , charlie .
i think you &apos;re going to be the one footing this bill .
noah shapiro &apos;s trying to steal my book .
so he &apos;s doing you a favor .
now you have nothing to worry about .
it just seems wrong .
there &apos;s nothing more boring than a sense of morality , humphrey .
but since you seem to be so afflicted with it ,
you have two options .
either you go tell simon &amp; schuster and the world
that noah shapiro is a credit @-@ stealing liar ,
or you stay quiet forever and simply let it go .
whatever you decide , do it already .
i might not be able to feel anything ,
but at least i &apos;m not paralyzed .
careful , dan .
he who runs from the fear falls into the pit .
looks like you &apos;re about to take a tumble .
your phone .
and not soon enough .
blair waldorf .
uh , this belongs to one of the models .
check it under the name charlie rho--
excuse me . i &apos;m blair waldorf .
where should i report for hair and makeup ?
oh . i was told you weren &apos;t participating .
mm , now you &apos;re being told differently . keep up .
right this way .
there &apos;s the congressman and his wife .
just remember this is a lifestyle piece ,
so find out what restaurants they &apos;ve been going to lately ,
you know , where they summered , that sort of thing .
oh , and i heard that they just came back from mykonos .
i &apos;d love to hear more about that .
all right , perfect .
jenny packham wanted this to be a
deconstructed fashion show ,
so instead of a runway ,
you &apos;ll be walking through the party with escorts--
either a professional model
or a special guest like yourself .
thank you , joanna .
if you have any eligible rockefellers or whitneys ,
charlie will take one of those .
i myself am fine with a model or a witty gay .
all right . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
what are you even doing here , by the way ?
i &apos;m not so sure myself .
i feel a little like alice in wonderland .
well , manhattan will do that to a girl .
you &apos;ll be happy to know it never wears off .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m leaving right after the fashion show ,
heading back to l.a.
my mom doesn &apos;t want me to live in new york .
it &apos;s not worth fighting her about .
and how old are you again ?
it &apos;s just she has a few things she can hold over my head .
don &apos;t you have a few things you can hold over hers ?
yeah . actually , i do .
i &apos;ll bet . she is a rhodes , isn &apos;t she ?
i &apos;m starting to realize
that mothers have some of the darkest secrets of all .
blair , you &apos;ll be escorted by simon doonan .
why don &apos;t you come with me to meet him ?
and chris benz will be here any minute to escort you .
forget what your mother wants , charlie .
it &apos;s your life .
what do you want ?
ah , restaurants . boulud sud . walter loves brushstroke .
yes , nice .
i never realized you were a journalist , nate .
well , neither did i
until the opportunity presented itself ,
and i went for it .
good for you .
thank you .
so i heard you two just got back from mykonos .
you wanna tell me about that ?
um , you &apos;re mistaken . i had to go to athens
on a congressional trip .
you bastard .
i knew it . were you with her ?
we &apos;re at a party , nola . calm down .
i don &apos;t care where we are .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done .
my lawyer will call you tomorrow ,
and you &apos;d better not put up a fight ,
or i will release those photos to everyone in your district .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to bring up anything personal .
i had no idea what was going on .
and here i thought you were the nice one in your family .
congressman .
rufus and lily humphrey .
no phones ? i like this party already .
come on . let &apos;s take a lap , see who &apos;s here .
what &apos;s lily doing here ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
what happened ? what &apos;s she doing here ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i was so excited to have my freedom back ,
i didn &apos;t think about what it would actually be like when it happened .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
the last time i was at a party like this , i was co @-@ hosting it .
now i &apos;m here as a former convict .
you remember what happened at the pink party .
i mean , i &apos;m sure that the judge was more forgiving
than these people will be .
maybe . lily , you have served your time
with dignity and grace .
you &apos;ve earned the right to move on
to the next chapter of your life .
so if anybody here has a problem with that ,
they don &apos;t get to be a part of the adventure , okay ?
ready ?
lily , so good to see you .
jamie , wow . how are you ?
you look so good .
thanks .
i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
okay .
i &apos;ll catch up with you guys after the show .
see ?
that &apos;s her .
charlie ! what are you doing here ?
please don &apos;t tell my mom that i &apos;m here .
you can tell her yourself .
blair , we need to talk .
do you mind if i take over from here ?
not at all .
well , i mind . humphreys are not escort material .
let &apos;s see if we can change that stereotype .
dorota pieced this together .
apparently , she &apos;s broken quite a few things in your home
you don &apos;t know about .
don &apos;t worry . she swore she didn &apos;t read it .
what are you doing ?
put that away . don &apos;t you have your own life to ruin ?
actually , uh , yeah . yeah , i do ,
but for some reason , i &apos;m here trying to help you .
you can &apos;t hide from this forever .
why not ? apparently , fatherhood holds no appeal for louis ,
and chuck will always be chuck .
if anything , i &apos;m not hiding . i &apos;m facing the truth .
it doesn &apos;t matter what test results say .
i &apos;m in this completely alone .
it doesn &apos;t matter about the implications
for chuck or louis .
don &apos;t you wanna know who the father of your child is ?
the only thing i want is to finish this fashion show
sans outer borough escort .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s your problem , so why don &apos;t you take this ?
this is yours as well .
did you not hear me ? i said i don &apos;t want it .
well , it &apos;s not mine , so take it .
no .
you got it .
oh , b.
your refusal to find out who &apos;s the father
has made you cause one mother of a scene .
you knew if i asked walter wccreedy about mykonos
it would cause a scene , but i just destroyed a marriage .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the truth is , i &apos;m not interested
in interviews with new york &apos;s elite .
i want their secrets and scandals .
oh , aren &apos;t you a little late to that party ?
gossip girl has that covered .
for now .
so you arranged to have everyone &apos;s phones checked
to get at least one story that you didn &apos;t already have ?
it &apos;ll never work . when you try to use what you filmed ,
you &apos;ll be blacklisted .
gossip girl doesn &apos;t create scandal .
she just whispers about what &apos;s already out there .
and i would have told you that if you &apos;d bothered to tell me
what you were doing instead of using me .
i mean , you had everyone &apos;s phones taken .
why didn &apos;t you just , you know , look at some of them ?
nate , that &apos;s brilliant ! and if we act fast ,
we can return them before anyone knows they &apos;re gone !
whoa , no .
this is a one @-@ stop shop of illicit e @-@ mails ,
incriminating photos , and sex .
are you sure you didn &apos;t work for news corp ?
diana , just ...
this is your idea , and it &apos;s a good one .
don &apos;t doubt yourself .
it &apos;s not--i just think that , you know ,
maybe you should dip your toe into illegal activities
before you , you know , just dive right into it .
if you want any real success , nate ,
you need to take a risk once in a while .
you can stay and help me rebuild &quot; the spectator , &quot;
or you can go home and call your mum .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s still a position
in a senator &apos;s office somewhere .
all right , meet me back at the office in 20 minutes ,
not a minute later .
i can &apos;t believe you thought you would get away with this .
you don &apos;t understand .
did you honestly think i wouldn &apos;t come looking for you
when you wrote that check ?
well , get changed . i &apos;m gonna tell lily we &apos;re leaving .
it &apos;s time for you to go back to your real life
like you should have months ago .
actually ...
i think i wanna stay .
it &apos;s not up to you , ivy .
yeah , it kind of is .
it &apos;s not .
what are you gonna do about it ?
call the police ?
i &apos;d be happy to tell &apos; em the whole story
about how you hired a struggling actress
to pretend to be your daughter
so that she could gain access to your real daughter &apos;s trust fund
just so you could take the money for yourself ?
i think the authorities would have a problem with that ,
and your family would , too .
you wouldn &apos;t .
i came from nothing .
everything here sparkles .
and that family that you can &apos;t stand
has been kinder to me than my own family ever was .
i &apos;m not walking away from that .
and if you try to take me down , carol ,
you &apos;re coming with me .
blair , i &apos;m sorry .
i was totally out of line .
truth is i think i &apos;ve been using you to avoid
facing some problems of my own .
i promised to hold your hand , but maybe i &apos;ve been forcing it .
no . i turned to you , dan ,
because i knew you were the only one
who &apos;d protect me from my own worst instincts .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
when georgina showed up on my doorstep
and told me she was pregnant , i mean , the last thing
i wanted to be was a father , but then milo was born ,
and i fell in love with him .
chuck or louis--it &apos;ll be the same for either of them .
and if i open that envelope ...
will you be able to hide from your problems then ?
i think if you have the courage to face your future ,
then i should have the courage to face mine .
there once was a princess b. ,
undone by the question &quot; who &apos;s the daddy ? &quot;
but it &apos;s time to find out--
will it be chuck ,
or will it be louis ?
i need to talk to you .
i thought we said everything we needed to say
last time we saw each other .
chuck ...
is this another misguided attempt by dan
to get me to feel something ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
it &apos;s louis &apos; .
i ...
i didn &apos;t want you to find out from someone else
and wonder if the baby was yours .
that &apos;s very considerate .
yes , well ...
if i know anything about chuck bass ,
it &apos;s that fatherhood isn &apos;t part of the lifestyle .
you must have been very relieved
when you realized you weren &apos;t carrying my offspring .
that certainly would have derailed your fairy tale .
this fairy tale is ... complicated .
blair , meet my dog , monkey .
but ... i saw &quot; gossip girl . &quot; i thought you got rid of him .
i just sent him to get fixed .
i thought it was the responsible thing to do .
i should go .
yes .
louis is waiting for me .
of course .
there is a part of me that really wanted it to be yours .
it &apos;s impossible , you know . he &apos;s got to say to himself ,
&quot; i &apos;m a writer ! i &apos;m a writer ! &quot;
he can hook up with a rookie . all those people
were just drinking themselves into the grave , you know ?
noah .
hey , uh , i need to talk to you .
everyone , this is dan humphrey .
he was my inspiration
for the character of dylan hunter .
isn &apos;t that right , daniel ?
no .
you didn &apos;t write this book . i did .
bravo !
he did it !
i told you i &apos;d get him to step forward .
i &apos;m sorry . did you-- did you do this on purpose ?
destiny is a scary thing to face .
we all need a little push .
you deserve to see what comes of it yourself ,
and you will . this is elise and mark from s &amp; s.
this is jonathan karp , your editor .
you already know alessandra . sit . join us .
we &apos;ve got a lot to talk about .
to my beautiful wife , her freedom ,
and the end of the ankle bracelet .
oh , and to the return of my alaia dresses .
how about we toast to second chances ,
for lily and me ?
and , mom , thank you for understanding
that this is where i &apos;m meant to be .
cheers .
cheers .
you know , charlie , serena &apos;s room is empty ,
and you are welcome to stay here .
we &apos;d love to have you .
no , no , no . that-- that would be an imposition .
no , really . eric has only been gone a few days ,
and rufus and i are already
going through empty nest syndrome .
yeah , making breakfast for two feels so wrong .
i would love to .
being around family would mean a lot to me .
great .
okay , well , um ...
i &apos;m gonna go crash in the guest room .
i have an early flight .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;s only 9 : 00 .
you should go out .
we could all go out .
maybe--maybe another time .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be back again soon anyway .
i &apos;m gonna make sure that cece
reinstates your access to my trust .
you are on your own now . good luck .

the true author of a tell @-@ all tome has been revealed ,
and the author &apos;s name is one everyone will recognize ,
亚历山德拉
but the question is ,
will anyone want to say it again
once the book is out ?
you &apos;re pregnant .
you &apos;re pregnant .
oh , you &apos;re happy .
but ... your &quot; hello ! &quot; magazine interview--
i heard your answers .
i @-@ i just said those things to protect you .
i knew if i even hinted at wanting children ,
you would be under constant baby watch .
the press would never leave you alone .
you did that for me ?
you really are a prince .
a very happy prince .
the truth is , i can &apos;t wait to be a father .
and now i &apos;m going to be one .
let &apos;s go celebrate . where would you like to go ?
oh , someplace with souffles .
my morning sickness is gone .
i know a place .
they closed an hour ago , but they &apos;ll reopen for us .
ready .
face your fears , and the rewards can be profound .
you could discover the true depth of a relationship .
or what you &apos;re capable of withstanding .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
you know , i don &apos;t think i realized
until i saw you in l.a. how much i needed family around
or how much you needed me to help you shop .
what are you looking for over there ?
my phone .
i think i left it at the fashion show
when the assistant checked it in .
i totally forgot .
well , i &apos;m sure they still have it .
we &apos;ll call in the morning and find out .
the problem is , the more you gain ...
people trust their phones way too much .
the more you stand to lose .
there &apos;s just this , uh , one phone that didn &apos;t have a tag on it ,
so i didn &apos;t put it back .
you know whose it is ? maybe someone at coat check ?
do you know someone called ivy ?
get ready to find out what you &apos;re made of ,
打给我 --马克斯
because to survive on the upper east side ,
you better be fearless .
