it &apos;s alive !
it &apos;s alive !
friend ?
bart , you want to see something cool ?
oh , did you pick that big scab off your knee ?
no .
don &apos;t touch the scab !
my science fair project proves
that an asteroid will strike the earth on july 15 , 9789 .
who cares ?
i &apos;ll be president of hell by then .
fine . good luck with your project ,
which i &apos;m sure you haven &apos;t started yet .
i &apos;ll tell you my project .
a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd !
that &apos;s pathetic .
aw , geez , i put a lot of time in this .
back to the drawing board .
hey , bart !
is your cootie shot ready ?
no . the science fair &apos;s not till next week .
i really need that shot .
my dog and i accidentally touched tongues .
how is it &quot; accidentally &quot; when this is the fifth time ?
bart , isn &apos;t that awfully similar
to the cootie patch you did last year ?
that was preventative .
this is morning @-@ after .
oh , you &apos;re right .
oh , what am i going to do ?
good ideas don &apos;t grow on trees .
or do they ?
good shot !
not really . i was trying to bounce it off your left testie .
&quot; testis , &quot; my friend .
look , i need help with my science fair project .
to sweeten the deal ,
i &apos;ll pick you first for basketball .
ah ! to be a mathlete !
without the &quot; m. &quot;
fly , orb , and find thy hoop !
i &apos;m in !
in the event of a primary core breach ,
you have 15 seconds to avoid a complete ...
howdy !
a woman of stature !
roz davis , your new assistant .
assistant ?
well , i have been pretty overworked lately .
but i guess i should find out a little bit about you .
i &apos;m just a gal from ohio who never wants to
call her daddy again and say , &quot; i need to borrow money . &quot;
so your dad has money to lend ?
this is where we get our coffee .
just leave a little at the bottom ,
so someone else has to make the next pot .
the burning smell will let them know .
genius .
uh @-@ oh . it &apos;s old man burns .
hello , young man burns !
oh , simpson , you do know how to whip my buggy .
that sucker soaks up flattery
like a twinkie soaks up gravy .
well , when it &apos;s a handsome guy like you talking ...
well ...
your giggle &apos;s like strawberry wine .
and your snort &apos;s like a summer breeze .
that &apos;s not very attractive , though .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
bart , i fail to see the scientific function
of this &quot; homer humiliator &quot; you &apos;ve devised .
well , we gotta come up with something .
hey , what if we make some kind of robopet ?
what made you think of that ?
thy will be done , lord vader .
绝地武士的灾难 原力黑暗面的大师 更是皇帝最信任的臣仆之一
just don &apos;t hurt me . oh , please !
a robopet !
not a bad idea .
bully , bart ! bully !
where ? is it nelson ?
no , bart , it &apos;s just an expression .
who hath summoned me ?
baby seal , huh ?
research shows
it &apos;s impossible to gaze at a baby seal
and say anything but ...
precisely .
and at science fairs , the &quot; aw &quot; s get the &quot; a &quot; s.
ah ! heavens to asimov !
must make sure these wires aren &apos;t crossed .
marge !
get my seal club ! the big one !
they &apos;re all pretty big .

i &apos;m an experiment .
fine .
check it out !
so the soft fur , big eyes , and gentle motion
are designed to make it one hell of a pet ,
with none of the poop .
this is the most adorable thing i &apos;ve ever seen
in my entire life .
what a wonderful science fair .
unfortunately , due to budget cuts ,
we could not afford our third place ribbon .
now in second place , lisa simpson &apos;s grim description
of our short @-@ sighted dependence on fossil fuels .
it &apos;s about an asteroid .
they &apos;re all the same , gloomhilda .
first place goes to bart simpson and martin prince ...
... for creating a furry robotic friend
who provides comfort when humans fail to .
which they will , trust me .
i carried you in my belly for four and a half months .
when you fell out on the bus ,
that &apos;s when my job ended .
congratulations on getting a ribbon , lisa !
you must &apos;ve baked a mighty fine pie .
it wasn &apos;t a pie .
it was science !
and it &apos;s not fair .
my project was way better than bart &apos;s ,
and i didn &apos;t have help from a nerd !
i &apos;m my own nerd !
oh , sweetie .
being second ain &apos;t the worst thing that can happen .
look at poor old jasper over there .
he lost his wife , his kids don &apos;t call .
soon he &apos;ll just be bones and beard .
while i was sitting here feeling sorry for myself ,
bart &apos;s invention actually changed someone &apos;s life .
and best of all , i got funding for my homer humiliator .
why would a homer humiliator do this to me ?
yello .
hey , barney .
a free movie screening ?
of course i can go !
i just need somebody to hold down the fort .
hm ! oh , uh , roz ?
i have to step out for one hour and 43 minutes .
could you cover for me ?
go ahead .
oh , uh ... if an emergency alarm goes off ,
there &apos;s earplugs in the top drawer .
life imitates flart .
it says that on the poster .
i thought of it first .
marge , i just saw the greatest movie !
guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus .
i &apos;ll give you a clue .
it &apos;s funny !
take off the 3 @-@ d glasses .
simpson-- a gangly little bird told me
you &apos;ve been lollygagging at the biograph .
someone snitched ?
w @-@ w @-@ what are you going to do to me ?
you &apos;re demoted .
up , or down ?
down !
don &apos;t tell my wife .
so , partner , what &apos;s next on the agenda ?
back off , man !
can &apos;t you see you &apos;re embarrassing bart ?
when did you take that picture ?
last time you slept over at my house .
i love when you &apos;re sleeping and at peace .
hey , skippy , we need some more of them loveable critters
for our friends at the home .
unless you got any heroin .
you got any heroin ?
well , then , critters it is .
i &apos;m telling you guys , roz told oldan burns
i ditched work early , and now i &apos;m her assistant .
i don &apos;t know , homer .
you &apos;re saying she &apos;s nice on the outside , but mean on the inside ?
no one could pull that off .
enjoy .
and as for you , homer , don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;re at moe &apos;s tavern-- lady @-@ free since &apos; 83 .
what the ... ? this is a gentleman &apos;s club !
yeah !
so , what you boys drinkin &apos; ?
i &apos;m buyin &apos; .
can we just have the cash value of the drink ?
be my guest .
i &apos;d rather use my money
to buy a moe souvenir t @-@ shirt .
that comes in kid sizes , too .
oh , no , this is terrible .
what am i gonna do ? oh ...
aren &apos;t you gonna come to bed , homie ?
can &apos;t , marge .
i &apos;m fighting for my professional life here .
do you know what i just learned ?
my job is the reason i get the checks every week .
and now that i &apos;m demoted , the checks have gotten smaller .
not in physical size , but ...
i know . i know .
i represent the eternal valley funeral home ,
and i &apos;m here to talk about an extremely unpleasant subject :
people continuing to live .
if we don &apos;t have a frickin &apos; funeral soon , people ,
you can say good @-@ bye to howard &apos;s flowers !
calm down , howard jr .
now , here is the zip , the zap and the zing .
we &apos;re gonna rewire charlie loveable here
into the greatest threat to seniors &apos; lives
since nursing homes themselves .
switcheroo .
impressive .
hard to believe two ten @-@ year @-@ old kids built this .
and i heard one of them did all the work .
wow . it &apos;s true .
am i early
you &apos;re late .
since i got demoted , i have to show my i.d. ,
but the picture was taken so long ago ,
i put on a lot of weight ,
so i have to stretch out my face and say ,
&quot; i used to look like this . &quot;
late .
you &apos;re mean .
now , i want a list of a hundred ways
to make your job worse by close of business today .
can one of the hundred be making the list ?
no .
can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones ?
also , no .
we &apos;re live at the springfield retirement castle ,
where long @-@ time resident , alice glick , died last night ,
at the paws of this cuddly little killer .
our channel six substitute medical expert
dr. nick riviera had this to say .
the champion was cleared to fight .
ahem , doctor , this press conference
is about a nursing home death .
the springfield police are in the process
of taking all the robots
into custody , safely returning the seniors
to their hopeless , dismal lives .
shut that thing off .
i meant the tv !
sorry .
hi . we need someone
to reprogram our robots to break out of jail .
a chance to reprogram robots ?
well , i had a date with a beauty queen tonight ,
but forget it .
uh , hello , yes , hello , miss wyoming ?
i @-@ i &apos;ll have to climb your grand tetons another night .
the breast joke !
i @-@ i served it up .
why won &apos;t he love me ? !
&quot; do this , do that . &quot; lousy roz thinks she &apos;s so big .
well , looks like it &apos;s time for another
&quot; end of the walk talk with homer and ned . &quot;
tonight &apos;s topic : the niceness of the evening .
homer , all nonsense aside ,
are you okalidokalaroony ?
i &apos;m having problems with my new boss roz .
she &apos;s the most evil person to come out of ohio since lebron .
but at least he thought long and hard
before screwing everybody over , in public , for no reason .
you know , i knew a backstabbing buckeye
named roz at bible camp .
twice as tall as she should &apos;ve been .
is this her ?
come on !
the apple must be wreaking havoc with the twinkie !
it is .
but if you &apos;ve got the stones ,
i can tell you how to slay that &quot; gal @-@ ioth . &quot;
are you aware that &quot; stones &quot; means man junk ?
what the-- i &apos;ve been using that around the boys .
whew ! thank you .
now , it was one of our biggest celebrations ,
the 19th sunday after easter .
we &apos;d just had a rousing no @-@ fun run ,
and in the heat of the moment , i wanted to offer
my respectful best wishes .
peace be with you .
well , sir , she went crazy .
crazier than sleeping in on a sunday .
i can &apos;t stand to be touched !
never tell anyone !
and i haven &apos;t .
not until now .
that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s it !
my nightmare is over !
oh , flanders , you are my personal savior .
oh , that &apos;s nice , but i don &apos;t approve of ...
hail flanders !
mightier than jesus !
yes , i , uh , i hereby call to order this meeting
of the north american man @-@ bot love association .
i &apos;ll say this one more time :
we really should change that name .
yes , all right , i &apos;ll change it to whatever you like ,
as long as &quot; man @-@ bot love &quot; is in there somewhere .
now , let &apos;s look at these blueprints , shall we ?
wish i &apos;d thought of that .
uh , first , we remotely adjust them
so they will never be malicious again .
there , there and there .
now , arise , little ones !
hey @-@ hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
i better call 911 .
oh , it &apos;s always busy when i call .
what a bunch of idiots .
hey-- aw , i can &apos;t stay mad at you .
go on , get out of here .
oh , oh , chief ?
yeah ?
yeah , you , too .
although this millennium is still young ,
i feel it is time to award
this giant trophy , paid for with your health care cuts ...
... to our beloved roz .
what the deuce ?
sarcastic clapping ?
congratulations , roz .
what are you doing here , simpson ?
if there isn &apos;t dry cleaning in the back of my car ,
there &apos;s gonna be blood on my knuckles .
uh , i just came to say that you &apos;re perfect .
so perfect , i think mr. burns should give you a hug .
who told you ?
i won &apos;t say , but his initials are s.f.
stupid flanders !
hug , hug , hug !
hug , hug , hug ,
hug , hug , hug , hug ... !
you &apos;re fired .
i underestimated you .
i don &apos;t know what that middle word means .
well , it means my perception of you is that you were
kind of a goof , but now i see you &apos;re rather clever .
what is perception ?
it &apos;s how i view you .
you understand that ?
no .
i used to think you were an idiot .
now it turns out , you &apos;re not such an idiot ,
in fact , you might even be smart .
little help ?
rub the butter around you .
need more butter !
and not the unsalted .
do you want to get out of there or not ?
mr. j. , if i don &apos;t get my green card ,
they &apos;re gonna turn me back into a washing machine .
no dawdling . just move it along .
my mechanical mensch !
how i missed you .
bless you , boys .
now that we got &apos; em back , we &apos;ll never let &apos; em go again .
&apos;cause there &apos;s no stronger force
than a senior citizen holding onto a freebie .
