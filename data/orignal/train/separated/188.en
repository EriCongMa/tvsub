It was so much easier
When it was just about where we sat on the met steps.
It's time for a new challenge,
for both of us.
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.
And how can you be so sure?
Because you believe in me.
You were the one that needed to kiss her again
to realize for yourself that your feelings for her are real.
Vanessa, I love you.
Oh that's not really the reaction I was hoping for.
It's not easy being queen.
Sounds like kind of a yawn.
Yes compared to being an international drug dealer.
A little bit of danger is what makes life worth living.
Two years ago at the masquerade ball
I tried to tell you I loved you.
You loved me?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Tripp is divorcing maureen.
We're going away together.
It is a huge mistake.
I love tripp and I'd do anything to make him happy.
Where'd you get that?
The more relevant question is what your stepfather will say
When he finds out that your mother is a cheating whore.
You left her alone in a wrecked car?!
You stay the hell away from her.
You're becoming a man in a way that your father never was.
Lily?
Charles.
His beloved wife died giving birth to me.
"It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times."
Seems Dickens knew something about life on the upper east side
Where the only thing you can count on
is that time changes everything.
Word has it. S Gave up politics
to focus on issues closer to her heart.
I can't believe Nate's finally coming home tomorrow.
I feel the same way about Dorota's return.
I never should have agreed
to let her spend the holidays with Vanya.
Did I tell you that he texts me
Every night before he goes to sleep?
It's so sweet.
Sexting is not sweet.
It's off-limits until you're in a relationship.
You haven't even been on a date.
Well you'll be happy to know he asked me to go to a dinner
for the french ambassador tomorrow night.
Oh well chastity belts go very well with formal wear.
I'm serious S. I'm all for you trying this thing with Nate
But if you want it to become real
Then you're going to have to take it slow.
Okay I-I promise I will. I have to go.
Damien Dalgaard!
Oh my gosh!
How are ya?
Good. I thought you were gonna become a Belgian prince
or something after boarding school.
My father took the ambassador post.
You look even more fantastic than you did in school.
Oh that was not a very good time for me.
That's not true.
I seem to remember some fun spanish classes.
Really? More like me crying over conjugations
While you got straight A's and won all the athletic awards.
You had the Mr. Perfect thing down.
Well I'm late to meet a friend.
So uh I'd love to catch up some more.
Yeah great. Text me your number.
Okay.
Good to see you.
Yeah you too.
Hey are you going to the french ambassador dinner tomorrow night?
I am.
Then I'll see you there.
See you there.
You know how torturous it is
For me to find shiny things that aren't intended for me.
It's just a worthless trinket
Some woman left by my father's grave.
And you aren't even the least bit curious
About someone who wears your father around her neck?
One of his concubines had his name tattooed on her ass.
I have more important things to do than search
for another member of the female Bart Bass fan club.
Like helping me achieve
the college experience I so greatly deserve?
I assume you're referring to my lunch
to discuss Parisian hotel possibilities
with Henri Duris.
Who my research also tells me is
the rumored president of table elitaire.
Just imagining my life as a member
of the most exclusive secret society makes me tingle.
Well while I find that incredibly arousing
You know I can't promise anything but an introduction.
All I need to know is
that the most persuasive and powerful man I've ever met
is on my side.
So how was your mom's?
I'm sure your dad called every day.
Well he v-chatted for present opening.
You didn't want to go to telluride with him huh?
I can't say I blame you.
Those Lincoln Hawk guys can be kind of annoying.
Well he was so excited when it came up.
I couldn't stand for him to miss out.
Hi.
Welcome home.
Damien hi.
Hey.
Lily you remember Damien right?
Oh yes. Yes. Hello.
Mrs. Humphrey how are you?
And uh this is for you.
Thank you. Mm.
Um thank you Lily for helping me unpack
But I think I'm good now.
Um Jenny?
Um a word please?
So your father and I haven't really discussed
You having boys alone in your room.
Maybe just keep the door open?
Lily if we wanted to have sex we'd just go to a hotel.
And seriously it's not like that with us.
Oh then what is it like?
I mean he seems happy to see you.
Um I'll open the door if anything changes.
Oh and you wouldn't happen to know
when your father was coming back。
Larissa accidentally lost the itinerary.
I think he said today
But just call him and ask.
So cookies. Let me guess.
I have a puzzle that needs solving.
I know how much you Humphreys like games.
It's my work all right.
Do you remember who you sold this one to?
The picture's right there-- Bart Bass.
Do you know who he bought it for?
Mr. Bass kept the recipients of his purchases private.
But a woman did bring this one
To repair the hinge about a month ago.
The woman--
Early 40s,brown hair,brown eyes?
Look I would be very grateful
If you could share any other information you may have.
I'm sorry. Client confidentiality.
My father was the original client.
Please this is all I have left of him.
Elizabeth Fisher.
She paid in cash.
But she had it delivered.
Thank you.
With enough time
we all find what we're looking for...
Even if it was there all along.
Nate!
What are you doing here?
Hey. Oh my gosh.
You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow.
I know. My grandfather got sick of watching me text you
So he had the plane bring me home early.
Well remind me to send him a gift.
Well I should go.
I left the driver downstairs waiting with the bags
So I could surprise you
But tomorrow though right?
Yes our first official date.
I've been thinking a-and I really think
That we should try to take this slow.
Yeah. Yeah I was thinking the same thing.
Okay.
And when time slows
And suddenly every moment counts
All you want is for this time to last forever.
Hey.
What? I'm not that late.
Oh no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry man.
I was just hoping you were Vanessa.
Oh you invited Vanessa here too?
No not exactly. But she does spend a lot of time here.
I take it that means you still haven't talked to her.
Or gotten a text or seen her.
It's my fault. I moved too fast you know?
I read like, five self-help blogs
About how to turn friends into lovers.
Yes they use that word. I was a little down at my mom's place.
Well hey man I'm sorry.
You know they say that you should take things more slowly
With a friend than you do with someone you just met.
I'll--I'll send you the link. You might want to read it
Before you start this thing with Serena.
Hey.
Oh.
Looks like my advice went the way of the clog.
What are you talking about?
The clog?
An ugly wooden shoe
that tried to make a statement then disappeared--
Just like your resolve to take things slow with Nate.
I'm just gonna go with it. You know whatever happens happens.
All right, we all knowing Serena what'll probably happen is
she'll get swept up in the romance of things
And she's not gonna want to talk about any of that stuff ever.
Really.
Nah look it's cool.
I've known Serena since I was a little kid.
And we've already... you know years ago.
I know. Trust me.
Now that I'm with chuck I can see that Nate and I
Were only perfect on paper. But...
You and Nate can finally be more than just an affair to remember.
Which is why we didn't want to wait for it to start.
And why you don't want to scare him off.
Listen the point is I've dated serena for over a year.
And if you want to be able to make things work
You're gonna have to be able to come up for air
which is really not her favorite thing to do.
You are the one thing Nate has always wanted
And could never have. It's like a diet.
After years of starvation
You can't just let him gorge on sundaes.
He'll panic and decide he hates ice cream.
Except I'm not ice cream
And Nate and I don't need to play games.
Everyone needs to play games.
Look you've already failed to come out of the gate
with any restraint or control. Now all you can do is
introduce some competition make him work for it.
Blair that's the worst advice I've ever heard.
Mm-hmm. Just wait till he starts passing on dessert.
So the Ambassador's daughter's gonna be at this dinner?
Yeah but her father's got her under 24-hour surveillance
Which means her guards will be on her at all times.
Well I can meet her in the ladies' room.
I bet they don't follow her in there.
Or we could switch handbags.
You--you need to understand. This is a state dinner.
Which means there's security everywhere.
All bags will be searched.
The problem is not getting the package to Violette
It's getting the package in in the first place.
I could wear it.
I can make this. Only in mine the paillettes won't be empty.
You put the pills...
In the jacket?
Yeah I wear it to the dinner
Check it and then Violette and I switch coat check tags.
I take her coat...
And she'll leave with yours.
It's not bad.
Not bad?
Come on. It's brilliant!
Lily?
Oh hello daniel.
Hey. What--what you doing in Brooklyn?
Um I was hoping your father would be here.
He was supposed to be back this morning.
I can't imagine he'd come here before going to see you.
Well I just figured
Since he hadn't seen you over the holidays...
You know how sentimental he is.
Yeah. Dad?
Well you know what?
Maybe he decided to stay and ski another day.
Uh yeah I don't--I don't think that's what happened.
Well I should go. If you see him
Tell him I stopped by.
Okay.
Vronsky where are you?
Anna Karenina texted you an hour ago.
She wants to celebrate.
Look I'm sorry but Anna will have to wait.
I'm about to walk into a meeting.
With monsieur Duris?
Are you bringing him here to surprise me?
As it turns out I wasn't able to attend the lunch.
Are you in the hospital?
Since I know that you're alive
There could be no other possible reason
You would sacrifice my entire future.
Look I'll get you your introduction okay?
Monsieur Duris will be attending
the dinner for the French ambassador tomorrow night.
Oh thank god
You practically gave me a heart attack.
Why didn't you mention this earlier?
I just assumed you'd rather not cross paths with Carla Bruni.
Well in times of crisis,
sacrifices must be made.
Why did you miss lunch?
I'm trying to meet someone whose schedule is
Even more unpredictable than mine.
I'll see you tonight.
I've been waiting here for four hours.
Has Elizabeth Fisher still not returned?
She did return Mr. Bass.
Then why did she not get my message
that I was waiting for her in the bar?
She did.
She checked out of the hotel immediately afterwards.
Whoa! Hey Blair.
It's Anna Karenina. You never read it. Don't worry about it.
I never do.
Come on boy.
Rufus.
What are you doing standing out here?
Making a decision.
How are you doing? Did you end up going away?
I just got back this morning.
And are you back for good?
That's what I'm deciding.
I came over to talk to Lily
but now I'm not sure.
I want to give her a chance to explain.
But still there's a part of me that doesn't want to know.
Cup of coffee?
It's freezing out here.
Coffee actually sounds really good.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey. I was just about to call you.
Well now you don't have to.
Or we don't have to talk at all.
Look I um
I was just thinking that maybe it might make sense
if I go to that dinner tomorrow night alone.
I don't understand. Did I do something wrong?
No. No not at all. I just...
You know we said we didn't want to rush into things.
Yeah, but that was before we saw each other.
I know. I know.
But I'm just trying to stick to the plan here.
Okay so the plan went from having sex
on Eleanor Waldorf's floor to not seeing each other?
Just because we lost track for a minute there
doesn't mean we should just forget about it.
I mean we already saw each other today.
We can wait a couple more days right?
You're right Nate.
Uh the last thing I would want to do is rush into something.
No. Serena, come on.
Hello?
Hey Damien.
Serena.
Don't tell me you need help with your Spanish homework.
No, French this time.
Please tell me you don't have a date to the ambassador's dinner.
Are you asking me if I want to go with you?
Of course I do.
Great. I'm staying at the Waldorfs'
So I'll text you the address. I'll see you tomorrow.
Heure hora laat--
No matter what language you say it in
Looks like S. just started the clock on a ticking time bomb.
I thought you'd be at school by now.
I thought you lived in the upper east side with your wife.
Dan.
Lily came by yesterday looking for you.
Uh what's--what's going on?
Lily and I had a fight. It's complicated.
Israeli-Palestinian complicated by the looks of it.
Is this--is this why you shipped Jenny and me
off to mom's for christmas?
This was your mother's year.
And it wasn't one of those "Parent trap" Situations
that you and Jenny could swoop in on.
Lily and I need time to figure this out.
And um and you're doing that
by not telling her where you are?
It's not the best strategy
but until I actually talk to her
at least I can hold out hope that I'm wrong about what happened.
So you're not talking to her
because you don't want to hear what you think she might tell you?
You know I'm not willing to explain myself, Dan.
All right.
Fine. Fine. You can make your own damn waffles.
Come on Dan.
Listen you're--you're the one who's always saying
to be honest and talk about things
So I really hope you're not gonna let your marriage die
because you're scared to take your own advice.
All the girls are gonna want to wear pharmaceuticals.
It's perfect.
I'm impressed.
Thanks. I'm really excited about tonight.
Yeah. Yeah.
Me too.
Unfortunately we're gonna have to do our little dinner some other time.
What? I... thought we were doing this together.
It's my plan.
Yeah.
I know. And--and I thank you.
It's just that uh anyone can check the jacket.
I'm going with someone else--
Serena actually.
We're old friends from boarding school.
Serena's with Nate now.
I don't know about that.
She's the one who called and asked me so...
Well you know she's changed since boarding school
And uh there's--there's no way she's gonna go to a state dinner
wearing a jacket filled with pills.
I probably won't tell her about that then.
Well then maybe I will.
See if you were to do that
then I would have to tell her
how you know obviously.
So...
Anyway
Don't worry. You'll still get your cut.
伊丽莎白·菲舍刚刚入住阿尔贡金旅馆
What's going on?
Why aren't you dressed?
Look blair I'm sorry.
But I won't be able to join you for Daer ce soir.
Abandoning me in a fur hat is one thing
But you can't do this. You already missed the lunch.
You know my dreams are dead
without a proper introduction to Monsieur Duris.
Look I left word with his people
that you'd be there okay?
I'm sure you'll find a way to make an impression.
This is about her, isn't it?
The floozy from your father's grave
You said you had no interest in finding.
It appears I may have spoken too quickly in that regard.
First you lie to me about looking for her,
and now you're going to sacrifice
my la table elitaire
to go and look for some random woman
You obviously read the file,
so you know she's not random.
She knew my mother's favorite flowers,
She had a picture of my father in her jewelry
and she knew me.
And clearly has no interest in being found by you.
You've been looking for weeks, and nothing.
One dinner with me won't make a difference.
I know you may find this hard to comprehend,
but some things are more important
than your social-climbing agenda.
His name's damien.
Oh, hey, Jenny.
He's the son of the belgian ambassador,
and I'm pretty sure they hooked up at boarding school.
I'm guessing serena didn't tell you
She was coming with him, huh? No. No, she didn't.
Why are you here?
I figured you've come to my rescue enough times.
Let me help you for once.
Hi. May I take your coat?
You came with him? You came with her?
I think you're at the wrong place. Prom is down the street.
Oh, that's fine.
I'll just let you get back to your euro-fawning.
Jenny, um...
What are you doing here? Just finishing what I started.
Serena, I love your jacket. It's so beautiful.
Yeah, actually, let me help you with that.
No, it's okay. I'm gonna keep it on.
It's so pretty, and it was a gift from you.
So sweet of you. Come on.
So much for diplomacy.
Let the international games begin.
Mesdames et messieurs,
L'ambassadeur de france et sa fille violette.
Serena. And... not nate.
Hi. I'm blair.
Damien. A pleasure.
Um, the, uh, French ambassador's daughter's
an old friend of mine. I'm gonna let you guys... mm.
Excuse me.
I see you took my advice.
It's good to keep Nate on his toes.
And nice choice of competition.
Thank you.
Your idea's completely juvenile, but it seems to be working.
I'm jenny. Nice to meet you. Thank you so much.
I still can't believe he came with Jenny, though.
If I know Jenny, she came with him.
But trust me. This is exactly what you wanted.
Games will be played, sexual innuendo ensues.
And in the end, nate will be right where you wanted him.
My problems are not nearly so easily resolved.
Even monsieur Duris' entourage
is perfection in bone structure and styling.
While without a formal introduction,
I have no choice but to stalk him.
Blair, you know you don't need chuck.
Anyone who meets you can see you're an elitist snob
who's perfect to run a secret society.
Bonne chance.
Ah! Merci.
On a un petit soucis, mais je t'assure
J'appellerai le flic
pour cette garce qui le porte.
Uh, hi. I'm Jenny.
French people really are rude.
She's usually a much happier customer.
Yeah. Looks like the plan's off the rails thanks to Serena, huh?
From what I recall from boarding school,
it wasn't terribly difficult to get Serena out of her clothes.
That jacket is not leaving this party
on Serena van der Woodsen.
Serena, I don't know why you're here with that guy.
I mean, if you're trying to make me jealous,
There's no reason to. I want to be here with you. I invited you.
But then you uninvited me.
But you're right. Taking it slow was the right decision.
Hi. Damien.
Nate archibald.
Serena, let me introduce you to some people.
Thanks for keeping my date company.
So what's the deal with Nate,
The guy who seemed like he wanted to cut my head off?
Is he an ex-boyfriend or something?
Oh, possibly a new one. Honestly, that's the reason
I asked you to bring me here tonight. I'm sorry.
No, don't be. The old make-him-jealous-
By-bringing-the-titled-european ploy.
Yep.
Well, I'm flattered you thought I was worthy of the task.
Well, thank you for understanding.
If you really want to make him jealous, though,
I suggest we commit fully, you know?
Let me take off this jacket.
No, Damien. I'm sorry. I-I can't do this.
This was a huge mistake already. I...
No, no, no. We can make it better.
No strings attached.
Damien, I-I don't like you like that.
I mean it.
Hey.
Are you serious? What happened to the serena that I wanted
Throughout boarding school?
I've changed, and it's a good thing.
Serena.
I'm sorry. That--that wasn't...
Monsieur Duris?
C'est vous n'est-ce pas?
I'm sorry. Have we been introduced?
I'm blair waldorf. Perhaps you've heard of me?
I submitted a charter application for N.Y.U.
Can you just hold on one minute?
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Chuck.
There you are.
I knew you'd see the error of your ways.
Monsieur Duris just stepped out for his cigarette break,
Which gives us two and a half minutes, maybe four,
If it's a gauloise.
I came to apologize.
Ugh. What happened?
Don't tell me that awful whore did something terrible to you.
I think that whore may be my mother.
There you are.
Serena's about to leave. You need to stop her.
You know what, Jenny? This just isn't fun for me anymore.
I should have never listened to Dan.
Okay, I don't know what Dan said,
But why would you take romantic advice
From a guy who has a cabbage patch doll?
I don't know. All you need to know is I blew my chance.
The masquerade ball was two years ago.
Don't let Serena get away again.
You know your mother died during childbirth.
What if she didn't?
What if it was just another of my father's many lies?
Look,
It makes sense that when you finally let your father go,
Your mother would reappear.
She's not a ghost, Blair.
Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds?
It's why I couldn't tell you or anyone.
I'm aware that one of Bart's old girlfriends
May have known my name,
And maybe even look like old pictures of my mother.
But my father only had one of these made with an "E" On it.
This woman had it.
Whoever she is,
It just seems like...
She'll make losing your mom hurt all over again.
Do you really think
Anything could be more painful
Than killing my own mother
And having my father hate me for it my whole life?
If there is any chance
This isn't what happened, I have to know.
I don't want to keep you
From your business with monsieur Duris.
I just had to let you know.
Nothing...
Is more important than being with you for this.
Sometimes despite the risk,
The only thing to do is seize the moment...
Or whatever else you can grab.
I really always hope that Blair is wrong about these things,
But if the only reason you want to be with me is
Because I'm with someone else, then you can forget it.
No, I want to be here with you.
I just got scared that if we moved too fast
Things weren't gonna work out,and
I really don't want that to happen.
Okay, because I've waited...
I've waited a really long time for this.
Me, too.
You've applied the pressure?
We need to talk.
Rufus, finally.
I-I-I must have called you a hundred times.
I told you I'd call you back when I was ready.
Well, I guess I just didn't expect it to take quite so long.
Well, I guess you should have thought about that before you...
spent the night in a hotel room with your ex-husband.
Well, I'm here now.
So why don't you tell me exactly what happened?
Lil, I'm not interested in any more lies.
We should probably go.
Mnh-mnh. Let's finish what we started.
Not having any fun?
No. No, but you go ahead and have yours.
Please... gloat.
You've earned it.
Well, you're always telling me that this is a business
and not my social life,
But yet you're the one who screwed up a major deal
because you wanted to fulfill
a high school dream of a night with Serena Van der Woodsen.
Irony duly noted.
Maybe next time you won't be so quick to dismiss me.
I don't know if there will be a next time.
Word of this botched job will get around to my other clients.
And I owe Violette more money
than I could possibly steal back from my father,
So I think it's time for me to head back to the continent.
Hey, Damien.
What is that jacket doing on the floor?
It belongs to the amBassador's daughter.
She'll be furious.
Hang it up and make absolutely sure
that Violette gets it when she leaves.
Looks like you can cancel that transatlantic ticket.
I guess so.
Elizabeth?
I'm sorry. Have we met?
You ran away from me at my father's grave.
I'm Charles Bass.
Oh, of course.
I apologize for my sudden departure.
It was a very emotional day for me.
You must have known my father very well.
I'm not sure what gives you that impression.
Your father and I simply shared
a few memorable months many years ago.
I was actually visiting my mother's grave,
and I just stopped to pay my respects.
At that time of the night?
On the anniversary of my father's death?
I saw you had his favorite flowers.
And you knew who I was.
I'm sorry. I... I read that Bart Had A Son,
And you look just like your father.
Most people say I more closely resemble my mother.
I wouldn't know.
I never had the pleasure of meeting her.
Well, maybe...
You can tell me why
you had her locket.
Your father gave it to me.
The "E" Is for "Elizabeth."
I loved to believe it was a special gift.
I'm fairly certain he gave it
to all his girlfriends at the time.
You're welcome to keep it, if you'd like.
I'm sure it means a great deal more to you than it does to me.
I'm sorry I can't help you find
whatever it is you're looking for.
Blair, I'm sorry to waste your time.
You should have stayed with Monsieur Duris.
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
I'm just going to visit the ladies' room.
Then we'll leave.
I'll bring the car around.
Elizabeth.
I already told your friend everything I know.
And he may have bought it.
But I originated that innocent, doe-eyed stare.
I usually employ it when I know more than I'm willing to let on.
Chuck...
Spent his entire life
believing that he killed his mother.
If you know anything...
that could take away even a second of that pain,
It would be cruel not to share it.
Otherwise,
leaving town means never having to say you're sorry.
Could there be a secret even B. can't crack?
Only time will tell.
Look, I was exhausted.
I was scared. I thought my mother was going to die.
He's a doctor. He knew people that could help her.
I had to seek him out.
I already knew about CeCe being sick
and I know that she got better.
and I'm not gonna sit here for another hour
while you talk around this thing.
What do you want me to tell you?
Tell me that you weren't with him
while I was home taking care of our kids.
Tell me that you didn't sleep with your ex-husband.
I didn't sleep with him.
I did kiss him,
But that's all.
Well, it must have been one hell of a kiss
for you to build all these lies around it.
Look, I-I-I promise. It d--it didn't mean anything.
We were engaged.
It means something to me.
Where are you going?
I need time to figure this out,
away from you.
Oh, Rufus, please, would you come back home so we can...
so we can work this out.
Hey. Hey, Vanessa. It's, uh, it's me.
I haven't heard from you in a while,
so I'm--I'm guessing that means you don't want to hear from me.
Um, but, uh,
Well, anyway, things around here aren't--
aren't so great right now.
You know, with my--my dad and Lily...
so I... I don't know.
If you get a minute, I-I could use a friend.
I think we're pushing our luck at this point.
Yeah.
We should go now.
Will you grab my jacket and dress, please?
Hey, I don't see it.
It's not here.
It's a perfect fit.
Well, I'm glad you're sticking around for a while.
Me, too. Here.
No.
This wasn't a date.
If you want one, you'll have to ask.
With enough time, eventually we all see
what was right in front of us...
Thank you. Don't mind us.
Oh, great service.
Hey, that--that girl's got my coat.
This was probably the best first date ever.
Promise me no more slow.
Well, what if it's the good kind of slow?
And realize no matter how long it took,
it was worth the wait.
Are you all right?
I spent 18 years
accepting the fact my mother was dead.
I was misguided... to let one of my father's girlfriends
allow me to question that,
to hope things may be different.
Your real mother would never turn her back
on a chance to know you.
I don't have a real mother, Blair.
I never will.
That doesn't mean you're alone.
I love you, Chuck,
And I'll always be your family.
But for some, that time never comes.
Instead of healing old wounds...
the wait just opens new ones...
Time after time.
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
