i could fall asleep at a play .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a one @-@ woman play called :
why don &apos;t you like me ? a bitter woman &apos;s journey through life .
that sounds interesting .
that does sound interesting .
to listen to a woman complain for two hours . i don &apos;t think it gets bet ..
i know ! i know . we can drive . we can vote . we can work .
what more do these broads want ?
well , you guys will have a great time . i promise .
what ? how come you don &apos;t have to go ?
i wish i could , but i found out ..
that i have to be at work really early the next day , so i can &apos;t go .
but take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want .
let &apos;s see . who do i hate ?
oh , sorry .
oops , sorry .
okay .
okay .

oh , gosh , okay !
all right .
can i ask you a question ?
do you think it &apos;s possible for two friends to fool around ..
and not have it be a big deal ?
no , i don &apos;t think that ever works . why ?
no reason .
no , no . rachel ?
who do you want to fool around with ?
nobody ! forget it .
joey ?
maybe .
you can &apos;t .
why ?
because !
okay , seriously , did not understand a word you just said .
in the hall .
okay .
you wanna fool around with joey ?
yeah .
ever since i had that dream about him , i can &apos;t get it out of my head .
i mean , what &apos;s the big deal ? people do it all the time .
who do you know that are friends that just fool around ?
okay . off the top of my head .. don and janet .
who are they ?
i know them from work .
both of them ?
no , just one of them .
which one ?
i don &apos;t know . what were the names i just said ?
no , rachel , things could get incredibly complicated .
all right . you &apos;re right . i won &apos;t do anything with joey . i just thought it ..
okay , so that &apos;s two cups of tarragon , one pound of baking soda and a red onion ?
what the hell are you cooking ?
the.one.with.the.soap.opera.party
you guys won &apos;t believe what i have to do for work today .
yes , but , ross , you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs .
there are these two professors who are joining my department ..
and i have to meet them here and show them around campus .
what &apos;s so bad about that ?
i just know they &apos;ll be a couple of old windbags ..
wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches .
ross ?
what ? these aren &apos;t suede .
excuse me . i &apos;m looking for someone .
you don &apos;t , by any chance , know a ross geller ?
no .
hi . hi , i &apos;m ross geller .
oh , hi . i &apos;m professor wheeler .
oh , that &apos;s .. that &apos;s .. that &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s good to meet you .
thank you so much for taking the time to show me around .
no , it &apos;s no big deal .
if i weren &apos;t doing this , i &apos;d just , you know , be at the gym working out .
is he gonna introduce us ?
i think we &apos;re just blurry shapes to him now .
by the way , i really enjoyed your paper ..
on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis .
i wrote that in one night .
twenty bucks says they &apos;re married within the month .
well , we should probably get going .
you know , we &apos;ve got a lot of ground to cover .
isn &apos;t another professor supposed to come with us ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m pretty sure . a professor spafford from cornell ?
well , he &apos;s obviously late , and the rule in my class is :
if you can &apos;t come on time , then don &apos;t come at all .
an option that many of my students use .
shall we ?
we shouldn &apos;t wait for him ?
you know what , he &apos;s a big boy . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll find us , okay ?
professor geller ?
oh , damn it !
hi , joey , it &apos;s jan rogers . can &apos; t wait for your party tonight .
listen , i forgot your address . can you give me a call ? thanks . bye .
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s a real shame you can &apos;t make it to that one @-@ woman show tonight .
i &apos;d love to , but i gotta get up so early the next day .
you know me , work comes first .
oh , yeah , yeah .
hi , joey , it &apos;s jan rogers . can &apos; t wait for your party tonight .
stupid jan rogers !
you are having a party tonight ?
no .
joey !
yeah .
i &apos;m kind of having a thing for the days of our lives people .
and you weren &apos;t gonna tell us ?
how did you think you were gonna get away with that ?
i do it every year .
you do that every year ? !
i didn &apos;t have to tell you that !
god , i &apos;m stupider than jan rogers !
that &apos;s why you got us tickets to that play , to get rid of us !
yeah .
last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant ?
yeah .
and the year before that , you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory ?
i can &apos;t believe you guys went for that one .
why wouldn &apos;t you invite us to your parties ?
you &apos;re fine , okay ? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people .
well , then , so just invite me .
please , i was trying to be nice . you &apos;re the worst one .
joey , come on ! please , please ? let me come . i will behave . i promise .
i will behave . please , please , please .
okay , fine . you can come .
but don &apos;t tell anybody else . it &apos;s up on the roof at 8 .
a soap @-@ opera roof party ? !
i &apos;m going to a soap @-@ opera roof party ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
and it &apos;s out of my system .
and then my wife and i went on a cruise to the galapagos .
there was a seafood buffet you wouldn &apos;t believe .
there were clams and mussels and oysters ..
and cracked crab ..
and snow crab ..
and king crab .
it &apos;s a pity i &apos;m allergic to shellfish .
so where did you get your undergraduate degree ?
and that &apos;s not all i &apos;m allergic to .
oh , it &apos;s not over .
i &apos;m also allergic to peanuts and cashews ..
and almonds and filberts ..
so basically all nuts !
interestingly , no .
you &apos;re kind of playing it fast and loose with the word &quot; interesting . &quot;
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m going to use the restroom .
when i come back , remind me to tell you ..
about the different types of animal dander i &apos;m allergic to .
oh , my god !
i &apos;ve lost the will to live .
let &apos;s ditch him .
what ?
while he &apos;s still in the bathroom . i am begging you .
okay . okay , fine , but i just have one question for you .
when we exit , should we walk or run ..
or prance or stroll .. ?
stop it ! stop it ! he talks slow , but he might pee fast . okay , let &apos;s move !
we actually managed to salvage the day .
yeah , we did .
thanks for spending so much time with me .
i &apos;m so lucky it worked out you don &apos;t have class on tuesday .
right .
oh , hey , you guys , this is charlie .
charlie , this is phoebe and my sister , monica .
hi .
charlie will be joining my department .
you &apos;re a paleontologist too ?
yeah .
oh , okay . now , what do you think ..
of renyard &apos;s new theory of species variegation in segmented arthropods ?
well , i think he &apos;s a little out there , but he does have some interesting ideas .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i have to take this . excuse me .
renyard &apos;s theory of species variegation ?
i saw the article on your coffee table . i memorized the title to freak you out .
so did you two have fun ?
oh , my god . she &apos;s great .
we have so much in common , and she &apos;s just cool , you know ? and funny .
and i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but she &apos;s a hottie !
hi !
hi , you guys . listen , you know what , i &apos;m not feeling really well ..
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna get to go to the play .
really ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know . i think it &apos;s kind of serious .
you know , i was watching this thing on tv this morning ..
about newcastle disease , and i think i might have it .
newcastle disease is a secretion @-@ borne virus ..
that only affects chickens and other poultry .
okay , who &apos;s this ?
i &apos;m sorry . rachel , this is charlie wheeler . she &apos;s a colleague .
hi . well , i would shake your hand ..
but i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to get my chicken disease .
rachel , can i see you for a second ?
sure .
you &apos;re not sick .
what ? yes , i am !
okay , then why are you all dressed up ?
when you &apos;re sick , you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better .
you just want to stay home so you can make a move on joey .
no , i heard you before . that is so not what this is .
okay , then what is this ?
okay .
joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof .
and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you .
what ? !
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof !
he didn &apos;t want you to know about it , but i came over here to tell you .
you came to say you were sick .
all right , professor or detective ?
wait , joey &apos;s having a party , and he wasn &apos;t gonna invite us ?
he does it every year . that &apos;s why he &apos;s sending you to the play .
that &apos;s why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory .
and that horrible museum tour ?
no , i arranged that .
hey , you guys , i &apos;m turning in . have fun .
we know about your party , joey .
what party ?
the game &apos;s over . take off your robe .
okay , i mean ..
close it up ! close it up !
nice to meet you .
hey , you made it ! all right !
glad you could make it . thanks for coming .
oh , my god . kyle lowder !
hi .
i love you !
hey . that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t invite you . you have to calm down , all right ?
just go get yourself a drink or something .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s what you want . my inhibitions lowered .
oh , my god , can you believe we &apos;re surrounded by all this ?
i can barely control myself .
monica , you might want to remember that you &apos;re married .
where is chandler anyway ?
oh , my god ! chandler !
where the hell is everybody ?
why don &apos;t you like me ?
chapter 1 : my first period .
hey , joey said no autographs .
but if she &apos;s getting one , i want one too !
&quot; to monica . &quot; and none of this &quot; best wishes &quot; crap . i want &quot; love . &quot;
okay , actually , mon , matthew was giving me his phone number .
oh , man ! if i had known i was coming to this party ..
i never would &apos;ve gotten married !
it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
call me .
we will !
look at you with all the guys ! i guess you &apos;ve forgotten all about joey .
yeah , well , i guess i have forgotten about joey .
and clearly , you &apos;ve forgotten about chandler .
please . chandler &apos;s the love of my life .
oh , leather pants ! have mercy !
so do you get to go to things like this often ?
come on , this is new york .
i mean , one night you &apos;re at a rooftop party filled with soap stars ..
and the next night , you &apos;re ..
who am i kidding , this is so cool .
so it &apos;s probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston , huh ?
actually , i &apos;m kind of happy to be leaving . i just broke up with someone .
oh , so sad .
still , it can &apos;t be easy for you to leave harvard .
especially after working with a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer .
actually , albie is the guy i broke up with .
you dated albert wintermeyer ?
yeah .
and you called him &quot; albie &quot; ?
i mean , that &apos;s like calling albert einstein ..
albie .
yeah , well , he is a brilliant man .
you think ? i mean , you dated the guy ..
who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10 !
yes , and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend ..
he had a lot of issues .
oh , like what ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t mean to pry . it &apos;s just that this must be ..
what regular people experience when they watch access hollywood .
okay , you want the dirt ?
albie was seriously insecure .
he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him .
who &apos;s intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize ?
a guy who won two .
two ? what .. ?
don &apos;t tell me you dated benjamin hobart ?
yeah , for three years .
oh , my god .
have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn &apos;t won the nobel prize ?
no .
but there was my first boyfriend , billy .
oh , yeah ? no nobel prizes for him ?
no , but he did just win the macarthur &quot; genius grant . &quot;
what a loser .
some more wine ?
hey , ross . how &apos;s it going with charlie ?
oh , great . after i finish my wine ..
i &apos;m gonna blow my average @-@ sized brains out .
what &apos;s the matter ?
she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners .
oh , my god , at the chinese restaurant earlier today ..
i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth .
i always loved that .
of course you would ! your brains are smaller than mine !
i can &apos;t compete with the guys she goes out with .
they &apos;re so out of my league .
oh , my god !
worse ?
oh , much , much worse .
i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians .
&quot; can we walk ? &quot;
oh , you like that ?
no .
what ?
come on ! i think that &apos;s funny !
woolly mammoth .
it &apos;s good !
i bet you &apos;re thinking that now would be a great time for an intermission , huh ?
oh , yes . god , yes .
well , you &apos;re not gonna get one !
because in life , there are no intermissions , people !
now , chapter 7 : divorce is a four @-@ letter word !
how could he leave me ? !
i don &apos;t know . you seem lovely .
ross , this is one of my costars , dirk . dirk , this is my good friend ross .
nice to meet you .
so , what show are you on ?
i &apos;m not an actor . i &apos;m a professor of paleontology .
that &apos;s science .
hey , well , listen , i play a scientist on days .
yeah , my character just won a nobel prize .
ross , dirk was wondering about the woman you brought and if you guys are together ?
well , no , but ..
i mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys .
hey , i got a 690 on my sats .
i &apos;d lead with that .
that &apos;s it . just sign right on the bra .
monica !
don &apos;t worry , joe . i won &apos;t come next year !
what the .. ?
what do you got there ?
just some boys gave me their phone numbers .
oh , really ? let me see .
damn , that &apos;s a lot of guys .
are you a little slutty ?
i think i am .
let me see if i approve of any of these clowns .
this guy wears a rug .
well ..
this guy &apos;s canadian .
oh , and this guy is in a cult , okay ?
it &apos;ll cost you $ 5000 to get to level three , and i don &apos;t feel any different .
pass . pa .. oh , pass . pass .
why ? what &apos;s wrong with these guys ?
well , nothing major .
it &apos;s just that , you know , they &apos;re not really good enough for you ..
and you deserve the best .
joey , you &apos;re so sweet .
it &apos;s true , but it doesn &apos;t matter . i already know who you &apos;re going home with .
who ?
me .
what ?
really ?
yeah , because we live together . it &apos;s a joke ! it &apos;s a joke .
right ! that &apos;s funny ! i get it !
got you !
you &apos;re funny , joey .
oh , my god .
so how did you enjoy the play ?
oh , my god . honey , i am so , so , so , so sorry .
well , you should be .
you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .
you really liked it ?
oh , yeah . i mean , at first i hated it .
but why wouldn &apos;t l ? because as a man , i &apos;ve been trained not to listen !
but after chapter 16 :
fat , single and ready to mingle ..
i was uplifted .
oh , really ?
oh , yeah .
i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman .
tell me .. tell me about your first period .
no !
did somebody sign your bra ?
so i got it when i was 13 . very difficult .
hey , ross ? so listen , about you and the dinosaur girl ?
are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ?
what is that ? come on , a piece of paper ?
it &apos;s actually a million @-@ dollar prize .
go , charlie !
but my point is ..
okay , so she dated them , but she also broke up with them .
maybe she &apos;s looking to , you know , slum it with some average joe ph.d.
yeah , maybe , and i do have my whole career in front of me .
i mean ..
i could still win a nobel prize .
although the last two papers i &apos;ve written were widely discredited .
you &apos;re so much more than just brains . you are sweet and kind and funny .
and sexy .
okay , well , give her a chance to see all that .
yeah . yeah . you &apos;re right .
thanks . i &apos;m gonna go find her .
good for you .
and your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was topnotch .
stop going through my stuff !
i just wanted to let you know i &apos;ve changed my mind .
i &apos;m gonna do it . i &apos;m gonna kiss joey .
no ! you can &apos;t ! friends hooking up is a bad idea .
please ! what about you and chandler ?
that &apos;s different . i was drunk and stupid .
well , hello ?
what about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from ?
why don &apos;t you just kiss one of them .
i could ..
but i don &apos;t want to . i want to kiss joey .
all right . i think it &apos;s a big mistake , but it &apos;s your decision .
i &apos;m gonna do it .
and i can &apos;t stop you ?
no .
well , can i at least have the phone numbers .
hey , rach , have you seen charlie anywhere ?
i &apos;m smarter than him !
hey , thank you so much for these tickets , chandler .
this was a really important experience for me and i wanted to share it with you .
you &apos;re so wonderful .
why don &apos;t you like me ?
chapter 1 : my first period .
