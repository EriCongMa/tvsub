but when it does , it &apos;s exciting .
okay , honey , you really need a job .
dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview .

on behalf of everyone , i &apos;d just like to say , &quot; huh ? &quot;
no , you just said &quot; dad . &quot; and everywhere i go today ...
... i keep getting signs telling me to go see my father .
like when i was walking over here and i passed a buffet .
which is my father &apos;s last name .
and they were serving franks ...
... which is his first name minus the &quot; s &quot; at the end .
and there was a rotisserie with a spinning chicken .

... to cheer himself up , you know ?
chandler

oh , no , wait a minute . i have no one .
let &apos;s go down there and get your hat back .

i went up !
what ?
my stock , meg , it went up two points .
do you realize that if i &apos;d invested my $ 127 in myself yesterday ...
... that l &apos;d , like , have a lot more than that today .

the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich .
what does that tell you ?
lf he &apos;s not going to eat it , i will .
are you crazy ?
he &apos;s just a little dog .
hey .
what ?
do you have to be a century 21 real @-@ estate agent ...
... to get to wear those cool jackets ?
do you say this stuff to girls ?
isn &apos;t that the guy who used to wear your hat ?
and look where they &apos;re sitting .
you &apos;re joking , right ? you guys just walked through the door .
maybe we didn &apos;t make it clear enough .
this couch belongs to us .
i &apos;ll tell you what , you call the couch ...
... and then we &apos;ll call the couch ...
... and we &apos;ll see who it comes to .
know what i don &apos;t like about you ? .you always got something to say .
well , that
you know , i keep wondering why you two are still sitting here .
all right , that &apos;s it .
i have had enough of this .
gunther .
these guys are trying to take our seat .
fellas , these guys were here first .
oh , sorry , didn &apos;t realize .
there you go .
thank you , gunther .
we didn &apos;t want to have to go and do that .
he told on us ?
you told on us ?
well , pal , you didn &apos;t give me much of a choice .
don &apos;t play with his thing .
i know .
all right .
let &apos;s take this outside .
&quot; let &apos;s take this outside ? &quot;
who talks like that ?
the guy who &apos;s about to kick your ass talks like that .
you had to ask .
okay , okay , look . see ...
... the thing is , we &apos;re not gonna fight you guys .
here &apos;s the deal .
you won &apos;t have to , so long as you never ever show your faces here again .
i think you played the gunther card too soon .
hey , pheebs , i think you &apos;re good to go .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i just think that this was a really bad sign .
like the beast at the threshold .
it &apos;s just i have no family left , except for my grandmother .
but let &apos;s face it , she &apos;s not gonna be around forever .
despite what she says .
and i have a sister who i &apos;ve barely spoken to since we shared a womb .
i don &apos;t know . this is my real father ...
... and i want things to be , like , just right .
i completely understand .
whatever you need .
hey , you want to go home ?
okay , thanks . sorry , again .
what was that ?
i &apos;m guessing the threshold &apos;s clear now .
i want to buy five shares of sgj . now .
come on , time is money , my friend !
thank you !
&quot; time is money , my friend ? &quot;
you missed &quot; takes money to make money ... &quot;
... and &quot; don &apos;t make me come down there and kick your wall street butt . &quot;
i made $ 17 before breakfast . what have you done ?
i had breakfast here , so technically i saved $ 3.50 .
how did you make $ 17 ?
well , my financially challenged friends ...
... i split my money and i bought some shares of chp and zxy .
how come those ?
well , chp because i used to have a crush on erik estrada .
and zxy because i think it sounds &quot; zexy . &quot;
what happened to meg ?
meg was good for me , but i dumped her .
my motto is , &quot; get out before they go down . &quot;
that is so not my motto .
how &apos;s the dog ?
okay . i talked to the vet . people are so nice upstate .
he said the little fella &apos;s gonna be okay , and i can get him tomorrow .
good .
thank god .
but he did have to have a bunch of stitches .
and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog &apos;s ear grow back .
so still hoping .
now are you going to call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay ?
i don &apos;t want to meet my father over the phone .
what will i say , &quot; hi , i &apos;m the daughter you abandoned .
oh , by the way , i broke your dog . &quot;
hey , pheebs , if you want , i &apos;ll do it .
listen , just don &apos;t say anything about me , okay ?
don &apos;t ...
... be too long with the phone .
she &apos;ll be a much better friend once the market closes .
it &apos;s a woman .
so talk to her .
hello , mrs. buffay .
i know where your dog is .
i want you to know he &apos;ll be returned to you almost as good as new ...
... within 24 hours .
goodbye .
why the voice ?
hard to say .
your cappuccino , sir .
thank you .
this is better than the coffeehouse .
absolutely .
how come it &apos;s not mixing with the water ?
the package says to keep it moving .
stir and drink , never let it settle .
this is ridiculous .
after i get back from my niece &apos;s christening ...
... i &apos;ll go to the coffeehouse with you and we &apos;ll have a cup of coffee .
no problem . joey &apos;s there .
i don &apos;t want to have to have joey with me every time i want decent coffee .
and i don &apos;t want to drink cappuccino with a &quot; k . &quot;
i say you and i go and stand up to those guys .
all right , hang on a second there , custer .
ross , have you ever been beaten up before ?
yeah , sure .
by someone besides monica ?
so what ?
so we get beaten up . maybe that &apos;s something a man has to go through .
like a rite of passage or something .
couldn &apos;t we just lose our virginities again ?
because i think actually mine &apos;s growing back .
are you with me or not ? . come on .
i &apos; m with you .
just ...
... iet me put on a clean pair of underwear for the hospital .
i need $ 100 .
what ?
welcome home .
i need $ 100 .
for what ?
to get back in the game .
when did you get out ?
i lost it all . i lost it .
i &apos;ve come to terms with it , you have to , too .
look , mon , i &apos;m really sorry .
where are we on the $ 100 ?
i don &apos;t have it .
but i need it !
otherwise , i &apos;ll have to take that diner job .
you know , with the dancing and the costumes .
i don &apos;t want to have to wear flame @-@ retardant boobs .
nobody does , honey .
noodle !
oh , my god . what the hell happened to my dog ?
it was an accident .
and the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose .
she &apos;s a vegetarian .
are these stitches ?
yeah , eight of them . that &apos;s 56 to him .
if it &apos;s raining , you can &apos;t let him look up ...
... because that cone will fill up fast .
thanks for bringing back what &apos;s left of him .
ls frank home ?
how do you know frank ?
just from a long time ago . is he here ?
yes , frank ?
what ?
i mean frank senior .
he went out for groceries .
will he be back soon ?
he left four years ago . we &apos;re expecting him back any minute .
i &apos;m gonna go .
i &apos;m sorry about the dog . everything .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , lady !
hey , wait up !
how do you know my dad ?
well , i don &apos;t really .
just genetically .
he &apos;s kind of my dad too .
heavy .
so did he ever talk about me ... phoebe ?
no , but he didn &apos;t really talk about anything .
except stilts .
stilts ?
yeah , he loved stilts .
one time , i was upstairs stealing cigarettes out of my mom &apos;s purse ...
... and all of a sudden i look over ...
... and there &apos;s dad &apos;s head , bobbing past the window .
he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving ...
... because he was happiest when he was on his stilts .
i don &apos;t know what to do with that .
me neither .
so are you , like , my big sister ?
this is huge . you can buy me beer !
i &apos;m not gonna .
but you know what &apos;s cool ? if you had a friend named pete , i could say ...
... &quot; i know pete . he &apos;s friends with my brother . &quot;
i got a friend named mark .
that &apos;ll work too .
cool . all right .
so maybe , you know , i could give you a call sometime .
we could talk or something .
yeah , that &apos;d be okay .
all right .
i &apos;m in the book .
so stilts , huh ?
if you want , i can show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter .
we did it . we &apos;re here . we are standing our ground .
how long does coffee take ?
would you come on ? come on !
thank you .
there we go .
i think we proved our point .
you burn your mouth ?
cannot feel my tongue .
bullies ! big bullies !
look who &apos;s here . it &apos;s the weenies .
did we not make ourselves clear the other day ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
yes , we &apos;re standing our ground .
apparently .
let &apos;s do this already .
you got a weapon ?
a nice watch . i don &apos;t want to break it on your ribs .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
question : if i don &apos;t care about my watch , can i use it as a weapon ?
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s sharp , it &apos;s metal .
i think i can do some serious damage with it .
no , you can &apos;t use your watch .
or your keys .
here &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
we &apos;ll put all keys and watches in the hat over there .
all right ?
all right , come on , man . let &apos;s do it !
before i forget , are we hitting faces ?
of course . why wouldn &apos;t you hit faces ?
i have to work on monday . i have a big presentation .
actually , i gotta show this apartment tomorrow ...
... and this no @-@ faces thing might not be a bad idea .
nothing from the neck up .
or the waist down .
dana &apos;s ovulating .
