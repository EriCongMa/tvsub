第一季 第八集
mom &apos;s having an affair.it &apos;s easy for me to say it .
mom , it &apos;s time for you to come home .
i was with my friend vanessa .
we &apos;re very close , and she moved away to vermont last year ,
and now she &apos;s back .
you said you love me .
dan , hungry ?
hello. hi .
hi .
nathaniel , i &apos;m shocked .
i thought you were strictly an herbal man .
the drugs were dad &apos;s .
i mean , i guess he thought it would be easier on everyone if i took the hit .
i have to say , every time i look at anne &apos;s finger
and see blair &apos;s future engagement ring ... ah .
i can hardly contain my joy .
it seems your father is facing some other charges .
for what ? embezzlement and fraud .
you should deal with your father .
he needs you. i don &apos;t .
where &apos;s nate ?
i think we just broke up .
what ?
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it. i just want to escape .
that &apos;s what this place is for , right ?
according to the catholic church ,
mortal sin can only be absolved
through the sacred act of confession ,
but it looks like a certain w.a.s.p. princess
has recently found herself desperately in need of a little unburdening .
and who is the man upstairs to discriminate ?
forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it &apos;s been ...
a while since my last confession .
what troubles you , my child ?
after being broken up with my boyfriend
for exactly 20 minutes , i ...
succumbed to inebriation ,
performed at a speakeasy
and surrendered my virtue to a self @-@ absorbed ass .
the only good news is that he &apos;s a total pig
who will act like it never happened. thank god. ahem .
sorry. truthfully , i &apos;m not even catholic .
you don &apos;t say .
but losing my virginity to chuck bass ?
none of my friends will ever understand .
i &apos;m ready for my punishment .
whatever you and god think is fair
flogging , fasting ,
putting that thing with the teeth around my thigh ,
like silas .
how about some food for thought instead ?
don &apos;t drink .
keep your clothes on .
try avoiding those who might cause you to stray .
oh , i plan to .
thank you , father. it was very good advice .
you don &apos;t grant birthday wishes , do you ?
i &apos;m a priest , not a genie .
well , the next time you talk to him ,
would you ask him to send my boyfriend back to me ?
mm. i gotta say ...
no need to say anything .
god , i hate people in love .
awkward .
vanessa ?
serena. dan .
no , no , no , no , no , no. vanessa &apos;s here .
ah. lovebirds ready to order ?
oh , i &apos;ll take &apos; em .
hi. so , uh , you--you work here now ?
i did mention that , but you &apos;ve been distracted .
vanessa. hi. nice to see you .
this time you &apos;re seeing less of me .
sorry about that. walking in when you were , you know ... yeah .
so you guys are up early. what &apos;d you do last night ?
oh , my god. i totally didn &apos;t mean to pry .
you &apos;re not prying. why would you think you &apos;re prying ?
no reason .
did you tell her ?
what ? no. what &apos;s to tell ? i know nothing ,
but if you guys did the thing i know nothing about ,
then i would totally support that. thanks , vanessa .
good to know in the event that should happen .
oh , meaning it didn &apos;t happen ?
meaning i don &apos;t even know what we &apos;re talking about right now .
i know i &apos;m lost. and i should get lost .
first day. i have lots of tables .
clearly .
so vanessa works here now .
yeah , we should make this our regular spot .
well , this is the last place i &apos;d expect to find you .
go away , chuck. i &apos;ve been given orders
practically from god himself to avoid you .
would you consider avoiding me over breakfast ?
sorry , but as is tradition on the day before my birthday ,
i &apos;m heading to the jeweler &apos;s to put some pieces on hold
for eleanor and
nate ? oh , i don &apos;t think
he &apos;ll be singing &quot; happy birthday &quot; this year .
no one knows that nate and i broke up ,
and it &apos;s gonna stay that way so i can fix this ,
and i don &apos;t think your best friend
would still be your best friend if he knew--
if he knew how much i enjoyed the removal
of a certain chastity belt in the back of this very limo ?
from this moment forward ,
the events of last night will never be mentioned again .
is that clear ? not as clear as the memory of you purring in my ear ,
which i have been replaying over and over .
well , erase the tape ,
because as far as i &apos;m concerned , it never happened .
i &apos;ll see you at your party tonight. you &apos;re officially uninvited .
never stopped me before .
speak of the devil ,
and he doth appear , wearing his trademark scarf .
careful , b .
hell hath no fury like a chuck bass scorned .
hey , dad .
hi , honey. how was hudson ?
your mother must have been kind of surprised to see you .
yeah , she was .
hi , rufus .
alison .
what are you doing here ? well ,
i asked her to come .
you know , i thought you guys could ... talk .
or not .
okay , dad , i know it wasn &apos;t my place to ask mom to come back ...
jenny .
it &apos;s your life. i get that , but it &apos;s my life , too ,
and it &apos;s dan &apos;s ,
and i just felt that nothing &apos;s ever gonna change
if someone doesn &apos;t do something .
jenny ! stop. breathe .
i &apos;m not angry .
you &apos;re not ?
not at you .
while you can &apos;t get un @-@ angry at mom if she &apos;s in hudson , and you &apos;re here , dad .
i mean , nothing &apos;s ever gonna change if you &apos;re not in the same room .
can &apos;t you just give it a chance ?
not on an empty stomach .
come. i &apos;ll make us breakfast .
who wants waffles ?
i mean , you do still like waffles , right , rufus ?
you know me , al .
i &apos;m a loyal guy. once i commit to something , i stick with it .
i &apos;ll get the syrup .
hey , mom. i just got back from the jeweler &apos;s ,
and i have to say--have you seen this ?
since when does drunk and disorderly get this much attention ?
since never .
the captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud .
this is an absolute disaster .
it must be awful for them .
i meant for me. the captain is supposed to represent me .
the contracts are about to be signed .
what about my i.p.o. , huh ?
what is gonna happen to my bendel &apos;s deal ? nate looks so helpless .
i have to call my attorney .
i @-@ i have to put an end to this deal before it goes any further .
i have to talk to nate .
i don &apos;t know why everybody &apos;s making such a big deal out of this .
it &apos;s just a misunderstanding. it &apos;ll be cleared up in time .
yes , it will , at your trial. this is real , howard .
the only reason you &apos;re not behind bars right now
is because your wife could afford your bail .
and i would &apos;ve paid ten times that amount .
you &apos;re not going to jail .
and we &apos;re gonna do everything we can to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen ,
but in the meantime , this is not something to be cavalier about .
it &apos;s clearly a setup. someone &apos;s got a agenda. dad ,
would you just shut up and listen to him ?
nate. look , sir , what exactly do we need to do here ?
remain calm and give them nothing but a united front
as we fight this. well , what about some sort of , um ,
some sort of plea ?
a plea ? you think i &apos;m guilty ?
dad , it &apos;s just a question .
how would that work exactly ?
it wouldn &apos;t. nate , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re very tired ,
and this is a conversation for adults .
why don &apos;t you go get some rest , sweetheart ?
hey , dad .
jenny .
and--and mom .
hi , honey .
well , look at this. the whole family &apos;s together ...
eating waffles .
want one ?
you bet .
just one question .
am i the only one who thinks this is extremely weird ?
i @-@ i mean , given everything .
dan , just forget about it .
if dad can let it go , so can you .
what do you mean , let it go ?
you know , the guy in hudson. you told her ?
no , of course i didn &apos;t tell her. rufus .
i would never .
i overheard dan and dad talking .
he heard us arguing on the phone .
yeah , if you want to keep secrets , maybe we should all
abandon the loft and move to a place with more walls .
it &apos;s always gogood to give him a while .
yeah , no , i knew--i knew that .
i can &apos;t believe he told her you guys were gonna do it .
well , i told you. that &apos;s different. i &apos;m a girl .
yeah , well , so is she .
exactly my point. but even if she wasn &apos;t ,
when you get a boyfriend , you become the best friend ,
and the best friend becomes the second best friend .
that &apos;s just how it has to be if it &apos;s ever gonna work .
hey , you still haven &apos;t told me how nate &apos;s doing .
it &apos;s all over the news .
uh , when i talked to him this morning ,
i @-@ i told him to focus on his family today .
but he &apos;s still coming to your party , right ?
here .
uh , i told him not to worry about it .
i mean , only if he &apos;s up to it .
you &apos;re such a good girlfriend , b . ,
really .
hey , um , i &apos;ll just pick you up , and we can go together ,
but i really hope nate can make it .
hey , take your earphones out .
take your earphones out .
nathaniel , i &apos;ve been calling you for 20 minutes .
i &apos;m sorry. what is it ?
blair &apos;s birthday party is tonight , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
i was thinking maybe you should give her something special .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s already picked out something at the jewelry store
and put it on hold .
something more special than that .
mom , that &apos;s a family heirloom .
i &apos;m not giving it to blair .
it &apos;s an engagement ring .
i &apos;m not asking you to propose , but it &apos;s important
that blair knows how much you value her loyalty .
her loyalty or her mother &apos;s ?
eleanor &apos;s lawyers may have called .
what difference does it make ?
one day we &apos;ll all be family ,
and they won &apos;t have a choice in these matters .
blair and i broke up last night .
well , then get back together .
i don &apos;t think so .
may i remind you it was your own rash actions
that got us into this predicament ?
we &apos;re in this predicament because dad has a drug problem .
i was trying to help him then help him .
your father &apos;s acting the way that he is because he &apos;s scared .
he needs you so much right now ,
more than he ever has .
we all do .
whoever thought monarchy was dead
didn &apos;t realize it just changed zip codes .
so what will it be , nate ,
blair waldorf &apos;s hand or your father &apos;s head ?
hi. are you okay ?
uh , i &apos;ve been texting you all day .
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine. thanks. i , um , just been a little busy .
i just wanted to check on you , see if you need anything .
yeah , i kinda do .
oh ?
um ... blair , do you think we &apos;ve been a little
a little hasty with the whole breakup ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , nate .
um , it was a pretty difficult decision .
yeah , look , i @-@ i totally understand .
i &apos;m sorry. i , um , i shouldn &apos;t have brought it up .
uh , but we do have a lot of history together ,
and , uh , it was in the heat of the moment ,
but you &apos;d have to be willing to really work for it .
yeah , yeah , of course .
listen , we &apos;ll just take it slow and see how it goes .
i &apos;ve got a birthday present for you .
it &apos;s , uh , something special .
i can &apos;t wait to open it at my party .
i &apos;ll see you there .
i ...
hi. this is blair waldorf .
i was wondering if any of the pieces that i put on hold
were picked up today .
the diamond necklace ? really ?
okay .
thank you .
thank you !
thank you .
thank you .
can we talk ?
well , that depends. are you--are you back for good ?
i don &apos;t know .
your father and i haven &apos;t really had a chance to talk , so ...
well , do you want to come back ,
or do you wanna live in hudson with , uh , neighbor guy ?
okay , look , dan , i understand that you &apos;re mad , all right ?
and i &apos;m not gonna defend what i did .
no , you--you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
you think i &apos;m only mad about the cheating ?
okay. what else ?
maybe that you promised you would be home
by the end of summer ,
and then you weren &apos;t .
maybe the fact that you left at all .
i asked if you were okay with me going away ,
and i &apos;d hoped that if there was a problem , you would say something .
like what ? &quot; your daughter &apos;s a freshman at a school
&quot; populated by mean girls
and date rapists ?
i think she needs her mom . &quot;
or maybe &quot; my father is madly in love with you
and will probably never get over this &quot; ?
why should i have to tell you this ?
where are you going ?
out. i &apos;ll call later .
well , that went well .
you know , i was thinking of going out also .
there &apos;s something i kinda need to do. oh , yeah. you need some help ?
can i help you ? no , i &apos;m good. thanks .
come on , man .
i can hear you breathing on the other side of the door .
is she anybody you can get rid of ?
i just really need to talk to you , man. please .
nathaniel .
where &apos;s the girl ?
in my dreams. i was trying to get some shut @-@ eye .
what &apos;s on your mind ? it &apos;s my mom .
sounds freudian .
she wants me to give blair her ring .
what ? you guys broke up .
yeah , i know. i mean , uh , wait. how do you know ?
predictably , your ex ran
the old , uh , grill @-@ the @-@ best @-@ friend play .
tried to find out where your head was at .
so , uh , where , uh , where is your head ?
spinning .
i mean , my mom wants me to get back with blair
so eleanor doesn &apos;t pull out of their business deal .
it &apos;s all because of my dad &apos;s whole trial thing , you know ?
yeah. i &apos;m sorry about all that ,
but look , if you &apos;re done with blair , be done .
don &apos;t cave to your parents &apos; wishes if they &apos;re not your desires .
excuse me ? where &apos;s my boy ?
&quot; seal the deal. tap that ass. money marries bigger money &quot; ?
look , i care about three things , nathaniel
money , the pleasures money brings me and you .
i &apos;m just trying to have your back here .
your parents have been controlling you your whole life .
if it doesn &apos;t end now , when will it ever ?
hey , serena ! blair !
happy birthday ! happy birthday !
oh , my god , kati. your brother &apos;s place looks fabulous .
yeah , i know , right ? i know. it &apos;s incredible. come on , guys .
let &apos;s check it out .
hai. douzo .
arigatou gozaimasu. douitashimashite .
thank you. hey .
so where &apos;s nate ?
um , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be here soon .
what about dan ? oh , uh , he said he &apos;s coming ,
but i haven &apos;t talked to him since this morning .
well , you better check in on him .
make sure the best friend hasn &apos;t whisked him away
to do some friendly activity. oh , shut up .
oh , there &apos;s chuck. i bet he knows where nate is .
i think nate probably just snuck in while we were dancing .
chuck .
well , thanks for listening to me complain about my family all afternoon .
i know it &apos;s hard right now ...
but your family &apos;s one of the good ones ,
and your parents really love each other .
they &apos;ll figure it out ,
and in the meantime , you &apos;ve got me .
um , actually , i was gonna go meet up with serena .
oh , sure. have fun .
i will. what are we doing ?
i thought you said we weren &apos;t doing anything .
i like serena , and i like you ,
and she likes me , and you like me ,
so how--how can you not like each other ?
it &apos;s mathematically impossible. who said i didn &apos;t like her ?
i just don &apos;t know her .
yeah , and you &apos;re making a real effort to change that .
i mean , why spend five minutes trying to be nice to serena ,
when i can spend day after day forced
to choose between the two of you ?
okay , fine. you want to see me get my nice on ?
let &apos;s do it tonight. just you , me and serena. um ...
tonight--tonight is blair waldorf &apos;s birthday party .
uh , i think we might want to start by dipping a toe
rather than diving off of a cliff ,
headfirst , into the rocks with the sharks .
why ? we all know how to swim .
come on .
you want to do this , let &apos;s do it .
are you ready for your present ? ow !
if you wanted to play rough , all you had to do was ask .
hi. hi. hello there .
happy birthday to me .
you nauseate me .
all this talk about how you have to be with nate
or the world will end .
face it. it &apos;s over .
you sound like a jealous boyfriend .
yeah , right. you wish .
no .
you wish .
please. you forget who you &apos;re talking to .
so do you .
do you ...
like me ?
define &quot; like . &quot;
uh , you have got to be kidding. i do not believe this .
how do you think i feel ?
i haven &apos;t slept. i feel sick ,
like there &apos;s something in my stomach , fluttering .
butterflies ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
this is not--not happening .
believe me , no one is more surprised or ashamed than i am .
chuck , you know that
i adore all of god &apos;s creatures
and the metaphors that they inspire ,
but ... those butterflies have got to be murdered .
fine. it wasn &apos;t that great anyway .
thanks .
jenny .
oh. hi , nate .
hey. i told blair ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have. i &apos;m sorry .
oh , about what happened at the ball ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s not your fault .
so ... how have things been between you guys ?
uh , strange ,
but again , not your fault .
so you gonna go inside ?
i was planning on it ,
but now that i &apos;m here , i &apos;m not so sure .
yeah. me neither .
blair invited me before our fight ,
and i was gonna run in and give her this card ,
which says &quot; i &apos;m sorry , &quot; like , 30 times .
maybe you could just deliver it for me , though ?
uh , do you wanna go take a walk or something ?
with you ?
um , what would blair think ?
well , blair &apos;s up there .
unless , of course , you wanna go .
it &apos;s up to you .
a walk sounds good .
thank you .
dan , you &apos;re here !
and , um , and you brought vanessa .
hey. good to see you .
um , kati and is , you--you know dan .
uh , blair , this is , um , dan &apos;s friend vanessa .
wow. you didn &apos;t mention they were so nice .
now i get it .
oh , sweetie , you did not tell me she looked like that .
this is such a problem .
rufus , i &apos;m sorry .
i know that you &apos;re upset .
you &apos;re getting that , huh ?
can you please talk to me ? please ?
i only have one question ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure i don &apos;t want to hear the answer .
it happened one time ,
and i wish it hadn &apos;t , and it &apos;s over .
then why did our daughter have to go to hudson
and drag you back here ?
because when we spoke on the phone ,
i didn &apos;t really get the impression that you wanted to see me .
i thought i should give you some space .
this family has had way too much space .
you never should have left .
can we not go through this whole thing again ?
please. you know that i wasn &apos;t happy .
yeah. you happy now ?
in some ways , i am .
i know you don &apos;t want to hear that .
look , please don &apos;t act like you care what i want .
rufus .
i was there for you when you were all about your music ,
when you were on the road for months at a time
and everything that went with it .
my whole adult life has been about you .
and now i &apos;m the one that &apos;s screwed up .
i guess i was a late bloomer .
i just need you to care enough about me to try .
alison ...
i care .
i care .
stalk me much ?
what are you still doing up here all alone ?
i don &apos;t know where nate is ,
and he always calls me at midnight ,
when it turns into my birthday .
well , i wouldn &apos;t count on it tonight .
doesn &apos;t it strike you as , uh , just a little bit of coincidence ,
the timing of everything ? what do you mean ?
well , nate suddenly decides he wants to get back together
just moments after your mother
puts the brakes on her deal with the captain ?
so you &apos;re saying that nate is only pretending to like me ,
and that he &apos;s actually using me to get to my mother ?
he wouldn &apos;t do that .
yes , he would .
if it was to help his family , you know he would .
nate loves me .
whatever he &apos;s doing , wherever he is ,
he will call at midnight. you &apos;ll see .
care to make a wager ?
if he calls , i &apos;ll leave you alone forever .
if he doesn &apos;t , you spend the night with me .
i will not .
i thought you were sure .
you &apos;re gonna lose .
he &apos;s never missed my birthday .
careful , b .
there &apos;s no safe wager when you bet on a bass .
you just might lose your shirt and your pants .
so you brought vanessa as your date to blair &apos;s party ?
no , no , you &apos;re my date .
i just thought it might be a good opportunity
for all three of us to hang out .
oh , yeah ,
cause it was so fun
and not remotely awkward at breakfast this morning .
fine. you &apos;re--you &apos;re--you &apos;re right. i actually thought
this would be a very bad opportunity for us to hang out ,
but i kind of suggested to vanessa
that she wasn &apos;t making an effort to get to know you ,
so , uh , she decided to start tonight ,
but if it &apos;s weird , i can go talk to her .
no. no , no , no , don &apos;t do that .
look , tell me something vanessa likes besides you ,
and i will make an effort to bond. i promise .
oh , thank you .
so what now ?
ever play &quot; guitar hero &quot; ?
thank you. thank you. oh , she owned you , serena .
yeah , you went down almost as hard as britney at the v.m.a.s.
okay , you know , you &apos;re good , vanessa .
i &apos;ll admit it , but i have been holding back until now .
there &apos;s a little birdie that &apos;s about to be free .
thank you. thank you. who got on now ?
not bad , but skynyrd is meat and potatoes ,
and i &apos;m bringing dessert ,
so what do you say to a slice of &quot; cherry pie &quot; ?
no pie. i say no , i beg you. come on .
there &apos;s nothing like a little &apos; 80s hair metal
to put a smile on your face. after the day you &apos;ve had ?
the--the day you &apos;ve had ? what--what kind of day have you had ?
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
uh , no. no , not yet. not yet .
um , it was kind of an odd day at the humphrey loft .
uh , actually , jenny brought my mom home .
your mom &apos;s back ?
yeah .
excuse me .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me your mom came home .
i &apos;m sorry , really. uh ...
what ? you didn &apos;t think it was important ? no , no , of course it is .
why bother ? you already told vanessa .
i tell vanessa everything , all right ?
i have since i was 6 .
well , you &apos;re not 6 anymore , dan .
i just--i was just hoping that i would be the person
that you would wanna tell these things to now .
i want you to be that person , too .
really , i do .
this whole girlfriend thing is very new to me , you know ?
i @-@ i just ...
i don &apos;t know all the rules yet .
well , blair says in a relationship , the best friend is--serena ,
you &apos;re really taking relationship advice from blair ?
good point .
look , i just don &apos;t want to have to compete with vanessa .
you know , with &quot; guitar hero , &quot; okay .
i &apos;m way more awesome , if you didn &apos;t happen to notice .
but , um , not with you .
that &apos;s fair .
all right , so tomorrow ,
you and i will go somewhere together , just the two of us ,
and we will talk about my family in excruciating detail
until you are--you &apos;re just so bored ,
you &apos;re begging for vanessa to take over , all right ?
how &apos;s that sound ?
perfect .
come on. it &apos;s almost midnight .
what happens at midnight ?
i heard about your dad .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
my family &apos;s not doing that great right now either .
you know , i actually didn &apos;t want to come to blair &apos;s party
as much as i just wanted to get out of my house .
yeah , i know the feeling .
blair &apos;s birthday present .
your mother &apos;s ring .
blair told me about it .
wow. it &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;m , uh , supposed to give it to blair tonight .
i &apos;m guessing that wasn &apos;t your idea .
blair and i broke up ,
and i know it was the right thing to do .
i mean , we just shouldn &apos;t be together right now , you know ?
sounds like you &apos;re pretty sure of that .
i am , and as much as i wanna do the right thing and help out my parents ,
it &apos;s just--it &apos;s not fair .
i mean , to me or to blair .
i just think that if i do this now ,
when does it ever stop ?
it &apos;ll only stop when you stop it .
12 : 01. i &apos;m sorry .
no , you &apos;re smarmy. there &apos;s a difference .
if you &apos;re coming to collect , you can forget it .
turn around .
you get grosser by the second .
you get older. look .
happy birthday !
blair , blow out your candles .
make a wish , blair .
it already didn &apos;t come true .
happy birthday to who ?
forget cake and ice cream .
i &apos;m saving room for just desserts .
looks like chuck &apos;s wish might come true .
so i don &apos;t know how it was possible iven how the day started ,
but , um , i actually had kind of a good night .
your parents won &apos;t be mad you &apos;re coming home so late , right ?
oh , no , they think i &apos;m with a friend .
huh. well , they think right .
i had fun .
me , too. you have a good night .
spotted--nate archibald depositing
a mystery girl n a taxi after midnight .
all we know about her for sure ?
she &apos;s not blair waldorf .
oh , my god
may be she is wrong , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
hey , blair , i am so sorry
ver would &apos;ve thought that this would happen .
i hope the slut gave him herpes .
cheater totally deserves herpes .
he isn &apos;t cheating .
we broke up , okay ?
he was gonna get back together with me ,
but only so my mom would help his dad .
you satisfied ?
blair
blair , stop , you can talk to me
we ended it .
wanted to tell you , but--but part of me thought that
if i didn &apos;t say it out loud , then it wouldn &apos;t be true .
it was my birthday wish for us to get back together .
now i think it &apos;s really over .
oh , blair , shh .
is it okay if i just wanna be alone for a second ?
nate , hey. what are you doing home so early ?
it &apos;s after midnight .
we just thought you &apos;d be with blair .
how did she like her gift ?
i didn &apos;t make it to the party tonight .
well , her actual birthday is today .
you can call her in the morning , maybe take her to lunch .
it &apos;s a good plan. really more special this way .
dad , i know you think blair will help save you ,
but i &apos;m not doing this .
it &apos;s over .
nate .
there &apos;s nothing in this world wouldn &apos;t do to protect our family ,
and i &apos;m sure you feel the same .
i need your support here , son , and your trust .
well , you better hope for your sake ey don &apos;t call your son to the stand .
god , i have missed your smile .
mm. i have missed everything .
please tell me that is someone coming to rob the house .
hey , mom .
hey , dad .
hey , jenny .
as you were .
s your friend gonna be okay ?
um , i &apos;m not sure .
she just broke up with her boyfriend ,
and then they got back together and then , um ,
i don &apos;t know what just happened .
well , she &apos;s lucky to have you .
being a good friend is ...
challenging at times ?
hey , if i &apos;ve been acting however i &apos;ve been acting ,
it &apos;s just &apos; cause i &apos;m protective of dan .
and i &apos;m protective of our relationship .
i &apos;ve never actually had one before .
you guys just have everything in common ,
and , um , i &apos;m just getting to know him .
so , you know , it can be a little intimidating .
talk about intimidating .
you just admitted that you find me intimidating ,
so how cool does that make you ?
i think you forgot to mention
y superior &quot; guitar hero &quot; skills .
no , i didn &apos;t forget that .
and at the next party , i &apos;m asking for a rematch ,
cause you were about to get smoked .
oh , really ? well , i think the only thing getting smoked
is your pale imitation of a guitar player .
hey , i am a golden god .
oh , really ? are you now ? hey. am--am i interrupting anything ?
um , actually , you are .
i &apos;ll give you guys a moment .
might that have been bonding that i just walked in on ?
a little bit .
yeah ? what were you talking about ?
nothing you need to know about .
oh , so you have secrets now ? i see .
well , listen , um , if you want to get out of here ,
vanessa can only fit two on her vespa ,
but i can walk .
oh , well , you know i love me a vespa ,
but , um , i think i gotta stay here and be with blair .
you &apos;re not the only one with a best friend .
i &apos;m not in the mood , chuck .
this is pretty much the worst birthday ever .
maybe it can be salvaged .
is that our sex tape ?
it &apos;s the erickson beamon necklace .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
yes , you can .
something this beautiful
deserves to be seen on someone worthy of its beauty .
i really am sorry .
spotted--b. turning a year older ,
but not necessarily wiser .
guess chuck &apos;s the gift that keeps on giving .
blow out your candles , b .
this will be better in the dark .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
