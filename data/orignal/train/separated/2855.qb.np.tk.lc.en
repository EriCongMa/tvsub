we &apos;re very happy for you.what &apos;s the matter ?
we wanted to kiss at midnight , but nobody else will , so ....
all right , i &apos;ll take care of it .
it &apos;s 30 seconds to midnight , what are you gonna do ?
will you just trust me ?
thirty @-@ three , 32,31
who are you kissing at midnight ? rachel or phoebe ?
you can &apos;t kiss your sister .
who &apos;s gonna kiss my sister ?
chandler .
oh , man ! really ?
would you rather have me or him kiss her ?
that &apos;s a good point .
since i have that whole history with rachel , i guess phoebe .
okay
phoebe ! listen . ross wants to kiss you at midnight .
so obvious . why doesn &apos;t he just ask ?
rach ! i &apos;m gonna kiss you at midnight .
what ?
you can &apos;t kiss ross . you got the history .
so ? -would you prefer me or chandler ?
good point .
three , two , one ! happy new year !
happy new year .
happy new year .
happy new year .
you too .
happy new year , joey .
so that do anything for you ?
the one with all the resolutions
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb and say &quot; no divorces in &apos; 99 ! &quot;
but your divorce isn &apos;t final yet .
just the one divorce in &apos; 99 !
i am gonna be happy this year . i am gonna make myself happy .
do you want us to leave the room ?
every day i am gonna do one thing i have never done before .
that is my new year &apos;s resolution .
that &apos;s a good one ! mine is to pilot a commercial jet .
now you only have to find a planeload of people ...
... whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths .
maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends .
especially the ones who might fly you to europe for free .
she has a better chance of flying up your nose ... than you do of not making fun of us .
i &apos;ll bet $ 50 you can &apos;t go the year without making fun of us .
better yet , a week.i &apos;ll take that bet , my friend .
paying me the $ 50 can be ... the &quot; new thing you do &quot; that day .
and it starts right now !
my new year &apos;s resolution is to learn how to play guitar .
really ? how come ?
you know those special skills i have listed on my resume ?
i would love it if one of those was true .
want me to teach you ? i &apos;m a great teacher .
really ? who have you taught ?
well , i taught me . and i loved me .
that &apos;d be great ! yeah , thanks , phoebe .
my resolution is to be less obsessed with being neat and clean .
really ?
no
or something else .
look . blaire forgot her glasses.she &apos;ll need these to keep an eye on that boyfriend .
who , from what i hear , needs to keep his stapler ... in his desk drawer , if you know what i mean !
maybe your resolution should be to gossip less .
what ? i don &apos;t gossip .
maybe sometimes i find out things.or i hear something and i pass that information on .
you know , kind of like a public service .
it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m a gossip . is ted koppel a gossip ?
if ted koppel talked about his coworkers &apos; botched boob jobs , i would .
they were like this !
fine , my new year &apos;s resolution will be not to gossip .
it &apos;s easy .
easy ? you have never kept a resolution .
yes , i have .
okay , let &apos;s see how you did last year .
no . no . not my diary . you cannot read my diary .
&quot; dear diary : i &apos;m so excited.my resolution is to write in you every day .
see you tomorrow . &quot;
nothing .
you know , not a lot happened last year .
all right , i will prove to you that i can keep it this time . no more gossiping .
i hate gossip . in junior high ...
this girl said a lot of mean stuff about me and i set her bike on fire .
wow , what did she say about you ?
she said i was crazy .
but i guess she got hers .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
okay .
i just asked that girl out.nice !
is that part of your &quot; new thing &quot; for today ?
yes , it is . see ?
&quot; elizabeth ... hornswoggle &quot; ?
that &apos;s right.elizabeth hornswoggle .
hornswoggle
you okay , chandler ? something funny about that name ?
no , i just think i &apos;ve heard it somewhere before .
oh , really ? where ? somewhere funny , i &apos;ll bet .
guess what .
i have a date with elizabeth hornswoggle .
hornswoggle ? oh , this must be killing you !
not really .
i haven &apos;t told you her middle name yet .
well , don &apos;t . just don &apos;t .
see you later . -see you .
all right , phoebe , i am ready for my first lesson .
no , you don &apos;t touch the guitar .
first you learn here , then here .
okay
lesson one : chords .
now , i don &apos;t know the actual names of the chords .
but i made up names for the way my hand looks while i &apos;m doing them .
so then this is &quot; bear claw . &quot;
&quot; turkey leg ... &quot;
... and &quot; old lady . &quot;
what an interesting approach to guitar instruction .
you know , some might find it amusing . i myself find it regular .
hey , everybody ! rachel was so good today . she didn &apos;t gossip at all .
i didn &apos;t . even when i found out
let &apos;s say i found out something about someone ... and let &apos;s just say.she &apos;s gonna keep it
check this out .
you nailed the old lady !
i thought i was getting better , so i stopped by this guitar store
did you touch any of the guitars there ?
did you ?
no .
give me your hands .
strings .

do you want to learn to play guitar ?
yes .

auntie monica !
ross is wearing leather pants !
does nobody else see ross is wearing leather pants ?
someone comment on the pants !
i think they &apos;re very nice .
i really like them a lot .
not what i had in mind .
people like ross don &apos;t wear these types of pants .
you see , they &apos;re very tight .
maybe there &apos;s something in that area ?
i think they look really good .
where &apos;d you get them ?
i needed a new thing for today .
there &apos;s this leather store that always smells so good .
and i thought to myself : &quot; wow . i &apos;ve never owned ... a really good @-@ smelling pair of pants before . &quot;
oh , come on !
what do you think ?
you look like a freak.awful !
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s my new year &apos;s resolution .

no , i &apos;m not questioning it . i &apos;m saying it &apos;s stupid !
what ?
thank you .
you know , none of my other student .... thought i was stupid .
your other student was you !
well , maybe you just need to try a little harder !
maybe i need to try a real teacher !
here ! andy cooper . he teaches guitar.there &apos;s a picture of him with a kid .
and the kid &apos;s got a guitar !
fine ! you learn from your &quot; qualified instructor . &quot;
but don &apos;t come crying when everyone is sick ... of hearing you play &quot; bad , bad leroy brown &quot; !
baddest man in the whole damn town
oh , fine . take his side !
i can &apos;t wait to be with you .
i &apos;ll sneak over as soon as i can .
i &apos;ll tell rachel i &apos;ll be doing laundry .

chandler &apos;s not here.you can help me .
okay
i &apos;m in elizabeth &apos;s bathroom .
nice !
no , i got really hot in my pants , so i took them off .
but they must have shrunk from the sweat.or my legs expanded from the heat .
i can &apos;t get them back on , joey . i can &apos;t !
that is quite a situation .
do you see any powder ?
powder ! yeah , i have powder .
good , good.sprinkle some on . it &apos;ll absorb moisture.then you can get your pants on .
yeah , hold on .
they &apos;re not coming on , man .
okay , cut slits in the pants , right ? then put them back on ...
... go out there and tell her you &apos;re the lncredible hulk .
chandler &apos;s not there ?
that would have worked , but all right , fine .
you see any .... oh , vaseline ?
i see lotion . i have lotion . will that work ?
sure , throw some of that on there.hold on .
sounds like it &apos;s working .
they &apos;re still not coming on , man.and the lotion and the powder have made a paste .
really.what color is it ?
what difference does that make ?
if the paste matches the pants , you can make paste pants ...
... and she won &apos;t know !

no , no , no ! i don &apos;t want to know .
you do want to know . this is unbelievable !
i &apos;m tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets ... and can &apos;t tell anyone .
you know secrets ?
you &apos;re not supposed to gossip !
i can &apos;t keep this in . so i pick up the phone
i &apos;m not listening to you !
you &apos;ve been in there for a long time .
i &apos;m starting to get kind of freaked out .

oh , my god !
i had a problem .
phoebe
i can &apos;t talk to you . i don &apos;t have a fancy ad in the yellow pages .
look phoebe , i just
i want to apologize for saying your method was stupid .
and maybe ask you to be my teacher again ?
i promise , i won &apos;t touch a guitar until you say i &apos;m ready .
you really think i &apos;m ready ?
wow , cool !
