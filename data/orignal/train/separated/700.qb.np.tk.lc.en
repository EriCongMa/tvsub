we have reason to believe that you have information
about the abduction of charlotte clarke .
we &apos;re gonna need you to come down to the station
for some questioning .
you are officially my second @-@ in @-@ command .
gideon ? what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re my big sister and my boss .
my sister stole the company out from under me .
you take the reins , and we partner up .
now we have the photo we &apos;ll use to blackmail danny .
this isn &apos;t how i do business .
well , it is now .
people think i hate you ,
no one looks at me when you &apos;re gone .
transportation will meet you about a mile south .
david ?
now this is where it all ends . fitting .
what have you done ?
you needed help .
i had no choice but to check you in .
help me !
goodbye , victoria .
she &apos;s amanda clarke ! she &apos;s amanda clarke ! !
she &apos;s amanda clarke !
in my lifetime , i &apos;ve come to understand
that there are three ways for a person to disappear .
the first is to die .
the second is to lie .
and the last is to be reborn .
it was after my former husband &apos;s death six months ago
that my transformation began .
i made my peace with those who have wronged me
and with those who i &apos;ve wronged ,
no one more so than emily thorne .
thus , after months of denial ,
i &apos;ve come to see my time here in claremont as a renaissance .
and i understand that the trauma i suffered
seeing my murdered fiance led to my delusions ,
from which i &apos;m now free .
never lose hope , victoria .
with your help , i won &apos;t , phyllis .
and on that note of camaraderie , we are done for the morning .
thank you , ladies .
it appears you &apos;ve actually made a friend .
oh , i &apos;ve made many , dr. miller .
you simply have simply chosen not to notice .
well , perhaps here comes another .
you know , i think i may have left something back in my car .
ma &apos;am , you can &apos;t leave .
you need to come with me .
she has quite an elegance .
are you saying that i don &apos;t ? !
is that what you &apos;re saying ? !
because i am the belle of this ball !
you said we were best friends and i was your favorite ,
and get your hands off of me !
you lied to me !
maybe you were better off alone .
maybe we all are , dr. miller .
well , there &apos;s a lot of names in the hopper .
erase @-@ on manor . thornehill . the ross supremacy .
emily &apos;s still taking pictures ,
but as far as the party signage goes ,
a &quot; happy memorial day &quot; will do .
the house doesn &apos;t need a name , nolan .
says the girl who doesn &apos;t know which one to use for herself .
i do . you just won &apos;t accept it .
oh , ems , i think i &apos;ve accepted a lot .
like when you said you wanted to buy this house ,
i redecorated .
you wanted to open the season here ,
i &apos;m co @-@ hosting the party .
i &apos;m just hoping that your secret plan
is to make your debut there as amanda clarke .
sorry . i &apos;m emily thorne , and it &apos;s simply a party .
after what the graysons put us through ,
don &apos;t you think we deserve one ?
so there won &apos;t be any poisonings ?
&apos;fraid not .
no arrests or blackmailings ?
nope .
no takedowns whatsoever ?
conrad &apos;s dead , i committed victoria ,
and daniel &apos;s self @-@ destructing all on his own .
so , unless you can think of someone ...
nope . i can &apos;t . don &apos;t want to .
then stop questioning me , and let &apos;s enjoy the summer .
hey , ems , know what they said
about the girl who gave up revenge ?
she lived happily ever after .
going somewhere ?
yeah .
i was just about to come find you .
it &apos;s time .
you sure ?
it &apos;s now or never .
someday i will repay you .
but where are you gonna go ?
southampton .
i got some unfinished business .
i &apos;ll be sending you the bill for her overtime .
yeah , please do .
penthouse &quot; b &quot; at the ripley .
oh , you live in a luxury hotel now ?
doing what you can to try and salvage the grayson lifestyle .
you &apos;ve certainly profited from my family &apos;s downfall .
you expect me to protect your reputation
after what you did ?
i made you my second @-@ in @-@ command , my partner ,
but then you quit with no warning
and still no explanation .
yeah . you &apos;re not the only one enduring family tragedies .
well , then , you should be fighting to rebuild your life
instead of feeding your libido .
oh , now i &apos;m supposed to take your advice ?
save your concern for your brother .
oh , i can handle him .
at least with gideon , there are no surprises .
you have the right to remain silent .
and you have the right to buy us drinks tonight .
precinct rules ... rookie pays .
hey , quit hazing my probie .
don &apos;t worry , porter . keller &apos;s a cheap date .
one beer and he &apos;s under the table .
you should talk , hunter .
so , you want to go throw back a few ?
huh ? on me ?
uh , i can &apos;t .
i got to pick carl up from daycare
and don &apos;t have a sitter tonight .
i hear that .
i was raised by a single dad .
yeah , a lot of grilled cheese for breakfast ,
pancakes for dinner .
so , first day out there . how &apos;d you feel ?
green as hell .
hope i didn &apos;t make you nervous .
what , on our three traffic stops and one domestic ?
just remember two things , all right ?
why you became a cop and that i got your back .
why did you become a cop ?
well , the bar is doing okay
but not enough for a college fund .
i guess i thought this would be good for the soul .
i &apos;ve just seen too many people get away with murder and ...
i finally wanted the power to do something about it .
really ?
so you aren &apos;t doing this so that you can start
arresting people instead of kidnapping them ?
never gonna live that down , am i ?
no . no , you got to own it .
i mean , how many of us can actually say
that we &apos;ve been detained for a class &quot; b &quot; felony ?
amazing .
wow , my fitting went swimmingly .
my party outfit is kind of epic , even for me .
are we playing musical chairs ?
i figured i &apos;d drive us home .
ems , i told you .
i had this little minx custom @-@ made
for our summer of fun ,
but there is only one blond allowed behind the wheel .
look , if you want me to embrace a new life ,
then maybe you should embrace some new rules .
hop in .
oh , my god !
are they all right ?
i &apos;ll buy you a new one .
are you blind ? !
i am so sorry . i &apos;m not used to driving this car .
unreal .
you know , every summer , you people come flocking in here
like you own this town .
oh , this is just fanta ... you know what ?
just ... just give me your insurance .
oh , we don &apos;t need to hassle with that . i &apos;ll just cover it .
must be nice living in your world .
just bring me the estimate .
i &apos;m in the house on the east edge of coopers beach .
the old grayson manner .
this is why we need a name .
oh , you &apos;re emily thorne .
yeah , i heard you bought that place .
been listening to my customers
yapping about your party all week .
well , why don &apos;t you come ?
bring the estimate then ,
and you &apos;ll see we &apos;re not all that bad .
you know what ?
if that &apos;s the soonest i can get the check from you , fine .
perfect . we &apos;ll see you then .
yeah .
and , again , i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
look at you ... solving conflict without a red sharpie .
i &apos;ll drive .
charlotte !
there &apos;s daddy . say hello , carl .
what the hell ?
you don &apos;t talk to me for six months
and then out of the blue you pick him up from daycare ?
come here .
i missed the little guy .
you know what that was like for me ?
not knowing where he is , not being able to find him ?
and how &apos;s that feel , jack ?
that fear , that knot in your stomach ?
thought i &apos;d remind you who you really are
after your first day on the job .
protect and serve , right ?
that &apos;s not what you did for me
when you tied me up in that room .
i told you again and again , it wasn &apos;t me .
then look me in the eye and say it .
after all this time , you still can &apos;t , can you , jack ?
charlotte , you &apos;re just gonna have to let this go .
calm down , jack . you &apos;re scaring your son .
poor little guy ...
being raised by a dirty cop .
i had a premonition .
it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; it &apos;s going to rain again .
&quot; rain every day , as though to spite me .
&quot; i might as well hang myself . &quot;
it &apos;s chekhov .
i like it . especially the end .
it worked .
how did you know the orderly would have it on him ?
because his wife is due in two weeks ,
which is when men think
they &apos;re suddenly vital to the process .
i haven &apos;t had that much fun in years ...
without acid .
phyllis , thank you .
cheers .
the long island harbor conservancy
appreciates your fundraising efforts , ms. thorne .
well , i couldn &apos;t imagine a better event
to break in my new home or christen your new yacht , dennis .
she looks like a beauty .
well , she is ,
just as beautiful as the woman i named it for .
you have no idea how embarrassing it is
to have your name painted on the side of a boat .
i think it &apos;s an honor .
fortunately , you have a lovely name like jennifer .
so , what happened to your last yacht ?
i &apos;m surprised you hadn &apos;t heard .
it was involved in an accident last summer
with a small fishing boat .
a man was killed .
yes , i remember .
but your skipper took it out for a joyride , right ?
that &apos;s right , yeah .
it &apos;s just so horrible to think about .
excuse me .
hello ?
this is victoria grayson .
i &apos;m being held captive at claremont institu ...
i know exactly where you are , victoria .
what are you doing in my house ?
i &apos;m paying the mortgage .
you should see what i &apos;ve done with the place .
i changed everything except the phone number ,
a precaution i &apos;m sure you now understand .
please .
i &apos;ve hurt you . i admit it .
but you &apos;ve hurt me , too .
i just want to end this cycle , please .
and i want my childhood .
i want aiden .
and i want pascal back .
you led him to his death .
you insinuated your way into my family .
you have earned your pain .
you are exactly where you belong , victoria ,
ranting on like a lunatic .
for the record , conrad slaughtered pascal , not me .
and as for everything else i did ...
i would do it all again .
sorry you wasted your call .
nolan was wrong .
you don &apos;t look anything like a stripper .
jack , you don &apos;t need to keep coming over to check in on me .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m not .
charlotte took carl from daycare .
what ?
he &apos;s fine .
she just ... she just did it to scare me , and it worked .
my ... my partner asked me today why i became a cop .
he joked that it had something to do with the kidnapping .
well , he was right , wasn &apos;t he ?
it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
i first thought about joining the force
after amanda &apos;s murder
and again after my brother was killed .
i hated the powerlessness ,
&apos;cause i knew that conrad had the cops in his pocket .
i knew that if i became a cop , no one could pay me off .
so why didn &apos;t you join back then ?
because i learned who you were .
listen , at the academy , they drum into us this idea
that we &apos;re working for the greater good .
and i know that that &apos;s what you were doing in your own way ,
but you know i was never okay with that .
you were waiting for me to be done .
jack , you didn &apos;t have to put your life on hold to protect me .
well , i &apos;m just glad that it &apos;s over ...
that you &apos;re moving on .
ma &apos;am ?
we &apos;re ready .
i &apos;ll be right with you .
and , look , in case there was ever any doubt
as to why i stayed in the hamptons ,
it was for charlotte .
she &apos;s the only family i have ,
and one way or another , i will make it better .
so , you heard from mom ?
yeah , the postcards stopped coming .
last one said she was in amsterdam .
i still can &apos;t believe she ditched us to save herself .
can &apos;t you ?
when the government took everything ,
she was the first rat off the ship .
well , at least you still have the money you made at lemarchal .
speaking of , would you mind covering my rent again ?
char , we talked about this .
you know i don &apos;t love you living alone downtown .
why don &apos;t you move in with me ?
you just want to keep me under your thumb .
yeah , you &apos;re right . i do .
i barely hear from you , and i @-@ i worry .
with what you &apos;ve been through , you need a support system .
i &apos;m doing fine , thanks .
well , then , do fine here with your brother .
it &apos;s no grayson manor , but ...
yeah , you know , emily &apos;s throwing
her memorial day party there tomorrow .
she even had the gall to invite me .
well , that bitch never knows when to quit , does she ?
yeah , neither do i.
now , how about that rent check ?
yeah , how ... how ... how much was it again ?
five grand ?
seven .
seven grand ?
is that okay ?
anything for my little sister .
hope you don &apos;t mind they put me in here .
not as long as you stop crying .
this place doesn &apos;t deserve your tears .
i &apos;m louise -- louise ellis .
victoria grayson .
as in conrad grayson ?
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
i &apos;m not .
that man was a tyrant .
i see that you &apos;ve overpacked .
mother said she was sending me
to a health spa to rejuvenate .
if you &apos;re worried that i might cut you in your sleep ,
i &apos;m not crazy .
that &apos;s too bad .
sanity &apos;s your enemy here .
i spun out a bit after my daddy died last year .
he drank himself to death .
my mom &apos;s been trying to convince me i &apos;m still screwed up ,
that i need time to figure things out .
i can &apos;t imagine choosing this for your child .
well , then , you &apos;re a better mother than mine .
well , you &apos;ll soon learn that this place is a prison ,
and dr. miller is its well @-@ paid warden .
took me six months just to obtain a phone .
but you did call somebody , didn &apos;t you ?
sadly , i reached the very devil who committed me .
well , you must know another way out .
please .
i will lose it in here ,
which i &apos;m sure is exactly what my mother wants .
poor poppet .
enjoy the trappings of your former life
while you still have them ,
because they take everything away from you here .
maybe we should let them .
you better not disappear on me again .
i won &apos;t , amanda .
aiden ?
no .
no !
okay . go ahead .
you made it .
yeah .
yeah .
this check is for you .
that &apos;s -- it &apos;s too much . i mean , the estimate &apos;s only --
please , please . to cover the hassle .
thank you .
look , i &apos;m sorry i blew up at you the other day .
just -- just been a really crappy year , you know .
and i guess i just -- i @-@ i expect the worst of people .
believe me , i &apos;ve been there .
not so sure you have .
just had a really short fuse ever since i lost my fiance .
too much too soon , i know .
no , no . not at all .
i lost someone , too .
and to be completely honest , it &apos;s been hard
to find someone who understands what i went through . so ...
i &apos;m glad you came , nancy . would you stay ?
yeah .
every queen of the hamptons needs her throne .
and this one even has room for her jester .
you like ?
i love .
long live the new queen .
cheers !
look at her ,
rubbing my nose in everything that &apos;s happened .
why don &apos;t we just rub our noses
into something a little bit more fun ?
right after i say hi to the hostess .
okay .
thank you for coming , charlotte .
i only accepted your invite
because i thought after all this time ,
maybe you &apos;d surprise me ,
but my mom was right , wasn &apos;t she ?
this is all you ever wanted --
this lifestyle , this house .
i wish you &apos;d give me a chance to explain .
why would i give you anything , emily ?
when you want something , you just take it .
wanted one of these
ever since i saw &quot; goldfinger &quot; as a kid .
so why are you letting her go ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i realized some things in life
were more important than pretending to be james bond .
really ?
rumor is you &apos;ve been selling anything that &apos;s not nailed down
so you can keep pretending your fortune didn &apos;t sink
along with your family &apos;s .
if you think you know so much , then why the hell did you ask ?
we agreed to a lot more than this .
supply and demand , grayson ,
and your name doesn &apos;t intimidate people the way it used to .
so why don &apos;t you just hand me the keys ?
listen to me , you son of a bitch ,
if i read about this sale in &quot; page six &quot;
or in your family christmas news letter ,
you &apos;ll see just how intimidating i can be .
now get out of here .
jennifer ?
you all right ?
nervous , i guess .
i &apos;ve never christened a boat before .
champagne ?
well , don &apos;t worry .
it won &apos;t feel a thing .
thank you . cheers .
cheers .
margaux .
i wanted to say thank you for the donation
and for accepting my invitation .
since i &apos;m covering the summer parties
and now you &apos;re the one throwing them ,
it seemed necessary .
and i was curious to see
how you would erase victoria from here .
thoroughly , it seems .
well , i like to forget as much of my past as possible .
my new mantra .
i regret letting daniel color my earlier opinion of you .
well , we &apos;ve both been burned by that match .
but i like to think he &apos;s getting his .
now that he &apos;s the son of the most hated man in america .
feel like i died and went to billy joel &apos;s house .
that &apos;s funny .
feel like i &apos;m in &quot; the twilight zone . &quot;
porter , i mean , you &apos;ve got to be
the most connected rookie that i &apos;ve ever known .
who &apos;s your in here ?
she &apos;s over there .
emily thorne .
yeah ?
you two got a little something going on ?
no , it &apos;s complicated .
yeah , uncomplicate it . she &apos;s hot .
her , too ?
come on , as your commanding officer ,
i order you to tell me your secret .
come on .
i &apos;ll show you the rest of the place .
game &apos;s in progress , guys . sorry .
charlotte , you &apos;re stripes , babe .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you guys want a bump ?
no , i think i &apos;ll pass .
miss , step back and put your hands on your head , please .
you can &apos;t be serious .
ben , ben , let me handle this .
look , given your history with her ,
i think you need to step back , too .
hey , you stay right there .
look , we can &apos;t do this to her .
she &apos;s not in a good place right now .
word of advice , porter , your duty is to protect .
you can &apos;t look out for people if you &apos;re looking the other way .
she &apos;s family .
fine .
but you get one pass with me .
one .
your buddy -- he &apos;s quite a jackass .
jack !
i hear you give her so much as aspirin ,
i &apos;m coming for you .
now ... leave peacefully ...
or i will arrest you .
both of you .
stop !
you can &apos;t take that from me ! that &apos;s my private property !
sorry , ma &apos;am . regulations .
she warned you .
they take it all .
no ! but this isn &apos;t fair !
all right .
back to your room .
hey , what &apos;s going on ? hey !
hey , who &apos;s in there ? !
open this door !
fire ! fire !
open the door !
thank you , olga .
go , victoria ! go ! go ! go !
wait for me !
i &apos;m sorry , poppet .
no ! victoria !
hey , slow down , po @-@ po porter .
i want an intro to that partner of y--
he left .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking bringing him here .
there was a situation with charlotte .
she came here with gideon .
they &apos;re dating ?
dating , doing blow --
whatever you want to call it , he &apos;s a bad influence .
yeah . he &apos;s a real enfant hair @-@ ible .
i considered working with him at one point ,
but his business model is two parts madoff , one part manson .
you know , i used to be the only person
charlotte could depend on .
at this rate , i &apos;ll be the -- the one booking her
by the end of the summer .
oh , i was just saying i want to poach your guest list
for my next fundraiser .
funny .
your brother said the same .
did he ?
no .
actually , i couldn &apos;t understand a word he was saying .
he was so high on yayo .
did you know that he brought charlotte ?
that &apos;s an interesting choice , if you ask me --
him going after daniel &apos;s sister .
what do you mean ?
uh , i &apos;m not sure you heard ,
but charlie did a stint in rehab
after an overdose .
she &apos;s not the most stable little pony .
i didn &apos;t realize .
just given her history , it makes me wonder
what gideon wants with her ,
as if squeezing her brother out of lemarchal wasn &apos;t enough .
daniel stepped down of his own volition .
did he ?
then i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve succumbed to idle gossip .
although , now i am curious what daniel would say
if you asked him about his night with the redhead .
i &apos;ve heard the whispers --
people wondering why i bought this house ,
how could i live here knowing what conrad grayson did .
well , call me an optimist ,
but i saw an opportunity to take something dark
and breathe new life into it -- make good happen ,
which all of you have helped me do today
with your generous donations .
so thank you .
hear , hear !
in that same spirit of starting anew ,
we invited the southampton yacht club
to christen this vessel , which launches from the gold coast
on friday for her maiden race .
i &apos;ll let her captain take it from here .
thanks , emily .
thanks , everyone , for being here .
happy memorial day .
what a way to celebrate , huh ?
my crew left me with the choice
of naming this lovely lady .
i knew i wanted to dedicate her to the love of my life ,
my anchor when i &apos;m adrift .
boys .
valerie ?
you son of a bitch . you named the boat after your mistress ?
no , that &apos;s not -- i didn &apos;t do that .
you &apos;re still screwing her , aren &apos;t you ? !
no !
after everything you put me through .
no , they painted the wrong name .
no , or your said the wrong name by accident .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time that happened .
jen , for god &apos;s sake , don &apos;t do this .
i only gave you an alibi to save myself the humiliation .
but now you can tell everyone for yourself ...
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
how you killed this poor girl &apos;s fiancè ?
because you were too busy piloting your whore
instead of your boat .
i am so sorry .
jen ! jen !
you crashed into that girl &apos;s car on purpose .
i came across her story , and i wanted to make it right .
it worked .
whoa , wait . what worked ?
manipulating retaliation for a girl
that did not even ask for it ?
you wouldn &apos;t understand . she will .
nancy .
nancy , please wait .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i had no idea that your fiancè --
he was the one who was killed last year .
you know when you hit my car ?
it was kind of the best thing
that had happened to me in a long time .
it felt good to get upset about something so trivial .
for so long , i couldn &apos;t feel anything
but hatred for that man out there .
i got sick of hating .
it is a useless , crippling emotion .
at least now he &apos;ll be charged .
then what ?
he &apos;s gonna hire fancy lawyers to fight it .
if there &apos;s a trial ,
i @-@ it would take months if not years , right ?
while i live th @-@ the worst day of my life over and over again .
even if they find him guilty , what &apos;s it all for ?
nothing can bring back the people we love .
nothing .
i &apos;m sorry . what were you expecting ?
a &quot; thank you &quot; ?
leave me alone .
i already made that mistake .
addicts cannot be trusted to be by themselves .
i &apos;m not an addict .
you are the very definition !
ems , i have been here since the beginning ,
but you shut me out
just like you &apos;re shutting me out now .
why ? because you &apos;re ashamed or -- or in denial ?
either way ...
em , you &apos;re scaring the hell out of me .
maybe it &apos;s time for an intervention
to force you to be who you really are .
what if i went out there and told everybody
that amanda clarke is alive and well ?
and everyone she loved is dead .
the graysons killed them all .
they left me nothing to go back to , nolan .
this is all i have left .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t let go of emily thorne .
ems ...
get out .
one peace offering deserves another ,
unless you &apos;re off negronis now .
i only said that so you would let me up .
why did you really step down from lemarchal ?
this again ? i already told you .
no , you didn &apos;t , actually .
you cited your family &apos;s tragedies ,
but family never stopped daniel grayson before .
and i know you just like you know
i &apos;ve never been satisfied with half @-@ truths .
so tell me about the redhead .
what did gideon say ?
i want to hear it from you .
okay .
remember that night i invited you over to the sassen hotel ?
and cancelled two minutes later ? yes .
i &apos;d been partying with this girl -- the redhead --
and i must &apos;ve passed out .
and when i woke up , i found her o.d &apos;d .
all i could think at the time
was what this would do to me ,
what this would do to my name , your company .
so i took care of it .
so you &quot; took care of it . &quot;
and , uh , what role did gideon play in this ?
no . what did he tell you ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter what he told me . and that --
oh , so he didn &apos;t tell you anything . unbelievable .
answer the question .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time
was that gideon was there when she died .
he took a photo of her and used it to blackmail me
and force me out of lemarchal .
now , i didn &apos;t tell you
because i wanted to protect you from my mistakes .
now , yes , what i did was indefensible .
yes , i should &apos;ve called the cops .
but i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know . i -- i panicked .
it seems that &apos;s what he was counting on .
as if he had planned it .
he got the room that night . he picked the girl .
part of me has always wondered
if he just got lucky she od &apos;d , or ...
you think my brother killed her .
then we have to do something .
not me . i &apos;m done with him .
well , are you done with your sister ?
because charlotte is with him right now .
hey , slow down . leave some for me .
i still can &apos;t believe jack ruined the rest .
jack is a gutless douchebag , like all cops ,
who hides behind his badge and his gun .
that &apos;s just it . he thinks he &apos;s untouchable now .
let me tell you something , sweetheart .
no one is untouchable .
hello ?
can we talk ?
well , that depends .
are we making up or ... breaking up ?
stop .
look , i &apos;m sorry that i wasn &apos;t honest with you today .
you asked me why i did what i did .
i empathized with nancy .
i wanted to protect her from feeling the pain that i felt .
from becoming like me .
she was never like me .
no one is .
you &apos;re a snowflake --
a unique , bloodthirsty snowflake .
and that &apos;s just it , isn &apos;t it ?
like you said , i &apos;m an addict .
that thirst has become a part of me .
i don &apos;t know who i am without it .
maybe i don &apos;t want to .
let me call you back .
oh , you didn &apos;t invite me to your party .
how did you get out , victoria ?
with a little help from my friends .
nothing bonds people like being imprisoned together --
something i know you &apos;re familiar with , given your time in juvie .
am i right , amanda ?
what do you want ?
arriving here tonight ,
i think i know how you must &apos;ve felt
when you first returned to the hamptons .
so much hatred in your heart for me
and what you thought i &apos;d done .
what you did .
if you &apos;d only come clean then ,
you could &apos;ve known the truth .
you could &apos;ve reunited with your sister
and prevented her so much pain ,
but instead , you chose revenge .
now it &apos;s my turn .
