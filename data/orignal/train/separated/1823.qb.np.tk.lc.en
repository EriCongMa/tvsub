according to elizabeth kubler ross
when we are dying or have suffered a catastrophic loss
we all move through five or distinct stages of grief
we go into denial
because the loss is so unthinkable .
we can &apos;t imagine it &apos;s true .
we become angry with everyone ,
angry with survivors , angry with ourselves .
then we bargain .
damn it , o &apos;malley.come on . live . just live .
i.c.p. &apos; s 30.push 70 of mannitol and start bagging .
he &apos;s hemorrhaging into his brain stem
we beg , we plead
we offer everything we have .
we offer up our souls .
in exchange for just one more day .
stevens , can you hear me ?
look at me , stevens .
when the bargining has failed and the angry is too hard to maintain .
we &apos;re falling into depression , despair until finally
we have to accept that we have done everything we can .
we let go
we let go and move into acceptance .
anybody know if he is a donor ?
哀悼
move , she wants it out , can &apos;t we take out ?
she &apos;s breathing out of the vent
all right , let &apos;s pull out the tube
doctor bailey ,
his icp came in through the roof .
we did everything . everything .
this organ is viable for now but it won &apos;t be long
until he &apos;s acidotic and hypothermic
is he a donor ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
i called his mother , she &apos;s on her way .
let &apos;s close him up and send him to the icu unit
in case she wants to see him .
who &apos;s george ?
what ?
the john doe , the guy who threw me out of the way of the bus ,
the guy who saved my life .
everyone is crying , and they keep saying john doe is george , who &apos;s george ?
you can &apos;t tell her .
alex
she coded in my arms , i &apos;d know where she died .
just ... i &apos;ll tell her .
i &apos;ll tell her when she gets stronger .
alex
you ok ?
i ... i dreamed ...
he was in his uniform
what ?
george is going to die in the army if we don &apos;t stop him .
hand me my phone . i need my phone .
who said that was george ?
why do we think that &apos;s george ?
meredith . so ...
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s not geroge .
look , at his feet , at how tall he is ,
that &apos;s not george .
he wrote in my hand .
what did he do ?
what does that
no , he grabbed my hand and he squeezed it ,
and he wrote with his finger .
he wrote with his finger ?
you know , in my hand. he wrote &quot; 007 . &quot;
well , give ...
okay , what did i write ?
joe ?
n @-@ no ! no , i did not write &quot; joe . &quot;
are--are you serious ?
grey , do you mean this may not be o &apos;malley ?
this is funny .
did anyone try and call o &apos;malley ?
can we get him on the phone ?
i &apos;m telling you , he squeezed my hand .
just sh @-@ shut it .
you don &apos;t get to talk anymore .
you don &apos;t get to talk ever again .
i could &apos;ve sworn it was george .
i got voice mail .
he &apos;s not answering .
he has a freckle on his right hand .
it &apos;s shaped like texas . i used to tease him about it .
i &apos;ll check .
you people , answer your pagers .
george o &apos;malley jumped in front of a bus today .
he knew what he was doing , and he did it anyway ,
and he did it to save a life .
so i &apos;m not gonna allow you doctors to stand here .
there are lives on the line .
there are lives we can save .
so if george o &apos;malley can jump in front of a bus ,
we can answer our damn pages .
so let &apos;s go .
damn it .
damn it , o &apos;malley .
now how long ago did the pain start ?
i don &apos;t know . a @-@ a few weeks ?
growing pains . i took him to see our doctor .
he &apos;s a bad doctor .
he &apos;s--he stands there texting while i &apos;m talking to him .
he diagnosed andy with growing pains .
but , you know , i grew up ,
and growing pains did not
cause me to fall down
mom , you &apos;re being a little dramatic .
your pain is dramatic to me .
andy. your mom &apos;s right .
it &apos;s a good thing that you came .
okay , thanks , because it does hurt .
everything hurts , all the time .
okay . well , i &apos;m gonna give you a quick exam ,
and you &apos;re gonna let me know if the pain gets worse , okay ?
i know . i &apos;ll be all right .
this doesn &apos;t feel real .
does this feel real to you ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
oh , crap .
i don &apos;t want ... i can &apos;t--
mnh @-@ mnh . don &apos;t walk away now . come on .
don &apos;t walk ... mm .
mrs. o &apos;malley ... i &apos;m so sorry .
you were his wife .
in god &apos;s eyes , you &apos;re still his wife .
you should decide about his organs .
you should decide .
but , um
i can &apos;t do it , callie .
i can &apos;t do it . you understand ?
ronnie and--and jerry ,
they &apos;re off on some fishing expedition in alaska ,
and they &apos;re gonna come home
and i have to tell them that georgie ...
that &apos;s all i can do . that &apos;s all i can ...
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i can &apos;t ... even see him like this . i can &apos;t .
you need to do this for me .
can you do this for me ?
speed boat accident . 19 @-@ year @-@ old female .
lost vitals twice , but b.p. &apos; s holding in the low 80s .
both arms amputated at the scene ,
and the right leg &apos;s hanging on by a thread .
did you recover either of the arms ?
no , they &apos;re probably at the bottom of puget sound .
she was thrown from the boat , got pulled into the propeller .
she needs more access. she &apos;s bleeding out .
let &apos;s get a central line in her. let &apos;s go. go .
draw trauma labs , uh , type and cross her
and get as much o @-@ neg as possible .
wait ! i found them . i found them .
her arms !
they were on the boat with her .
i found them in the water. you have to take them .
they were just floating in the water .
you--you can sew them back on , right ?
we &apos;ll do everything we can .
oh , my god , jojo. that was so gross .
jasmine , you just saved her life .
you think ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i just heard .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
go home. you need to go home .
you need to cry and scream and--
when my brother died
i @-@ i ate doughnuts .
i ate a lot of doughnuts , and that helped some but ...
god , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
his mom wants me to decide about his organs .
he lost his wallet in the accident .
they don &apos;t know if he &apos;s a donor ,
and now his mom wants me to decide
and i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t tell her no
but i can &apos;t decide .
i mean , we were only married for a few months .
okay , but ... during those months ,
you were the most important person in george &apos;s life .
no .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
i ... i &apos;m sorry .
okay , so let &apos;s take a look at the x @-@ rays .
do i need to take my son to another hospital ?
what ?
that doctor &apos;s hands are shaking
as he tries to stick my son with a needle ,
and those nurses are crying .
you and your friend-- what the hell is going on here ?
there was an accident
and one of our people died .
andy is my person .
he &apos;s my only person .
and ... something is wrong with him .
so what i &apos;m asking you is ,
do i need to take him somewhere else ?
no .
no .
i &apos;ll make andy my person , okay ?
i &apos;ll make andy my person , too .
i didn &apos;t tell her , okay ?
karev
look , we just ignored her d.n.r.
her kidneys quit and she coded .
she was freaking intubated .
she &apos;s not strong enough .
what &apos;s her b.u.n. ?
15 .
and her creatinine ?
1.5 .
she &apos;s strong enough .
she &apos;s strong enough , and you have to tell her .
why ? it can wait .
no , it can &apos;t .
it can &apos;t wait because george &apos;s organs
are not gonna be viable for long .
if they want to use &apos; em , they have to do it soon ,
and i have to decide if they get to use &apos; em ,
and i need izzie to help me ,
because she &apos;s the one who should decide .
she &apos;s who should decide .
so that &apos;s one reason and ... and the other reason is , karev ,
if you let them unplug george
without giving her a chance to say good @-@ bye ...
i mean it , she will never forgive you .
you have to tell her .
her pressure keeps dropping .
let &apos;s throw in an i.o. and put the blood in the rapid infuser .
these are pretty clean amputations .
we can reattach these arms .
yay ! i found &apos; em , you know ?
i &apos;m looking at omentum .
let &apos;s get her to an o.r. now .
does your friend have any allergies ,
medical conditions ?
is she on any medication ?
she &apos;s not our friend .
jasmine ! we barely know her .
we met her on the plane from sydney .
we &apos;re backpacking , seeing the states .
so we hardly know her .
we &apos;re just traveling mates .
she &apos;s really nice , though .
all right , let &apos;s move .
a name. uh , can you give me that ?
clara ... ferguson , i think. clara ferguson .
clara , hang in there. stay with me .
she lives with her mum in london. mm @-@ hmm .
i have her backpack in my car .
okay , get it .
should we stay ? yes , uh ,
in the waiting room . i &apos;ll update you when i can .
dr. shepherd .
mr. jennings. it &apos;s good to see you .
it &apos;s derek , right ?
may i call you derek ?
of course .
i understand you lost a resident .
that &apos;s sad . i &apos;m sorry .
but the hospital board is meeting soon , and , derek ,
i need to know
if you &apos;d like to be the next chief of surgery
at seattle grace .
george .
it &apos;s me .
you know , i pretty much died not too long ago .
so i need you to call me back .
please .
i know .
i played the cancer card .
i &apos;m gross. whatever .
i need to tell you something ,
and i need you to not panic .
i need you to keep breathing .
i need you to stay alive , &apos; cause ...
i swear to god , i need you to stay alive .
all right ?
okay .
o &apos;malley ...
he got in an accident .
he &apos;s brain dead .
i &apos;m sorry. what ?
what about his heart ?
okay .
his eyes ?
i know .
don &apos;t want to imagine him without his eyes .
george would give everything .
his skin , his eyes--
he would give everything .
i have a kid in there--
15 years old , previously healthy--
has back pain bad enough to cause vomiting .
can you talk it through with me ?
because i can &apos;t figure out what it is ,
and i think best out loud .
did you not hear about george o &apos;malley ?
i did .
it &apos;s incredibly sad .
i cannot talk to you right now .
i cannot work right now .
dr. bailey ...
i hear that .
and i don &apos;t mean to be insensitive .
but this kid ? this kid &apos;s still alive .
and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with him .
not a clue .
so ... i need you to work .
i need you to talk through
this living patient with me , bailey .
please .
how &apos;s his neuro exam ?
normal .
could it be ... a compression fracture ?
plain films and c.t. are negative .
any congenital problems ?
none reported .
need to go home ?
no .
did you eat ?
no .
can you eat ?
no .
did you cry ?
no .
maybe if you cried , you &apos;d feel better .
i--you just--just , uh , you being here is ...
and don &apos;t say anything , just be here ,
that--that--that helps .
how are you ?
meredith. we need you .
okay. excuse me .
amanda .
you have to go. we need the room .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
you , too , huh ? growing pains .
you &apos;re saying this is growing p--
no , no , no. not just growing pains .
he has a mild case of scoliosis , which ,
combined with a growth spurt , could account for the pain
and the clumsiness on the soccer field .
so we &apos;ll see if it settles in a couple of weeks ,
and if not , then you &apos;ll come back in for more tests .
why don &apos;t you just run them now ?
because the next set of tests involve things
like sticking large needles into andy &apos;s spine .
all right , then. heading home .
you &apos;re sure about this ?
no .
but i &apos;m gonna write a prescription
for muscle relaxants ,
and you know that i &apos;m here if you need me ,
which i really hope that you won &apos;t .
did torres decide about o &apos;malley ?
about his organs ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m gonna see where they are .
uh , chief .
look , i ...
i know this is the worst possible moment ,
but ...
we need to talk .
the board is planning a coup .
they &apos;re saying that you dropped the ball ,
that our ranking isn &apos;t coming up .
they want to oust you .
they &apos;re asking me to support it .
they &apos;re asking me to step up , to take the job .
take my job ?
i told them i &apos;d think about it .
i bought you some time . but you need a plan .
torres has made a decision .
were you here to give an update on the boating victim ?
uh , yeah. where are
they left. her friends left .
they said that they had a plane to catch and something
about a concert in vegas that they didn &apos;t want to miss .
they left her pack for you. she &apos;s got dozens of surgeries ahead of her ,
if she survives this one. she needs a support system .
okay , until we find her family , you &apos;re it. keep that .
uh , w--i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry. you want me--
you--you &apos;re ordering me to what , be her friend ?
she &apos;s gonna wake up in a lot of pain
missing one of her legs
and unable to use either of her arms ,
so yes , i am ordering you to be her friend ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m sure as hell not gonna do it .
i &apos;m heading back to surgery .
patient is george o &apos;malley , 29 .
procedure is organ recovery for donation .
i will call on the receiving surgeons .
kidneys .
st. luke &apos;s children &apos;s. boise .
who is it for ?
sorry ?
who are his kidneys for ?
i gave all that to the nurse .
i would like you to tell me .
molly kemper ...
8 years old , hypoplastic kidneys .
thank you .
lungs ?
lungs and heart are going to portland medical center .
terry class , age 22 .
cystic fibrosis .
you are evil. you are the devil .
i am . i admit it .
cristina , you know the rules .
oh , the rules are stupid .
mm. so you &apos;re saying my shrink &apos;s stupid ? hmm ?
i &apos;m saying she &apos;s a prude .
she &apos;s prudey and--and misguided. mm @-@ hmm .
she wants us to get to know each other .
she wants me to keep getting to know myself .
she does not want me ... burying myself in you .
and if we start to have sex ...
i &apos;ll bury myself in you .
oh , now who &apos;s evil ?
it &apos;s not gonna be too much longer .
you want me to quit therapy ? hmm ?
no !
mm @-@ hmm. crap .
all right. we have to go to o &apos;malley &apos;s funeral anyway .
no , i hate funerals. let &apos;s skip it .
uh , we can , uh , push up ceviche &apos;s debridement .
that &apos;s a good excuse .
ceviche ?
chopped up fish. propeller accident .
ceviche. it &apos;s funny .
right. it &apos;s sick .
that &apos;s what makes it funny .
we are going to the funeral. come on .
&quot; and then all these unicycle boys with wings &quot;
carried us on a platform like
we were cleopatra or something .
hilarious . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe they went to burning man. hags .
they &apos;d never even heard of burning man .
i hate them .
i hate them .
clara ...
forget them .
okay ? they &apos;re morons .
they &apos;re just ... think about today .
okay , the fact that today , you &apos;re gonna get
what we believe is your final debridement ,
and then after that , we &apos;re gonna get
the physical therapist in here to get your arm moving .
so i am gonna save this piece for you to do .
thanks .
now i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
no. don &apos;t you want to call your mom ...
no .
before your next surgery ?
no. not yet .
but we could write her another e @-@ mail .
will it make you late for your funeral ?
no , no .
hi , mum .
i hope you &apos;re well .
aside from the heat and the smell ,
burning man was amazing .
there is an appointed time for everything ,
and a time for every affair under the heavens ...
a time to be born and a time to die ,
a time to plant
and a time to uproot the plant ,
a time to kill and a time to heal ...
a time to tear down and a time to build ...
a time to weep ...
are you okay ?
you want the wheelchair ?
and a time to laugh ,
a time to mourn and a time to dance ,
a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together ,
a time to embrace
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re laughing ?
she &apos;s laughing .
george--george is dead. he &apos;s dead .
they &apos;re about to put him in the ground ,
and the priest is doing classic rock lyrics .
and that girl ,
that redhead is crying harder than his mother ,
and she never even met him .
it &apos;s just ...
you are far more twisted than i ever realized .
and you got married
on a post @-@ it .
i got married on a post @-@ it . i did . i did .
you guys got married for real ?
i know !
and i got cancer. what ?
dude , o @-@ o &apos;malley got hit by a bus .
oh , my god .
she never stops crying .
not now. please not now .
it &apos;s been a week . you &apos;ve been avoiding me .
not now .
i am buying you time , you know ? i am buying you time .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve given .
you have no idea what i have sacrificed .
for every miscalculation you think you see ,
there have been a hundred things
that i have gotten right ,
and no one knows .
look , i &apos;m on your side , okay ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not the board . i &apos;m not jennings .
well , then back off , then .
just back off and ...
you give me time to think .
let me have a minute to ...
o &apos;malley was my intern .
and i am trying to just take a minute .
so , derek , please ...
back off .
you want a ride home ?
i was gonna clean out his locker ,
give his stuff to his mom ,
but ... i was a bad friend
to george .
i was about as good a friend to him
as clara &apos;s friends ,
who keep sending postcards
from the trip that she &apos;ll never get to take .
i just ... i ... i abandoned him completely .
i @-@ i @-@ i just ... moved out
and--and stopped talking to him and ... why ?
because--
because he didn &apos;t think i was as hot
as i thought he was
or be @-@ because he--
he didn &apos;t-- he didn &apos;t love me back ?
this ... may be bad timing ,
but i gotta ask .
what did that guy have ?
i mean , he wasn &apos;t much to look at .
but you and stevens
and torres ?
tell the truth .
was he ... you know ...
hung ?
that &apos;s--
i know . i said bad timing . i--
but seriously ,
he was kind of a dorky little dude .
stop . stop talking .
sorry . sorry .
he ... he died .
i ...
george died .
yeah .
okay , any pain here ?
now take a deep breath .
any dizziness when you stood up take a deep breath ?
no .
okay .
you are going home .
you are gonna come back in 12 days
for another round of i.l.-2,
and then you have your pet @-@ scan two weeks after that .
but there &apos;s no need for you to keep living in this bed .
you should take it easy .
you &apos;re still a cancer patient ,
but you &apos;re no longer a surgical patient .
thank you , dr. bailey .
i don &apos;t know how to ...
thank you .
uh , don &apos;t forget to sign the discharge papers before you leave .
andy ?
he &apos;s got serious pain in his inguinal area
and down his legs and in his lower back .
he &apos;s got a temp of 101,
and his mom says he &apos;s been throwing up all night .
please don &apos;t tell me this is growing pains ,
dr. robbins .
i can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s okay .
i can &apos;t move it at all .
it &apos;s only been three days since your last surgery .
the swelling will come down . we &apos;ll just keep trying .
you &apos;re doing great .
right . great .
so ... where did we leave off ,
at the grand canyon ?
yeah .
big , gorgeous hole in the ground .
okay , uh , miss you , mum .
uh , wish you could see it .
clara , sorry. um ...
you are doing great ,
but you got a long road here .
and believe me , your mom ,
she &apos;s gonna want to know .
and she &apos;s gonna want to help .
she made me from scratch .
that &apos;s what she always says .
like ... when i wanted to go skydiving , you know ?
&quot; don &apos;t jump out of a plane , clara .
i made that body from scratch . &quot;
or when i sprained my ankle ...
&quot; be more careful , darling .
i made that ankle from scratch . &quot;
miss you , mum .
i &apos;m doing great .
love you . clara .
come in .
oh , dr. torres .
chief , i was just , um ...
i was just wondering .
i , um , haven &apos;t heard anything
about my application for attending , so ...
well , dr. torres ,
dr. chang &apos;s 401 took a hit ,
and he &apos;s putting off retirement for another year or two .
so ... so wait .
you &apos;re not giving me the job ?
there is no job , not this year .
i &apos;m sorry . i assumed you &apos;d heard .
okay , um , dr. chang is basically a figurehead .
you &apos;re clear on that , right ?
when people want the best , they page me .
i have basically been running dr. chang &apos;s department all year .
dr. chang has an impeccable record .
he is a dinosaur !
and so am i !
you &apos;re ...
this is c--
you &apos;re gonna regret this .
dr.torres ...
no
no , no . i am just ...
no . i am excellent .
i am excellent ,
and any other hospital would be thrilled to have me .
i &apos;m flattered for the offer , larry ,
and i &apos;m seriously considering it , but it &apos;s--
it &apos;s complicated , and i need a little more time .
i can &apos;t give you more time , derek .
i can give you more money , better benefits
and a whole lot of press-- that &apos;s what i can give you .
but i can &apos;t give you much more time .
yes , i am .
i &apos;m a superstar ... a superstar with a scalpel .
torres
no ! don &apos;t say my name . do not .
i am too big a star for you to say my name .
i build arms out of nothing , and legs , like god .
and when i win the harper avery and every other prize there is ,
you will rue this day , chief webber .
that &apos;s right . i said &quot; rue . &quot;
tight ship you &apos;re running here , webber .
tight ship
amanda .
hi .
hi. what are you doing here ?
uh , i ... can &apos;t sleep .
i can &apos;t ... fall asleep
&apos;cause i see his face all the time .
i see him at the bus stop ...
you know , sweet , smiling , and then ...
and then i see the way that he ended up ,
so that even his best friends can &apos;t recognize him ,
and i can &apos;t sleep .
can you ... can you sleep ?
i , um ... am gonna write you a prescription
for an antianxiety medication .
and i want you to take it ,
because this sleep deprivation thing can be quite harmful .
dr. robbins .
chief .
did you order an emergent 3 @-@ d m.r.i. for this patient ?
okay , you &apos;re mad . i see that .
but with the patient &apos;s mother &apos;s insurance ,
it could take weeks to get an m.r.i.
and a specialty pain referral ...
so you expect the hospital to pay for this with whose money ?
oh , well , sir , i only thought that
i don &apos;t want to hear it , dr. robbins .
now discharge your patient , refer him back to his physician ,
and do it now .
dr. karev , change of plans .
open up !
open the door , torres .
open the door or i &apos;ll keep knocking
and potentially damage my multimillion @-@ dollar hands .
my ex @-@ husband died .
he died . he actually got hit by a bus .
george got hit by a bus .
and now--now i have to get a new job ,
and--and i &apos;m never gonna see my friends anymore .
and arizona keeps bringing me doughnuts .
this place for sale ? it &apos;s nice .
what ?
oh , nothing , nothing . shh .
oh , my god !
derek !
oh ! hey ! hi !
dude , get a room .
on the stairs ? doesn &apos;t that hurt ?
leave us alone . we &apos;re newlyweds !
a post @-@ it wedding does not make you newlyweds .
you know what ? you &apos;re newlyweds , too .
you need your own space .
hey , dude , what are these ?
the keys to my trailer-- your new home .
enjoy .
dr. hunt ?
yes .
i &apos;m louise o &apos;malley . george &apos;s mother .
of course , of course . i &apos;m sorry. i @-@ i didn &apos;t ...
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m ... well , i hope you don &apos;t mind me coming here to see you .
i know you surgeons are--are very busy people .
my georgie was always saying ...
it &apos;s no problem. it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m ... having trouble .
i &apos;m having trouble ...
i ...
and i @-@ i @-@ i think it &apos;s because
i--i &apos;m having trouble understanding .
uh , there &apos;s a piece of the puzzle missing .
i do better when i understand things , how things happen .
and george ...
my george ...
the boy i knew , the boy i raised , my boy
would never have joined the army .
so i &apos;m trying to understand .
i &apos;m trying to understand that piece of it .
i &apos;m trying to understand why georgie wasn &apos;t at work that day ,
why he was on his way to my house
to tell me he &apos;d joined the army in wartime .
i don &apos;t understand .
and dr. webber said i should talk to you .
mrs. o &apos;malley , i didn &apos;t know him like you knew him .
i didn &apos;t know him long ,
but he had tremendous potential as a trauma surgeon .
he ... he was very fast on his feet ,
and he could think and act simultaneously under intense pressure .
he had tremendous potential .
and ...
you know , he was impatient .
he wanted to become better faster .
he wanted to save more lives .
he was good .
and he was thoughtful and generous .
and i think in the end , i think ...
i think he was heroic and noble .
and i liked him very much .
and i think he gave you good reason
to be very , very proud .
hey . i &apos;m , uh , headed out .
i just wanted to say goodnight. night .
clara , you just moved-- you moved your fingers .
like--like you waved. you waved good @-@ bye .
this is huge .
that &apos;s huge ?
that i waved ?
that i waved a finger ?
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s my life from now on ?
that &apos;s the best i have to hope for ?
clara ...
do you see that woman out there
talking to dr. hunt ?
we--we buried her son this week .
he had an accident , like you .
he--he wasn &apos;t even as bad off as you were ,
and he didn &apos;t make it .
clara , i know that it doesn &apos;t feel like it ,
but it is a miracle that you lived .
it is a miracle .
so you should call your mom .
she would want to know the truth .
you stupid little bitch .
you really don &apos;t get it , do you ?
you shoulda let me die .
you had no business .
i &apos;ve got one working hand . i may never walk again .
do you think you &apos;re god ?
you had no business .
your friend is better off .
his mum is better off .
do you think this is a miracle ?
who wants to live like this ?
just let me die .
just let me die ! please just let me die .
clara , clara , you need to stop . clara , you need ...
just let me die ! get off me .
clara ... i need some help in here !
let me die . let me die .
stop . clara , stop . you have to stop moving .
get off me
in medical school , we have a hundred classes
that teach us how to fight off death ...
and not one lesson in how to go on living .
the dictionary defines grief as ,
&quot; keen mental suffering or distress
over affliction or loss .
sharp sorrow .
painful regret . &quot;
as surgeons , as scientists ,
we &apos;re taught to learn from and rely on books ,
on definitions ,
on definitives .
but in life ... strict definitions rarely apply .
in life ...
grief can look like a lot of things
that bear little resemblance to sharp sorrow .
&quot; you &apos;re not missing much . new york smells like pee . &quot;
god , i hate them .
more pain ?
your c.t. results should be back soon .
i &apos;m fine .
you should go home tonight .
you can call off the 24 @-@ hour suicide watch , you know ?
honestly , i &apos;m better now .
i am .
do you know what i think ?
i think you &apos;re using me
to avoid moving in with your boyfriend .
am not .
i &apos;ll make you a deal ... you move in with your boyfriend ,
and i &apos;ll let you call my mum .
oh , mean .
chicken .
okay , uh , clara , the c.t. shows
you have an infection in your small bowel
and your colon is inflamed .
it &apos;s most likely something you picked up in the water .
but it seems to have formed an abscess ,
which means you need surgery right away .
no .
uh , if we don &apos;t go ...
no .
no more surgery . i &apos;m not being cut open again .
okay , uh ... no .
you just take a minute . take a few minutes .
and i &apos;ll come back , and we &apos;ll discuss it .
um , start her on pre @-@ op antibiotics
and book an o.r.
what are the options ?
can you give me drugs ? can you ..
no , you need surgery , but it &apos;s a simple procedure .
and if it all goes as planned , you sh ...
well , my boat ride didn &apos;t exactly go as planned .
so tell me , worst case .
well , uh , worst case is ...
that we &apos;d have to take out a part of your colon
and give you a colostomy bag ...
colostomy bag ? a pooh bag outside your body ?
my granddad had one of those . it was ...
no , but it ... it &apos;s a small , small possibility .
no . no pooh bag . no surgery . no .
the infection will kill you , clara .
no .
no more surgery .
no .
告别
we tried pain meds and treated him for pyelonephritis .
but it looks like it could be something more serious ,
so we did a c.m.g.
you did a c.m.g. for a u.t.i. ?
why would you even look for something ...
because we were out of ideas .
the c.m.g. was negative .
so we went back to a possible neurological cause .
so if we could get a better look ,
if you could give us permission to get a 3 @-@ d m.r.i. ,
we could maybe , just possibly ...
chief , this kid &apos;s been in the e.r.four times
in the last three weeks because the pain meds aren &apos;t working .
why can &apos;t we just ...
$ 5,000 , karev .
that &apos;s how much either you or dr. robbins
would have to put up to cover that scan .
otherwise , you could come with me
to my board meeting this afternoon
and explain why you &apos;re running this hospital
like it &apos;s a charity .
dude , are you crying ?
i have authority issues .
walk away , karev .
where do you get off killing my patients , yang ?
killing your ...
when you take it upon yourself
to talk that girl out of a lifesaving surgery ,
you &apos;re killing her .
i didn &apos;t talk her ...
she had questions about the surgery .
you left the room .
no , i left the room
to give a very fragile , very distraught patient
time and space to accept what &apos;s being asked of her .
then and only then would i have discussed
the possible risks with , i &apos;m certain ,
more tact and sensitivity than you have ever displayed
in all the time that i &apos;ve known you .
she asked ...
no . i don &apos;t care what she ahe asked you .
and if she asks you anything else , your only answer will be ,
&quot; let me ask my attending . &quot;
these are good . do they sell these in the cafeteria ?
no .
no , those are the cancer pops .
why do cancer people get all the fun ?
how do you feel , izzie ?
i &apos;m not looking forward
to the hurling that &apos;s about to happen , but i feel okay .
i feel good .
bailey &apos;s on some sort of rampage .
i think it &apos;s post @-@ o &apos;malley stress disorder .
she &apos;s not dealing with her grief .
you sound like owen &apos;s shrink .
owen &apos;s shrink ...
is withholding sex , so she is grumpy and inappropriate .
is derek doing that , too , withholding sex ?
why would derek withhold sex ?
alex is withholding ... everything .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s afraid , but i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s afraid of .
he &apos;s afraid of the cancer sex .
cristina !
he doesn &apos;t want to end up with a cancer pop .
cristina !
just shut the hell up .
i &apos;m not contagious , cristina .
i know that . i would totally have sex with you .
really ? nothing ?
no .
you don &apos;t even want a drawer ?
no .
how about a toothbrush , change of panties ?
no .
damn . i like your panties .
i am trying to focus .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m becoming a resident today .
i need to focus .
i &apos;m right across the street from the hospital .
if you crash here sometimes , you &apos;ll get a jump
on a lot of surgeries .
okay , okay . which one ?
it &apos;s my first day at mercy west
and i want to look nice .
you know , serious , talented , hard @-@ core ,
not someone you push around .
nice but hot ...
like me .
that one .
really ? i thought this one .
mnh @-@ mnh . too hot . better for a date . that one .
okay . here . can you ... thanks .
okay .
okay . less hot ?
less hot .
okay . okay , okay . good . thanks . wish me luck .
or not luck , &apos; cause i &apos;m all talented and hard @-@ core .
you &apos;re an attending , torres . go kick some ass .
so , um ...
did you forget to mention that your hot ,
hard @-@ core ex @-@ sex @-@ friend lives right across the hall ?
did i ?
yeah. yeah , you did .
and it is only under my tenure as chief
that seattle grace has grown into one of the most renowned ,
lauded and sought @-@ after surgical centers in the country .
replacing me ...
no. no , no .
disrupting that process would be an epic mistake .
it is for that reason that i stand before you today
and say with the utmost confidence
that there is no one who understands
and cares more about seattle grace than ...
than me .
look , this is ridiculous . i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s a sprained ankle ,
and--and i have a meeting i have to get to .
look , i said i &apos;m fine .
chief ?
torres . thank god .
you were in a car accident ?
oh , it was minor . i ran a red light .
i was distracted . i am fine .
can we make this quick ? i have a meeting with the board .
hmm. okay . let &apos;s see .
ooh . ooh , i don &apos;t know , sir .
this lac looks pretty deep .
you &apos;ll definitely need stitches .
and the ankle--oh , yikes .
yeah . you could need surgery .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s a sprain , torres .
you two know each other ?
yeah . dr. webber and i go way back , huh ?
we worked together for , what was it , five , six years ?
yeah . you know , i hate to say it ,
but you &apos;re gonna have to have that lac repaired .
and this being a teaching hospital ,
not to mention dr. mckee &apos;s first day ,
i have to let him work you up .
so you know how to do sutures , right , dr. mckee ?
damn straight .
great . good seeing you , chief .
look , doc--d
she &apos;s , uh ,
she &apos;s just kidding about this being my first day .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s my eighth .
what kind of sutures are you using ?
uh , 3 @-@ 0 nylon ?
no , no , no . use dermabond .
it takes less time and it heals quicker .
yeah , i know , but , like , budget cuts , you know ?
you like working in this place , doctor , um , mckee ?
i mean , you think it &apos;s a strong program ?
yeah , it rocks .
like , day eight , and i &apos;m doing unsupervised procedures ?
not too shabby .
mm @-@ hmm . not too shabby .
uh , he trained at northwestern and then at harvard .
uh , he grew up like five miles away from here .
um , not rich , not poor .
comfortable and well @-@ loved by his parents ,
but , um , uh , itching to do something more with his life ,
which is when he enlisted , at the age of--
cristina , this is not a book report .
i &apos;m trying to explain to dr. wyatt
that i know things about you .
cristina
wait , wait , wait . he knows things about me , too ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna say , &apos; cause we talk .
i mean , we talk all the time . honey ?
&quot; honey &quot; ?
cristina , let me be clear .
it &apos;s not just that i want the two of you
to get to know each other ,
it &apos;s that i want owen to feel comfortable with you .
oh , he is comfortable with me .
it &apos;s fine .
you can talk to her . it &apos;s fine .
okay .
cristina , um , he talks to you ,
he &apos;s comfortable with you .
does he talk to you about his trauma ?
does owen talk to you about the war ?
does he talk to you about the incident between you two
the choking ?
owen &apos;s post @-@ traumatic stress is fed ...
by his avoidance of talking about anything in the war .
in order to improve , to heal ,
he &apos;s going to have to start talking about it ,
to you and to me .
and my concern is ,
if you get lost in the lust of it all ,
he won &apos;t have to make a start .
he won &apos;t have any reason to .
he &apos;ll feel that he has everything he needs
until he doesn &apos;t .
so ... i &apos;m asking you
to wait .
finished .
read it back to me .
&quot; hi , mom . please prepare yourself ,
&quot; because this is gonna be difficult to read .
i &apos;ve been in an accident . &quot;
that &apos;s not what i said .
&quot; i &apos;ve suffered terrible injuries and 17 surgeries .
you can &apos;t send that to her .
&quot; currently , i &apos;m suffering from an abdominal infection ,
&quot; which i &apos;ve refused to treat , so i &apos;m gonna die soon .
&quot; please come quickly , mom ,
&quot; and if i &apos;m gone before you get here ,
&quot; i just wanted to tell you how much i love you &quot;
stop it .
&quot; and to thank you for making me from scratch . &quot;
bitch . you &apos;re a bitch .
i can hit the call button and i can have the nurses
in here to take you into surgery ,
or i can hit &quot; send &quot; -- that &apos;s the deal .
i will sue you .
i will sue you and this hospital .
no , you won &apos;t . you &apos;ll be dead .
please . please .
hello . the nurses said you called for me ?
this is andy .
andy michaelson .
i &apos;m sorry . have i treated you before ?
dr. arizona robbins referred us . oh .
oh , andy . oh , you &apos;re the--
you &apos;re the kid with the
with the thing no one can diagnose .
yeah , that &apos;s us .
okay , so dr. robbins sent you here to mercy west because ...
these are copies
of andy &apos;s paperwork from seattle grace .
we don &apos;t sleep anymore .
we basically just go to the hospital , you know ?
and i don &apos;t know what else to do ,
&apos;cause i feel like a terrible mother .
mom
i feel like a terrible mother because i &apos;m supposed to ...
i &apos;m supposed to do something , and i can &apos;t .
mom .
you know , i didn &apos;t go to medical school .
i majored in freaking history .
y @-@ you &apos;re the doctors , you know ? you &apos;re the doctors .
and basically , all we &apos;ve been doing up to this point ,
any of us , all we &apos;ve been doing
is getting my kid strung out on these pain meds .
mom , stop .
i can &apos;t , andy . i can &apos;t stop .
we don &apos;t sleep .
he can &apos;t sleep .
we can &apos;t sleep .
and i &apos;m scared .
and dr. robbins said that what she needs for you to give us
is a 3 @-@ d m.r.i. of his spine .
and she said you wouldn &apos;t want to
because there &apos;s no indication or whatever ,
but she says that &apos;s what he needs .
please .
i can &apos;t be this useless .
and you know what ? neither can you .
please .
that &apos;s a lot of necrotic small bowel .
can you save any of it ?
yesterday i could have .
yesterday this would &apos;ve been a simple drainage .
but that was before dr. yang threatened my patient
with a colostomy
that thankfully will not be necessary ,
because it did not actually involve the colon .
how can i help ?
oh , you &apos;ve done enough .
she asked me a question . i was right to answer it .
i did my job .
a patient asked me to disclose the risks of a surgical procedure ,
and i am required by law and my oath to do so .
if you know a way to sugarcoat a colostomy bag ,
i would like to hear it .
if you know a more respectful way
to speak to an attending surgeon ,
i &apos;d like to hear that .
until you do , you don &apos;t talk to me .
you &apos;re off my service .
okay , okay , seriously ?
what is your problem ? !
more suits ?
it &apos;s freaking people out .
mm. there &apos;s talk of downsizing ,
corporate takeovers ,
rumors that webber &apos;s jumping ship .
you &apos;ve got the chief &apos;s ear. what &apos;s he got planned ?
he &apos;s retiring .
they &apos;re making me chief .
no .
really ?
yeah .
really ?
yeah .
i mean , the chief never said anything to me .
i would &apos;ve fought you hard for that .
well , i guess if that &apos;s what he wants ...
i guess , uh , congratulations are in order .
wait , that was ...
you &apos;re messing with me ?
it &apos;s just too easy .
oh. you got a mean streak , you know that ?
yeah .
mean .
seriously , what &apos;s going on ?
i have no idea .
oh , i have wine ... white and red .
and i have cigarettes , which is awful , i know .
but i only smoke &apos; em very , very , very occasionally ,
and it &apos;s only when i know i &apos;m gonna be in trouble ,
like now .
it was inappropriate ,
not to mention manipulative and stupid .
you smoke ?
i know. okay , listen .
i know you have every right to be mad at me ,
but i ran out of options , so ...
it &apos;s an expensive test .
there was no indication to do it .
there &apos;s a reason webber turned you down !
so you didn &apos;t do it ?
of course i did it , arizona .
thank you .
no , don &apos;t thank me yet . the scan didn &apos;t show anything .
what ? ! come on , nothing ?
no .
okay , now that . that looks a little funny to me .
i thought so , too ,
but the radiologist said it &apos;s normal
oh , okay , all right. just ... here .
is there anything peculiar about his h &amp; p ?
sorry ! sorry .
just ...
uh , sorry. sorry . we &apos;re sorry. sorry !
we &apos;ll be sure to clean the countertop .
ugh. uh , you didn &apos;t used to do this before ,
and now it &apos;s kind of all the time , everywhere .
and ... and i didn &apos;t ...
yeah , well , you know , it &apos;s ... we &apos;re married now and ...
things have changed a little ,
but , uh , we &apos;re sorry about the countertop .
ah. um ... so you guys are ... you &apos;re really ...
that &apos;s it ? the post @-@ it , that &apos;s for real ?
yeah , that &apos;s for real .
what you reading ?
yeah , i got this patient i &apos;m trying to diagnose .
it &apos;s driving me nuts .
so take a break .
i miss you .
well , i &apos;m right here .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re here , but you &apos;re not here , and i miss you .
iz , come on . i &apos;m trying to work .
i &apos;m wishing for a brain tumor .
i &apos;m wishing all the time for a giant tumor
that would just press down on my brain
and make me hallucinate george ...
so that i could talk to him again ,
so i could laugh with him again .
i ...
i miss him ...
so much .
i miss him all the time , and i just want to feel better .
even for a minute , you know ?
i just want to be a person
who isn &apos;t wishing for a brain tumor
just for one minute .
and i can &apos;t drink because of the cancer meds .
i don &apos;t do drugs . i can &apos;t even work right now .
i don &apos;t have any distractions .
i &apos;m sad ... and i miss george .
so please ...
please ... come inside and help me feel better .
&quot; i miss george . &quot;
nice . real seductive
oh , hey. is , uh , mark around ?
he &apos;s in the shower .
oh , thanks .
hey , hav have you heard anything
about what &apos;s happening with the chief ?
there &apos;s all these rumors floating around mercy west ,
like he might be coming to work for us .
that would not go well for me .
i haven &apos;t heard anything .
i &apos;ll check with derek again .
thanks .
can you hand me the shampoo ?
thank you .
are you really gay ?
like , how gay are you ,
on a scale of ... of 1 to gay ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s my boyfriend in ... in the shower ,
my hot , hot , naked boyfriend , and i ...
ho ... how gay are you ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s ... i &apos;ve known mark a while , and--
but i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll try not to do that again ...
the naked in the shower thing .
or ... or the you half @-@ naked in the hallway thing ?
&apos;cause ... &apos; cause even if you really are gay ,
he ... he &apos;s not , and ... and you &apos;re hot .
he doesn &apos;t look at my boobs anymore .
the first thing he used to look at
when i walked in anywhere was my boobs .
he doesn &apos;t look anymore ,
not since he met you .
okay ?
okay
shepherd .
you &apos;re a hard man to track down .
i &apos;m busy , as you know .
yeah , scoping out mercy west .
you planning on jumping ship ?
&apos;cause i assume , as a friend ,
you would tell me if there &apos;s anything i need to know .
those are rumors , derek .
there are a lot of rumors .
and jennings isn &apos;t answering my calls anymore .
why are you calling jennings , jerek ?
i told you i would fill you in
when there was something to tell .
if you feel the need to go behind my back ,
at least do me ...
behind your back ?
behind your back ? i &apos;m the one who &apos;s got your back .
don &apos;t you forget that .
dr. shepherd .
yes .
do you have a minute ?
for what ?
a kid with a tethered spinal cord .
i just sat up in the middle of the night , and i thought ,
tethered spinal cord , but you &apos;re not gonna see it on there .
i need to run another test to confirm the diagnosis .
a tethered cord &apos;s pretty rare .
does he have a history of spina bifida ?
no .
lower back lesions , hyperreflexia ?
no and no , but the pain is aggravated
when he extends or flexes his spine .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say-- that the tethered cord should &apos;ve
shown up on the m.r.i. , but what if it didn &apos;t ?
what if what this kid needs is not another m.r.i.
but a much more specific c.t. myelogram ?
maybe. order one .
well , see , i can &apos;t , because if i did , i &apos;d get fired ...
and i really ... like my job .
did the chief deny that request ?
several times .
you should led with the part about the chief . come on .
you &apos;re doing great .
you &apos;re up , girl . i know .
who would &apos;ve thought standing could be so hard , right ?
you &apos;re doing awesome .
awesome .
put me down .
let &apos;s go a couple of more seconds. you &apos;re doing
put me down .
that was great .
take a sec , and then go again for me , okay ?
no
i know , clara. but this is where the hard part begins .
mcdreamy .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i get it now--
the whole , you know , mcdreamy thing .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t get it before .
but now i get it .
you know they call you that , right ?
yes .
i &apos;m involved , by the way ,
in case you thought that i was just coming on to you ,
because i was not .
plus , well , i heard that you got married .
so congratulations .
yes , thank you .
you wrote some hokey crap on a post @-@ it note
in the resident &apos;s lounge .
sorry , but until you &apos;re sweating it out in a morning coat
with a ball of white taffeta coming at you ,
you &apos;re not really married. oh , okay .
well , i &apos;ve consummated mine .
i consummate mine all the time .
how &apos;s that going for you , karev ?
girls talk. you might want to consider that
the next time you judge my post @-@ it .
i haven &apos;t cried yet .
i &apos;m using work and sex as a distraction ,
and i think it &apos;s working for me .
have you seen the girl amanda
sitting outside the hospital on that bench
all day long , every--
i miss sex .
oh , i miss it so muchmuch .
what ?
mer , wh
i &apos;m worried about clara. she &apos;s depressed .
but like a whole new level of depressed .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to do .
are you talking about ceviche ?
that ...
oh , my god. that &apos;s ... that is so rude. ceviche ?
that is so--that--it-- that &apos;s rude .
that--that-- that is so rude .
well , anyone else i can offend ?
a tethered spinal cord ?
one of the threads in his spinal cord
is attached to his tailbone .
normally the spinal cord is free at the end ,
but with it attached , when you grew , it started pulling .
thus the excruciating pain .
so can we fix it ? is it fixable ?
it &apos;s a microsurgery .
i &apos;ll snip the tethered cord , and he &apos;ll be free of pain .
she &apos;s not normally like this .
before all this , she was , like , a normal mom .
andy , this is a normal mom .
are we waiting for dr . swender ?
no. dr. swender has handed you off to me .
wh @-@ what are you , like , second year ?
third .
that &apos;s , um ...
can we page dr. swender or something ?
stevens , this is a good thing .
it is .
you still have cancer ,
but not enough to interest dr. swender anymore .
it is a good thing .
you &apos;re saying i have j.v. cancer ?
i &apos;m saying your mets have shrunk way down ,
and there are no new ones .
your protocol is working very effectively .
stevens .
this is about as good as the news gets .
so what-- what now ?
we &apos;re gonna use the port in your chest
to continue with your i.l.-2 regimen for now .
and we &apos;ll continue monitoring the progression of your disease
with pet @-@ scans every three to six months .
is there , uh , some kind of timeline on this or ...
your wife is living with cancer , dr. karev .
right now the cancer has stopped growing .
with a cancer this aggressive , that &apos;s pretty stunning success .
there &apos;s no timeline .
there &apos;s just ... we watch it .
we wait .
we hope it doesn &apos;t start to grow again .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
i see contractions in the anterior tibialis .
okay. that &apos;s the nerve root , not the filum .
bipolars and the microscissors , please .
want to make the cut ?
no. i @-@ i don &apos;t need to .
you know , without you ,
this kid probably would &apos;ve been a chronic pain patient
and possibly addicted to pain meds .
he owes his entire future to you .
you should make the cut .
put the scissor in .
there. nicely done .
clara , dr. grey says
you &apos;re still refusing your physical therapy .
now i understand it &apos;s hard .
but you have to work these muscles now ,
or they will atrophy and they &apos;ll heal incorrectly .
clara , you gotta do the work .
you know , you &apos;ve just got to do the work now .
clara , i know what it is to not want to live ,
to wish that you &apos;d died , to lose everything ...
to not want to ... call your mother .
believe it or not , i know exactly what that is .
i have been there .
but i am back now .
and as impossible as it felt ,
eventually ... i came back .
and so can you .
but you have got to do the work .
you have to get her admitted to psych .
committed ? you want me to have her committed ?
there &apos;s nothing more we can do. you have to make that call .
people are calling you &quot; ceviche . &quot;
dr. grey , you--
i mean , that &apos;s , you know ...
you can &apos;t go out like that , clara ,
with people calling you ceviche .

grief may be a thing we all have in common ...
but it looks different on everyone .
it isn &apos;t just death we have to grieve .
it &apos;s life ... it &apos;s change . it &apos;s loss ...
and when we wonder
why it has to suck so much sometimes ,
has to hurt so bad ...
the thing we gotta try to remember
is that it can turn on a dime ...
what is this ?
take off your pants .
iz , it &apos;s , uh ...
be my husband .
get undressed , get into bed and hold me .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re so mad about
and i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re scared of
because you won &apos;t talk to me .
but i &apos;m scared , too , alex , and i @-@ i can &apos;t--if you won &apos;t--
if we &apos;re gonna have any chance at a life together ,
then i need you to ... please .
you died in my arms .
you died in my arms .
you freakin &apos; died and then you left instructions
that i wasn &apos;t allowed to save your life .
you want to know what i &apos;m scared of ?
i &apos;m scared of everything !
i &apos;m scared to move ! i &apos;m scared to breathe !
i &apos;m scared to touch you !
i can &apos;t lose you . i won &apos;t survive .
and that &apos;s your fault .
you made me love you , you made me let you in ,
and then you freakin &apos; die in my arms !
that &apos;s how you stay alive .
when it hurts so much you can &apos;t breathe ,
that &apos;s how you survive ...
miranda .
by remembering that one day ,
somehow ...
impossibly ...
it won &apos;t feel this way .
it won &apos;t hurt this much .
look , i ... i am an attending ,
and i am a single mother ,
and i lost o &apos;malley ...
and , um ... i just can &apos;t--
i @-@ i can &apos;t care anymore .
stevens is not my child .
o &apos;malley was not my child .
i have to stop treating ... i ...
i just have to stop caring so much .
&apos;cause i can &apos;t keep fe-- feeling like this , feeling like this ,
n @-@ not at work .
i have to save the feeling for my son , who needs it .
so i just can &apos;t keep giving it away here .
i can &apos;t
i won &apos;t .
grief comes in its own time for everyone ...
in its own way .
so the best we can do ...
the best anyone can do ...
is try for honesty .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you again .
my problems , they &apos;re real .
and this , this makes us real .
it makes my problems your problems .
i &apos;m afraid .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you again .
you can sleep in the bathtub .
what ?
the really crappy thing ,
the very worst part of grief ,
is that you can &apos;t control it .
what are you doing ?
we need the space .
the best we can do
is try to let ourselves feel it when it comes ...
oh. thank you .
i was stuck with this intern today .
it took him four tries to throw in a central line .
reminded me a little bit of george , actually ,
when he was an intern .
and let it go when we can .
meredith .
the very worst part
is that the minute you think you &apos;re past it ,
it starts all over again .
and always , every time ...
george o &apos;malley died .
it takes your breath away .
there are five stages of grief .
they look different on all of us ,
but there are always five ...
i know you all have heard a lot of rumors .
and i &apos;m sorry for that .
denial
and what i &apos;m about to say will be hard to hear ,
and i &apos;m sorry for that as well .
anger
the economic climate is ... well , you all know what it is .
in the coming weeks , seattle grace hospital
will be merging with mercy west .
bargaining
i wish i could tell you
you will all survive the merger ,
but there are only so many jobs ,
and the board and i have some tough choices to make .
depression
i &apos;m on your side , people .
i &apos;m rooting for every one of you .
all i can say is ,
please ...
be at your very best .
