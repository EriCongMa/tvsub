Oh, my god, Ali's with Charles.
Cece?
They never understood how much I loved you.
You were like, my very own living doll.
Cece is Charles?
Does she think we came between her and Ali?
Is that what this has all been about?
Sara?
Cece, please don't do this.
Damn it.
Don't do this!
You've spent your whole life
trying to get back to your family.
No!
Game over.
I heard that Sara got released from the hospital today.
What happened to Sara that night wasn't our fault.
I can't believe we're actually leaving.
How lucky am I to have something
that makes saying goodbye so hard.
What brilliant scholar said that?
Winnie the pooh.
Don't look at me, I'm ready to hang a sign, "Bitch can see."
This is about betrayal?
It's not about betrayal, Spencer.
It's about revenge.
He knows we're lying.
So stop pining for the fjords and carpe hottie!
I know it's over.
I know that.
And yes.
I know the dead girl who isn't dead anymore.
"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
"I summon up remembrance of things past,
"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
"And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
"Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
"And weep afresh love's long since canceled woe,
"And moan the expense of many a vanished sight.."
I'm sorry. Uh, I got a little lost.
Tomorrow, you get to read to me.
Dr. Rollins, did we have an appointment?
I thought I'd let you know in person.
The judge set a date for the hearing?
Yes.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
It's happening in four days.
Four days?
It was four days, or six months.
Alison?
I want to enclose something in the court notifications.
I can take care of that.
Thank you.
Alison, I have to remind you
the court can compel your friends to come
but they may not be sympathetic to the cause.
You don't know them the way I do.
"There isn't much time, but I wanted you to see
"these words on paper and not a screen.
"I wanted to know you were touching
something I touched, that we were connected."
All set?
以斯拉·费兹
"We've been through things no other friends have experienced.
"We understand each other better than
"anyone else in the world."
Hi.
Thanks for watching her.
We had a nice long talk.
"But all that connects us to someone else.
"Someone I love. Someone who needs me.
"I know you're coming back to Rosewood
"to speak to the court about Charlotte being released.
"I'm asking for five minutes with you.
"Five minutes to explain.
"Five minutes that can change the whole world."
Do you think they'll come?
Of course they'll come.
It's been a long time.
Do you think they're still upset with me?
I will bring you home, Charlotte.
I promise.
Spencer, Aria, Hanna, Emily.
I need you. Please.
All my love, Alison.
Guess who?
Oh, my gosh.
Ah! God, I missed you.
I missed you too.
Oh, get a room. Ew!
We'll need a pretty big room. Hi!
Any hints about the fall collection?
My non-disclosure agreement is eight pages long.
Claudia would literally chase me down the runway
with an axe if I let anything slip.
Let me see this.
It looked bigger when you posted it.
So I suppose we're gonna need our passports
to attend the wedding.
Well, we're talking to several host nations.
But Italy is a strong contender.
I met a nice Italian girl one time.
No wonder it took you a year longer to finish college.
How's the Salk Institute?
Uh, good. I'm still trying to find my way around.
All that great Louis Kahn architecture.
I want a tour.
They're not doing tours right now, but..
How's Liam?
Liam is adorable.
But he hates when I tell people that.
Who is Spencer seeing?
Spencer is too busy to see anybody.
Wait, what about the ambassador's son?
Regime change.
So this court thing, are we going to be under oath?
No oath, it's just about how we feel
about Charlotte getting out.
No, tell the truth.
It is about "A" Getting out.
Five "A"-free years.
You have to admit, that felt good.
I mean, a lot has happened, good, bad and ugly,
but all of it was uncontaminated by "A."
And now "A" Wants to go home.
What are we gonna do?
We drop off our bags and we go meet Ali at 4 o'clock
and listen to what she has to say.
So how long can you stay?
I don't know. The hearing's tomorrow.
I'm glad you're here, but
I wish you didn't have to do this.
How about we focus on the that fact I'm here?
Right.
How's Greg?
We're taking a little break.
Why?
Em, it was just time for a break.
I thought you liked him.
Let's talk about that over tea, okay?
Wow, this is really amazing.
Thank you.
Seriously, you would never know that
this used to be a nut house.
Okay, we prefer the European definition
of "Sanitarium," when talking about this historic structure.
Well, it looks beautiful. You did a really good job.
Thanks.
Didn't it sort of creep you out though?
We evicted all the ghosts, Hanna.
Soon people will forget what this place was
and we'll just be remembered only for our exquisite brunch.
My mother, the exorcist.
I was hoping you'd bring Jordan with you.
Yeah, uh, next time.
I've been trying to get you back here
to see the place since we opened.
I know, but I've been busy.
Paris took forever.
But when Alison calls..
It isn't Alison, mom. It's the court.
It's still Alison.
She's been petitioning the court to get Charlotte
out of the hospital since the day she was locked up.
You don't owe Alison a thing.
After what that person did to you--
Mom, I know what she did to me.
And I know exactly what I'm gonna say to the judge.
Liam wanted you to have this.
The James Tiptree short stories you were talking about.
Is he trying to impress me?
Yes.
Well, he's off to a very good start.
He wants to know when you're coming back to Boston.
Not until the semester's over.
How long are you staying?
I just have to see how it goes.
So what did you think of the New Radley?
Haven't seen it yet, but I'm sure we'll get down there.
I thought that's where you were
meeting hanna and the other girls.
No, we met at the brew. Old habits.
The brew?
Yeah, that's right. Why?
Did you see Ezra there?
He's back.
He still owns the place, and I heard that
he's moved into the apartment upstairs.
I thought he was still in South America.
No, apparently, he got sick and they sent him home.
I haven't talked to him, but I've seen him in town.
Did you know the girl?
Nicole?
I met her once.
A long time ago. Before they left.
Fifteen dead or missing.
They were down there building houses.
That's not supposed to be controversial.
Have you talked to him?
No, I wrote him a letter when Nicole...
When it happened, but I never heard back from him.
Hastings for state senate. The clear, true voice.
I'm Veronica Hastings
and I approve this message.
The flag's a really nice touch.
I never would have thought of it.
Don't be cynical, Spencer.
Where's dad?
In Harrisburg, raising money.
The family that campaigns together, stays together.
Your father is a champion arm twister
and we need the cash.
It's an off-year special election,
winning might come down to if it rains that day
and people decide to stay home.
Oh, now who's being cynical?
It's your fault I'm doing this.
You got involved in government first. You inspired me.
I watch the government, I keep it honest. That's what I do.
Sweetheart, you work for a lobbyist.
No, we are not lobbyists.
We work with grassroots political organizations
to advance progressive legislation.
You're a lobbyist..
and your mother is going to be a state senator.
I'm so proud of you.
Your bosses are very angry with me.
They're not angry.
They gave me an advance on the second book.
They know what happened in South America.
They understand.
Well, then they're ahead of me
because I don't understand any of it.
I don't understand how a girl that I met in this shop
who never hurt anybody, can be dragged off
by half-baked revolutionaries,
and no one can seem to find her.
So, if you understand that, explain it to me.
You go somewhere to help, it shouldn't cost you your life.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
When did you get here?
Uh, just a couple of hours ago.
This is really impressive.
I, I, uh, I just wanted to see if I could do it.
How's it going?
Ah, it's harder than I thought.
I curse a lot. It's very therapeutic.
How's Washington?
Um, I curse a lot. It's very therapeutic.
Uh, Caleb said he saw you there.
Oh, yeah? You guys talk?
Uh, now and then.
We went, uh, we went fishing last summer.
Seriously?
Yeah.
We're the brotherhood of ex-boyfriends.
We gotta stick together.
So, you in town for your mom's campaign?
No, uh, I got a request from the state of Pennsylvania.
They would like my opinion on something.
Ali's trying to get Charlotte out of the hospital.
Yeah. We're here to talk to the court.
We?
Aria, Em, Hanna, and me.
All of you in one place at one time.
When's the last time that happened in Rosewood?
Long time.
When Alison flashes the bat signal--
It's not like that, you know, we're still friends
and we're not just, "Let's go see a movie and have dinner"
kinda friends, but the "I saved your life, now you save mine"
kinda friends.
You know. You were there.
How long are you gonna be here for?
Well, the hearing's tomorrow.
And then, and then I don't really know.
Can I... buy you a dinner before you leave?
Yeah. Sure, we can do that.
Um, I, I should go though. I'm supposed to be meeting Ali.
And I'm already late. So, I'll call you, okay.
Still the same number?
Same number.
Cool.
Toby,
who are you building the house for?
What makes you think I'm building it for somebody?
Because I know you.
Charlotte is getting the help
she never had when she was little.
Five years of treatment, undoing all the damage.
I visit her, I spend time with her.
She even stayed at my house for a weekend last Christmas.
They let her out?
It was a supervised visit.
So Charlotte is all better now.
What does this have to do with us?
At the hearing tomorrow, the judge will decide
if she should be released.
And they want to hear from people who were involved.
Victim statements.
Statements of support.
Statements that she isn't a threat to anybody.
That you guys are not afraid of her anymore.
There is no reason to be afraid.
You know her.
You heard her story. We all went through this together.
Yes, we did.
We have the scars to prove it too.
You're asking us to give a get-out-of-jail-free card
to someone who tried to kill us.
She's in a hospital, Hanna. She's not in jail.
She's lucky.
And we're lucky to be alive.
That's why your statements would mean so much.
Who else is speaking?
Mona demanded to be heard.
She's going to talk to the judge about
the dollhouse, and being tortured.
What about Sara Harvey?
What about her?
Well, suppose we do talk to the judge..
they march in Sara Harvey.
She gives a few choice words about
what happened to her that night at Radley?
She's not allowed to testify because of how
her criminal charges were resolved.
Why isn't Jason here?
He doesn't agree with Dr. Rollins and me.
Okay, you realize what you're asking us to do.
You want us to forgive Charlotte.
I don't care if you forgive her.
I'm asking you to give me my only chance at a real family.
Alison, we're here to say how we feel
and you're asking us to lie.
Please, do this.
Do this for me.
Pretty please?
With sugar on top?
What?
That's what you say on a playground to exact a favor.
We're not on the playground anymore, Alison.
We haven't been for a long time.
Please?
I am not one of those candidates who runs for office
telling you how much I hate the government
and wanna take it apart.
Like you, I understand that the size of the problem
dictates the size of the solution needed.
If being honest and truthful is so damn purifying..
why do I feel like the bottom of somebody's shoe?
Government is big enough to do.
Our courts are not the enemy of freedom.
Look, they have the reports.
Okay, they know what Charlotte did to us when she was "A."
We don't need to talk about that.
All we've to say is that we're not afraid of her.
That's all Ali wants.
Then we get the hell out of here.
Is it the truth? That we're not afraid?
Maybe it is. I mean, look at us.
We did get away. We won.
Maybe we didn't kill the dragon, but we definitely tamed it.
Um, I'll be right back.
No one feels safe where anyone can be victimized.
Your mom's doing well in the polls
for such an untested candidate.
Hi, Mona.
I waved at you at the Kennedy Center Reception.
You didn't see me.
I'm sorry.
Look at us, all this time
and we both end up in the same business.
Um, not really.
We both sell policy.
Different kinds of policy.
Do you still have nightmares?
I do.
Three shrinks and a whole lot of prescriptions
but I still have bad dreams.
How about you?
Now, I'd like to introduce one of the reasons
why I'm running for office.
My daughter, Spencer Hastings.
Don't miss your cue.
Spencer and I just... went out of sync.
It happens.
I-I-I like this town, but everywhere she went
it was like she saw something that she wanted to forget.
I wouldn't have pictured you and Ali to be the ones to stay.
Different reasons, same results.
You got your degree, didn't you?
Took a while, mostly nights, but I got it.
Didn't do much good this year.
Got passed over for promotion.
College wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.
I look at Aria, Spencer, and even Hanna
it all seemed to click for them.
Not for you?
No.
I had a hard time.
When my dad died, I just couldn't see a point to it.
To the college?
To anything.
My family has always had a missing part.
What's missing is my sister Charlotte.
Past five years I've gotten to know
come to love this missing part of my family.
And now, I wanna bring my sister home.
I'm sure that you've read all of the documents
about who Charlotte is, and what she's done to us.
Those are just reports.
One thing that I've learned from all of this is that
people are not always the things that they do.
Charlotte Dilaurentis poses no threat to me.
I was angry for a long time.
But now, every morning I wake up..
I drink coffee, and I walk outside.
It's either sunny or it's raining, but there I am.
I'm free.
I don't see why Charlotte shouldn't have the same chance
to get caught in the rain as I do.
No, I'm not afraid of her.
My dad taught me that fear is natural.
It's a good instinct.
He also said that you can decide
what you're going to be afraid of.
I decided I'm not afraid of Charlotte Dilaurentis.
Alison and Dr. Rollins have told us
how well Charlotte's been doing.
How rapidly she's been able to integrate herself
into the general hospital population.
They feel strongly that--
I'm sorry.
Miss Montgomery.
Sorry.
They feel strongly..
that now is the right time for Charlotte--
Miss Montgomery, I've read the same reports that you have.
Well, the doctors--
The doctors can speak for themselves.
You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe
should Charlotte Dilaurentis leave the hospital.
Miss montgomery?
No.
No, I would not feel safe.
I was on the redline
going to Braintree..
and the train stopped in the tunnel
between the stations.
The power went out and, and it was dark.
No, not dark. It was black.
And I was back in every box
in every dark tight place that
"A" ever put me in, and I couldn't breathe.
Then I heard a girl crying.
Good. I thought somebody else is scared out of her mind.
Then...The power came back on
And every single person on that train
was staring at me.
Because I was the girl that was crying.
I don't want Charlotte released.
Ever.
Here comes the last nail in the coffin.
I thought I could do this, but I can't.
I've been listening to my friends
how they've managed to forgive Charlotte.
I wish I could hate her, but I can't.
I can't, because I know what she went through.
I was in Radley sanitarium.
I was there for months.
Charlotte was there for years, and years.
Being in that place is what twisted her all out of shape.
Let her out.
Let her go home.
That's all any of us want.
Is to have a home.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay with this?
It's a little bit strange.
We can go somewhere else, when they get here.
No, if you're gonna chase away the demons
you have to go to where the demons are.
You know who I thought was gonna walk into that hearing room?
Who?
Sara Harvey.
They said that she wouldn't be there.
Or what if she did show up?
We tell our little white lies, and in she walks.
"These bitches are lying, your honor."
"Wanna know what they're really like?"
"Let me show you what they did to me."
And she shows everybody.
艾莉
So, that's that.
"The judge says Charlotte can go home."
"Thanks for your help, Ali."
Did you guys see?
We saw.
Everyone, say hello to the only honest woman in town.
I'm sorry.
No, we're sorry.
You're small, but you are mighty.
You put us all to shame.
Alright, everyone turn your phones off.
Not silent, not vibrate, off.
I can't turn my phone all the way off.
Spencer, one of the lifesaving pieces of information
I've learned, is that these things
actually have an off button.
Do it, Spencer.
Okay!
The coven of the sacred cocktails is now in session.
You know, if you didn't know what this place was
you'd never know what this place was.
Said the real estate agent showing you
around "The house on haunted hill."
I miss your faces.
You guys have such excellent faces.
Thank you.
Or we should plan on seeing each other more often.
Yes, but not here.
Ugh, we can make a list of beautiful cities
and go to each one of them.
And that can get expensive.
Paris, Rome
Madrid, Rio.
We can party in every one of them.
And Ali and Charlotte can sit in that big, ugly house
and they can bake cookies.
You'd think a place like this, they'd have...Special drinks.
What kind of special drinks?
We're sitting in a bar, in what used to be a squirrel factory.
But no, like, an electroshock Margarita?
Manic depressive Mai tai?
You guys are seriously lacking in any good taste.
That's why I love you so much.
I love each one of you.
Spencer loves us.
So I heard.
Hey, uh, can we get another bipolar Martini
for my friend over here?
Last call in Rosewood.
Can we just go someplace and dance?
That's why god invented the mini-bar, em.
We can go back to my suite.
'tis but the crank of the evening.
Hey, don't.
My mom runs this joint.
You guys wanna hear something funny?
I'd love to hear something funny.
I thought it wouldn't matter what we said to the judge..
Because I thought they would never let her out.
I thought that we could just lie for Ali
one more time and it wouldn't matter.
But it did.
They let "A" Out.
Wouldn't it just be the biggest cosmic joke ever
if Charlotte gets to live happily ever after?
If she can do it, so can we.
A toast to Charlotte.
To Charlotte.
To Charlotte.
Why can't they make quiet ice cubes?
Here, hydrate.
Thanks.
Are you going to see Toby?
I already did.
He's building a house.
He's building a house?
With tools?
By himself?
Yup.
Yeah. Wow, indeed.
All I got was a chair, and some lucky girl
is gonna get an entire house.
Sit. Stay.
She's not a poodle.
Hello.
Hanna, it's me.
Hi, Ali.
Did Charlotte come to your hotel room last night?
Mm, no she didn't, what's wrong?
I don't know where she is.
You don't know where Charlotte is?
Dr. Rollins brought her home last night.
We talked for hours, she was so happy and grateful.
We went to bed, and this morning she was gone.
All of her stuff is here but she isn't.
Dr. Rollins wants me to call the police.
Yeah, you should.
Can you call the others and come over?
Yeah, I will, but, Ali, don't wait.
Call the police.
Please hurry.
Charlotte was there when they went to sleep
and now she's gone.
The sexton found her.
He got here for morning service, he saw the door had been forced.
Checked the building, went to the bell tower
and saw the open shutter and looked down.
Do we know what time this happened?
Sprinklers are on a timer, grass under the body is wet
but her clothes are dry.
Puts it between 3 a.m. and first light.
Are you sure about the identification?
Hospital ID card, and I saw her face.
It's Charlotte Dilaurentis.
Stay with her until she falls asleep.
I will.
Are you alright?
If I thought there was any chance
of Charlotte taking her own life, I..
I-I never would've let her leave the hospital.
Sorry, um, I thought that you were room service.
I'm afraid not.
Spencer called me.
She told me what happened.
Spencer called you?
Yeah, I saw her in Washington.
I'm-I'm actually thinking about working for her outfit.
I was with her when she got the letter.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Why are you here?
Sorry, um..
It's been a very wrong day
and I didn't expect you to show up on my doorstep
or anywhere else.
Yeah, uh, Spencer told me about Charlotte
and, um...I don't know.
Maybe it was a conditioned reflex
but...I thought I could help.
Well, I'm glad to know that your reflexes still work.
You okay?
Well, we came here to help Ali
and Charlotte killed herself.
We could've just kept our mouths shut
and she would still be
in a nice, safe hospital.
Instead, we have another funeral to get through.
Yeah.
I thought I might stick around for that.
Well, my mom can set you up with a room here, if you want.
Uh, no, that's okay, actually, um
I'm staying in Spencer's barn.
So how've you been?
I've been okay.
Are you still in New York?
Yeah, I travel a lot more for the collection.
Still a roadie for a bunch of dresses.
That's me.
Yeah.
Well, if you need anything
you know where to find me.
Right.
Why didn't you call me before you came over?
I wasn't sure that you would let me in.
Why wouldn't I let you in?
We're still friends, aren't we?
Yeah.
Of course we are.
Then I'll talk to you later.
How was it?
Complicated.
Yeah.
That's why I wanted to stay down here.
Thanks for calling me.
I appreciate it.
I'm really glad that you're here.
It's, uh, it's kinda strange
what they did to this place, huh?
Yeah, I think it's like cultural amnesia.
Yeah, well, people get do-overs
why shouldn't buildings?
This isn't happening.
I'm gonna bring the car.
Okay.
What is she doing here?
Making sure that Charlotte's really dead.
Really, most sincerely dead.
Let's go.
Hello.
Lorenzo.
How are you?
Alright.
Under the circumstances.
I was wondering what your plans are
for the next couple of days.
If you're gonna stay in Rosewood.
Why?
It'd make it easier if you stayed.
Make what easier?
We have the autopsy report on Charlotte DiLaurentis.
Charlotte was dead when she was thrown from the bell tower.
Thrown?
She was murdered?
The death's been ruled a homicide, yeah.
You'll get a call.
Was someone waiting for Charlotte
to get released so they can kill her?
Don't go there.
Spencer, we've lived there for a long time.
It's not like it's a long commute.
I wanna go home.
