i heard the door and then his voice , &quot; i &apos;m home . &quot;
i fucking wanted to vomit .
after all that worry he might be dead , praying he was okay .
my heart just sank and i wished ...
he had died .
to just come and go year after year like that .
how dare he ?
have you reached out to him ?
that &apos;s a good one .
listen .
and i don &apos;t want my kids to know this .
they found a lump under my arm .
they biopsied it .
i get the results in a few days .

then he went back to whatever he was doing .

i didn &apos;t have to go then .

grazie .
this song , jesus !
i &apos;ve been to italy many times and really ...
... you &apos;re not missing all that much .
the sexual harassment that i was subjected to .
i went with my friend zane .
her , they didn &apos;t bother . me , they couldn &apos;t keep their hands off .
much less the whistling and the hooting .
it &apos;s not ltaly .
remember angie bompensiero ?
angie belfiore . married sal bompensiero .
she &apos;s thinking of divorcing him .
hallelujah !
you know them ?
no , but to be married to a man like that .
a man like what ?
the attitude , the medieval outlook .
he is such an adoring father , though .
three beautiful kids they raised , who are now from a broken home .
no sons , i hope . three more of his ilk , we don &apos;t need .
he &apos;s very macho .
macho ? no .
try swaggering mama &apos;s boy , hypocrite , shall we ?
hypocrites ?
carm ...
... come on , stop . just stop .
is that how you see your brother ?
we were talking about angie .
these o.c. pricks , especially . with their prostitutes .
emotional cripples .
they expect their wives to live like the nuns at mt . carmel college .
it &apos;s not that simple .
of course not .
madonna / whore is the full equation , i believe .
clothes ...
... and appliances ...
... and houses ...
you are talking about me ? about us ?
carmela , no .
i don &apos;t know .
that a woman of your intelligence ...
... is content to ask so little from life and from herself .
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m ...
it &apos;s none of my business .
marriage is a holy sacrament .
okay .
family is a sacred institution .
roger .
and you ...
... trying to fan the flames with richie aprile ?
talk about old school .
richie , because of his experience in prison ...
... he &apos;s sensitive to the plight of women .
oh , my god !
i am not gonna touch that one .
but you had me going for a while there . oh , janice , honey ...
... i gotta love you . really .
nice shot !
i shank him .
well , it &apos;s a man &apos;s club .
i &apos;ll send you one your size .
whole set .
so , tony .
you don &apos;t mind me calling you tony ?
what can i do for you ?
you could introduce me to the boss .
you can talk to me .
a fucking woman boss ?
so , what do you want ?
never happen in the states . never .
our men kill each other .
all my brothers , for example . they all got murdered .
or they go to prison .
rome has a war against us .
but the men are in love to their mama , huh ?
so obeying a woman is not ...
come si dice ? it comes natural .
well , i &apos;ll be dipped in shit .
you act like your father &apos;s nursemaid .
i am his nursemaid .
if an old man carries the respect of the troops , you keep him around .
i did something like that myself .
we are cousins .
you hungry ?
i could eat .
so ...
... you wanted to talk about business ?
can i ask you a question ?
we won &apos;t pay the price on the mercedes .
why do you save your toenail clippings ?
why ?
you want them ?
if your enemy comes into possession of your nail or hair clippings ...
... they can make the evil on you .
i &apos;m flattered you &apos;d trust me ,
but can i pass without ruining the moment ?
i already burned them . nobody gets them .
cocksuckers .
a lot of guys become soft living in america .
not one in five guys , they &apos;re a fucking rat .
can &apos;t find anybody that believes in the old ways :
keeping silent . putting the family first .
so you want naples &apos; guys .
fucking clairvoyant over here .
that way i get guys with no ties over there .
they &apos;d be loyal to me , 110 percent .
what ?
what do i get ?
you get an obvious advantage to having your guys there .
how much you pay me for this man ?
pay you ?
your profitability is gonna go way up .
who are you thinking ?
well , furio to start .
furio !
take it easy !
i give you one of my best men ...
... and all i get are numbers in the air !
with all due respect , hon , you &apos;re being shortsighted .
he &apos;s my cousin , one of my best men . it &apos;s not gonna happen .
i &apos;m asking you nice .
or what ?
hey , look , i don &apos;t even think you understand ...
talk to your husband .
my husband ? fuck you !
he &apos;s never coming back . you have to fucking deal with me .
up your ass !
you &apos;re up .
where &apos;s my other belt ?
did you look under the bed ?
fuck , yeah !
i just came from the doctor &apos;s office .
yeah ?
the biopsy came back negative .
yeah , good . i &apos;ll be back later .
the 3 : 32 to mount vesuvius is now leaving at the side entrance .
pussy !
yeah .
what are you doing here ?
i was nearby .
the bachelor party &apos;s looking for entertainment .
enough said . want some coffee ?
i &apos;m good .
come on , it &apos;s on the boil .
yeah ?
boss say to tell you one hour .

i want to get out of here . you drive me to the city ?
sure . absolutely .
i have to ask .
what &apos;s it like , working for a woman ?
what are you gonna do ?
a woman boss ?
in america you don &apos;t have ?
no .
what ?
come down to eat .
jesus , is that all you people do ?
we had a huge lunch .
we need to finish our business .
i said all i &apos;m gonna say .
all right , i &apos;m coming down .
yeah , i know . for indigestion , right ?
cheers .
so , what is this place ?
my father was born in this house .
later , we make the new one .
you were born here and your kids are raised next door .
it &apos;s a nice thing .
you take good care of your father .
what are you going to do ? send him to ospizio ?
hey .
listen ...
this one needs to be stayed with until he goes to sleep , huh ?
i &apos;ll take you back in the morning .
good night .
it was horrible , what he did .
might as well have fucking cancer .
what did the lawyer say today ?
i have a good case and we &apos;ll file on tuesday .
you &apos;re gonna take monday to think ?
monday &apos;s a jewish holiday .
oh .
i &apos;m finished thinking .
i thought myself into nonexistence !
well , you are not nonexistent .
and pussy doesn &apos;t see you that way .
fuck what he sees !
not anymore ! it &apos;s what i see !
god gave me more years , carmela .
this very morning , god gave me a gift !
and i will use that gift !
i won &apos;t waste it like i &apos;ve wasted 24 fucking years with this man !
you know what the church says about divorce .
come on .
let the pope live with him .
what about the kids ?
they &apos;re 19 , 21 and 24 . it &apos;s time we all grew up .
kevin is just starting his sophomore year of college .
he &apos;ll know you stayed together , waiting for him to leave .
he only cares about not losing privileges at our house on the shore .
he &apos;s so fond of his father . that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
and terri and scott with their money problems and the pregnancy ...
you want to set this example when your daughter &apos;s struggling ...
... to keep her marriage alive ?
why are you working this hard ?
why ?
for all of the reasons i just said . because you are my friend .
i &apos;m not even saying don &apos;t .
at the very least , you gotta ask yourself these questions .
they &apos;re not even sure terri can have children of her own .
sal began to cry when he heard that .
oh , honey . come here .
in the end , i know you &apos;re not gonna leave him .
i know you won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m from america .
hey , cara mia , on your way back ...
... bring me one of those plums from the breakfast tray .
never mind .
i gotta hand it to you . great fruit you got here .
none of them fucking steroids .
come si dice &quot; steroids &quot; ?
there you go . who said you &apos;re not a great conversationalist ?
fucking twat .
there &apos;s my little fragolina .
hey , the customer &apos;s always right .
did i say you should leave ?
you know , my grandfather was neapolitan .
he went to america in 1910 .
three thousand miles
all by himself .
i &apos;m neapolitan . me and tony both .
some of the guys are sicilians .
hotheaded bastards . am i right ?
so , what part of naples you from ?
ariano irpino .
you &apos;re shitting me ! that &apos;s where my grandfather &apos;s from .
we come from the same town !
our families probably know each other .
the island back there is called progida .
madonna , look at this .
i gotta bring my kids here .
show them all this .
in olden time , the sibyl of cumae ...
... was the second most important oracle after delphi .
i thought delphi was in greece .
the greeks were here .
way before the romans .
and before the greeks , there was somebody else .
and before them , somebody else .
rulers would come from across the world ...
... to hear the sibyl &apos;s predictions of their future .
she would sit inside the cave inhaling gases ... &quot;
i think i dated this broad .
possibly volcanic , no longer active , and would speak in a voice not her own .
delivering unto them their fates . &quot;
let &apos;s go into the cave .
the sibyl sat way back there . see that shaft of light ?
it &apos;s a fucking trip .
the sibyl were very beautiful in most cases .
oh , yeah ?
got a premonition for me ?
you ?
you &apos;re no problem to read .
you are your own worst enemy .
oh , is that right ?
right now , you remind me of somebody from back home .
not your wife .
your girlfriend ?
oh , i got one .
to answer your question .
but no .
not her .
but she &apos;s someone you want to fuck .
i can tell .
oh , really ?
you know , everybody &apos;s their own worst enemy .
so maybe your psychic power has been overrated a little bit .
you don &apos;t want to fuck her ?
you don &apos;t want to fuck me ?
yeah , i do .
but i don &apos;t shit where i eat .
it &apos;s bad business . we &apos;re in business .
not at those price .
all right .
you give me furio ...
... and i &apos;ll whack down the price of the cars to 85 .
okay .
i get more guys .

he &apos;s in the duty @-@ free buying a gift for ade .
