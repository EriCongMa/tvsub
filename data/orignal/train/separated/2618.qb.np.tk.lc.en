you lie .
would a simple servant of god have this ?
you &apos;re no more a priest than i am .
here &apos;s your burning bush .
so talk to your god .
this is burke .
op @-@ sec 3828 .
we have a situation .

officer collins .
martin wilcox . we spoke on the phone .
of course . detective , thanks for coming .
susan , this is detective wilcox with metro p.d.
i &apos;ve brought him up to speed .
mrs. ames , we &apos;ll do whatever we can to find your husband .
thanks .
eugene disappears sometimes to atlantic city , once to vegas ,
but he always calls ,
and he &apos;s never gone for more than a few days .
and i understand there &apos;s some incident
that happened before his absence --
eugene came home .
he said he got an anonymous tip
about trespassers over by one of the marina docks .
the lieutenant went to check it out ,
came back about an hour later ,
said he got the scare of his life .
he ran into an fbi agent on one of the old ships ,
said she pulled out a gun as he was boarding .
an fbi agent ?
said the fbi was looking for two fugitives
who escaped cumberland the night before .
if something happened to eugene , it &apos;s got to be one of them .
don &apos;t you think ?
this agent he spoke with --
is there any chance your husband got a name ?
he did better than that . she gave him a card .
特别探员
special agent elizabeth keen .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was ... i think it contains some kind of message .
where &apos;d you get it ?
i need you to see if you can figure out
what it is , how it works .
there are people who are far more qualified
at this kind of thing than me .
but none that i know and trust .
i hope i &apos;m interrupting .
yes .
no . no .
you &apos;re not answering your phone .
so leave a message .
dembe did . two , in fact .
we have a new case , agent keen .
then tell cooper .
that &apos;s not how this works .
i think i left my soup in the microwave .
lobster bisque .
i know exactly how this works .
you lie , say what you need to say
to make me believe you actually care --
that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;re after the fulcrum . it &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
not to help me or protect me
or whatever spin you &apos;re selling today .
well , i &apos;m not buying it .
from this point on , there &apos;s no reason for us to talk
unless it &apos;s about the work .
fine . then let &apos;s work .
i think you &apos;ll find today &apos;s most intriguing story on page 20,
bottom @-@ left corner .
&quot; according to uzbek authorities ,
father aleksandr nabiyev ,
a local priest in the tashkent region of uzbekistan &quot; --
you &apos;re intrigued because a priest was kidnapped ?
no . i &apos;m intrigued because the priest is not a priest .
from what i hear ,
he good father nabiyev is an agent of the cia .
that &apos;s a crime , agent keen .
going back to the cold war ,
the cia has a long and controversial history
of using religious figures as spies
in violation of executive orders ,
internal cia policy ,
and promises made by every president since ford .
and you know who kidnapped this agent ?
i do .
unfortunately , he &apos;s an associate of mine .
his name is ruslan denisov .
he commands a nasty , little band of separatists
known as s.r.u.
translated , they are the supreme republic
of a free , righteous , and independent uzbekistan .
i told ruslan it was a bit much ,
but he can be quite melodramatic ,
not to mention violent and entirely unreasonable .
politics are his passion ,
and to fund his separatist agenda ,
he &apos;s become something of an abduction mogul ,
specializing in senior executives of foreign corporations
working in or passing through the region .
he holds them for ransom
at prices far above market standard .
your company has made it clear
it has no interest in paying for your release .
and you do business with this man ?
don &apos;t underestimate the usefulness
of a nasty band of armed separatists .
but lately , ruslan &apos;s been breaking promises .
his temper has cost me and my partners
considerably more than he &apos;s worth .
so everybody wins .
you help us rescue the agent ,
we eliminate a thorn in your side .
careful on this one , lizzy .
you have more than just a blacklister
to worry about this time .
the cia will do whatever it takes to keep this quiet .
richard gagnon , executive v.p.
for a french video @-@ component manufacturer .
here he is before he was taken ...
... and here he is the day s.r.u. released him
in exchange for $ 2 million cash .
we have a list of over 30 victims .
i don &apos;t understand . this guy makes a fortune
taking corporate execs .
now he takes a cia agent .
why change the business model ?
let &apos;s find him and ask .
i &apos;m sorry , but people &apos;s faith is sacred .
religion should be off @-@ limits to spies .
wouldn &apos;t work in my country .
yeah , well , the agency knows the law ,
so they &apos;ve gone this far ,
something big is going on in that area .
it &apos;s a simple question , mr. heyworth .
is father nabiyev an operative of the cia or not ?
we all know that would be illegal .
that &apos;s not an answer to my question .
not to my knowledge .
look , i didn &apos;t call this meeting
to make a case against the agency .
we &apos;re here because i have an informant
who i think can help get your man back safely .
if he were our man -- and i &apos;m saying &quot; if &quot; --
the agency would prefer to handle this on its own .
if an american citizen &apos;s been kidnapped overseas ,
that &apos;s fbi jurisdiction .
if he &apos;s your asset , i can keep you involved .
if not , you &apos;re out .
agent cooper , your task force
will run point on the investigation
and any hostage negotiations .
my people can leave tonight .
commander kushan .
i &apos;m agent keen . this is agent ressler .
on behalf of the bureau , we appreciate your help .
let me be very clear , agent keen .
it is you who are here to help me .
this is an uzbek military operation .
all due respect , sir ,
an american citizen has been abducted .
which is why we have extended the courtesy of our invitation .
but you will not be negotiating with ruslan denisov ,
and you will not be negotiating with me .
and you will turn over your firearms .
if that &apos;s a problem and you wish to return to your country --
no . no problem .
my men will escort you to your hotel .
we &apos;re being watched . 1 : 00 .
i didn &apos;t notice him .
i was too busy checking out hugo boss on the corner .
whoever he is , he isn &apos;t a fed .
that suit wasn &apos;t bought on a government salary .
the other one , the watercolorist ,
she -- legs like a shot @-@ putter .
she gets me in this headlock .
i black out .
next thing i know , i wake up , no sheets ,
vaseline everywhere .
the lipstick on the mirror overhead reads ,
&quot; same time next year ? &quot;
i haven &apos;t missed an art expo in basel since .
lizzy ! please excuse me .
what are you doing here ?
i promised to help .
i can &apos;t be an effective resource
if i &apos;m thousands of miles from the action .
it &apos;s not safe .
we just saw the cia at the airport .
they see you ...
i &apos;ll be sure to say hello .
uzbekistan has no extradition treaty
with the united states .
who are your friends over there ?
go get cleaned up . we &apos;ll have dinner .
i know a wonderful little hole in the wall
that &apos;s actually in a hole in the wall .
what &apos;s going on with you and reddington ?
you two have a little lovers &apos; quarrel ?
i don &apos;t trust him .
reddington &apos;s untrustworthy ?
welcome to my country .
the fbi in uzbekistan --
for a year , i tried to get your attention .
now here you are
because the only thing americans understand is violence .
if you know so much about americans ,
you &apos;d know that our government
doesn &apos;t pay ransoms to terrorists .
one man &apos;s terrorist , another man &apos;s freedom fighter .
i don &apos;t want your money -- not for myself , anyway .
as you can see , business is good .
i took your agent burke for another reason completely .
burke -- that &apos;s his name ?
almost 25 years ago ,
my country sold an american company , anneca oil ,
the rights to build a pipeline
through tashkent to andijan region .
the price was absurd .
the uzbek people received a fraction of the value .
corruption -- well , you know .
these things happen , and i don &apos;t care .
but now , the pipeline is leaking .
leaking ?
hundreds of villagers have been killed ,
hundreds more are sick , and the company does nothing .
our lawyers are no match for your wealthy attorneys .
the american embassy looks away .
the cia is here , watching , doing nothing ,
reporting on any threats to your american interests .
mr. denisov --
i took one of theirs .
a vice president of anneca oil .
i tell him that there are chemicals in the water that we drink ,
that our children bathe in .
but he says no .
the company did tests . the water is safe .
so i did a test of my own .
i give him back to you now to show you my good faith
so you can show the others the truth .
the negotiations for your agent burke begin tomorrow .
we saw hostages , at least four .
i don &apos;t think agent burke was one ,
but he &apos;s probably there .
we have got to find that compound .
that won &apos;t be easy .
the local army can &apos;t even find them .
well , we got your photo of the guy denisov released --
the anneca v.p. --
compared it to known company execs
and got a match -- jeffrey hanover .
how long ago was he taken ?
that &apos;s the thing . i don &apos;t know .
from what i can tell ,
anneca never reported him missing .
you &apos;re kidding .
they tried to handle it privately .
if that pipeline is leaking ,
the last thing they want is attention .
yeah , well , i &apos;ll tell you one thing .
whatever it was eating at hanover &apos;s flesh ,
it wasn &apos;t just water .
he should survive .
his skin has been burned , corroded .
and the chemicals ?
it &apos;s certainly consistent
with prolonged exposure to benzene
and polycyclic hydrocarbons
commonly associated with oil development .
thank you , doctor .
agent ressler . dean walker , e.v.p. at anneca .
just wanted to say thanks for bringing jeff home .
it &apos;s all part of the job .
i just flew in . company sent me straightaway .
if there &apos;s anything you need , i &apos;m here to help .
yeah , i doubt that .
we saw you this morning watching us at the airport .
how long have you really been here ?
three weeks .
the company sent me to deal with denisov ,
see if we could work something out .
privately ?
jeff &apos;s family wanted it that way .
they were afraid if the fbi got involved --
maybe you &apos;re the ones who were afraid .
anneca &apos;s got nothing to hide .
this leak denisov keeps talking about --
he &apos;s the one responsible . it &apos;s a scam .
his men sabotage the pipeline and then demand a fortune
because the locals are getting sick .
so this is how you respect my operation ?
i told you , you have no authority here .
denisov contacted us .
commander , i know this is your case ,
but if denisov wants to talk to the fbi --
not an option .
it &apos;s an option if denisov says it &apos;s an option .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s holding an american hostage .
yes , a frenchman , a german , and many others .
i &apos;m sorry . you can &apos;t order us not to talk to him .
i could arrest you and your partner
for interfering in my investigation .
what investigation ?
you &apos;ve been tracking this guy and his group for over a year .
he &apos;s still abducting innocent people ,
holding them for ransom --
you and your partner
will remain at the tashlan hotel under military guard .
if you try to leave ,
your stay in uzbekistan
will be a lot longer than you bargained for , hmm ?
well , you certainly make friends fast .
truth is , i &apos;m impressed .
not with you , with ruslan .
he never really struck me as a man of the people .
the guy &apos;s a psychopath . he &apos;s in over his head .
he doesn &apos;t know anything about pipelines .
agent keen is late .
she &apos;s having room service .
what , are you in the doghouse ?
oh , that &apos;s a shame .
she &apos;s gonna miss
the most tantalizingly delicious khorem baklava .
ruslan &apos;s a criminal .
even if anneca comes to the table ,
denisov would have no idea what to ask for .
the guy doesn &apos;t even know enough to know what he wants .
the lawyers would eat him for lunch .
you may be right .
when &apos;s the next sit @-@ down ?
tomorrow morning .
well , given your new entourage ,
i gather you may need my help to attend .
actually , i think we &apos;ve got that covered .
mr. denisov , thank you for your willingness to talk to us .
the bureau spoke with anneca oil ,
and the good news is , they want to fix this .
that is good news .
to be honest , i was a little worried .
i mean , who am i ? i &apos;m just a criminal .
i don &apos;t even know enough to know what i want .
i will not be negotiating this deal myself .
i &apos;ve decided to bring in a professional ,
someone to make sure
that the company lawyers don &apos;t eat me for lunch .
mr. denisov , it is my pleasure to be here .
hello .
my name is raymond reddington . and you are ?
i &apos;ve spoken to my agents .
they assure me agent burke is alive .
so , where are we ?
my people are concerned .
they were driven to a village
less than 40 miles from the s.r.u. compound .
they saw the damage being done by the pipeline firsthand .
wait . your people know where the compound is located ?
they don &apos;t know the exact location ,
but based on drive time and the terrain they encountered ,
we think the compound is somewhere
near the southeast base of the zarafshan range .
we can have a black @-@ ops team on the ground tonight .
that would be a mistake .
we don &apos;t know with certainty if agent burke is even there .
i &apos;m willing to take that chance .
and destroy the trust they &apos;re trying to build with denisov
as well as endanger the lives of those still on the ground ?
i agree . at this point , a raid is premature .
agent cooper , i &apos;m assuming your informant
can be of assistance on this one ?
from what i hear , he &apos;s right at the center of this .
then we stay the course for now .
i will see to it
that every one of your interests and expectations
are met or exceeded .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve done one of these .
did i screw up already ?
you &apos;re not really gonna negotiate for denisov , are you ?
you &apos;re the one who insisted
that our interaction be strictly professional .
you gave us this case to help us get the agent back ,
not represent the other side .
agent keen , in this world ,
there are no sides , only players .
are we really supposed to sit here
and hammer out a deal ?
absolutely not .
i was thinking we might get out for a bit .
the first day of negotiation
is rather like the first day of school .
get out ? where ?
let &apos;s go on a field trip , shall we ?
what you &apos;re smelling is benzene ,
a common pollutant in oil production .
it &apos;s in the air we breathe and the food we eat .
this way .
we boil all our water for drinking .
and add andrographis to counteract the toxins .
does that work ?
no .
carcinogens are ingested .
and cause melanomas , damage internal organs ...
lung , liver , and kidney failure .
somewhere , 6,000 miles away ,
a group of bean counters in a boardroom
did a cost @-@ benefit analysis .
and concluded that these people aren &apos;t worth
the cost of responsibly maintaining their pipeline .
the exec i talked to ,
he said your men were sabotaging the pipeline .
said it was a scam .
my youngest brother died of benzene poisoning last year .
so , who &apos;s the hostage here ,
agent burke or these poor devils ?
look , i don &apos;t care what math they did .
no company can ignore this .
it &apos;s bad for business .
only if someone can prove the truth .
anneca spends a fortune on lobbyists
to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
maybe we can contact the state department ,
see if they can apply some pressure ...
try and clean up this mess .
and i can see to it
that agent burke is released unharmed .
see ?
no sides . only players .
keen .
agent keen . i &apos;m glad i caught you .
you know , you &apos;re not an easy woman to reach .
i &apos;m sorry . who is this ?
detective martin wilcox , metro p.d.
assistant director cooper &apos;s office gave me your number .
i hope i caught you at an okay time .
what &apos;s up , detective ?
i &apos;m looking into this missing @-@ persons case .
the vic actually works for the p.d.
it &apos;s a lieutenant ames , d.c. harbormaster .
how can i help ?
i heard that you two ran into each other up on one of the harbor rigs .
it looks like you gave him one of your business cards .
right . right .
i think you said something about the fbi
searching for fugitives out of cumberland .
thing is , i @-@ i &apos;ve made a few calls ,
and nobody seems to know anything about it .
well , that &apos;s because it didn &apos;t happen .
it was a cover .
i couldn &apos;t share why with the lieutenant at the time .
is there any chance you can share it with me now ?
might help me clear this case .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to tell me something .
i mean , you being out there alone ,
drawing your weapon , giving a false story --
it raises some questions .
i &apos;ve already said more than i can say .
may i ask ... lieutenant ames
who reported him missing ?
his wife . married 32 years .
well , i hope you find him , detective .
good luck .
you told ruslan the state department was open
to the idea of an inquiry .
you haven &apos;t touched your baklava .
you told him , and he &apos;s not interested ?
just one bite .
i didn &apos;t come here for the baklava .
i came here to talk about the negotiation .
a russian milonga .
watch closely , lizzy .
everything you need to know about negotiation
is there in the tango milonga .
we &apos;ve got eyes on the s.r.u. compound .
you spoke to commander kushan ?
yes , sir . he understands we want this resolved tonight .
i want full deniability for the agency .
get out in public , far away when this happens .
we &apos;ve been ordered to stand down ,
but local authorities dealing with local issues --
nothing we can do about that .
understood .
at the outset , they are opponents .
each has something the other wants .
they size one another up ,
assessing risk , setting boundaries ,
challenging each other to breach them .
a sensuous battle --
violence and sex ...
balanced on the blade of a knife .
nothing given that is not earned --
nothing taken that is not given .
this is the pure essence of negotiation .
not a poker game , but a milonga .
a tango .
a seduction .
what &apos;s wrong ?
everything .
commander , we have searched all the buildings .
there is no sign of the hostages ,
including the american .
when exactly did this happen ?
last night around 2100 hours .
uzbek special forces are reporting
a full @-@ scale raid of the compound .
it was the cia -- the man in the restaurant ,
he wanted to be seen in public .
what about burke ?
they went this damn far , they better have found him alive .
according to the official report ,
they haven &apos;t found him at all .
it was an all @-@ out assault .
at least a dozen s.r.u. fighters
were killed by an army unit led by --
commander kushan .
how the hell did he know how to find the compound ?
heyworth .
that son of a bitch was ordered to stand down .
who &apos;s on the phone ?
cooper .
harold ! good . i want you to hear this .
reddington , you know this wasn &apos;t our move .
the cia --
the cia did what the cia does .
i expected as much ,
which is why agent burke and the other hostages
were moved from that compound .
the question is
why on earth you would share the compound &apos;s location
with the very people i advised you not to trust .
i &apos;ll deal with heyworth .
oh , heyworth is the least of your troubles now .
i warned you about denisov .
i told you he was violent and unstable .
how do you think he &apos;ll react to losing a dozen of his men ?
you think he &apos;ll kill burke ?
i have no idea .
but now i &apos;m afraid denisov may not trust me ,
and i certainly don &apos;t trust you .
the negotiations are over .
i was stupid to trust you !
ruslan .
i was stupid to think that they respected us
or would deal with us fairly !
take a breath .
i told you to move the hostages . you did .
your assets are intact .
he was left behind at the compound ,
abandoned by his commander .
ruslan , he &apos;s more valuable alive than dead .
not to me .
i hope that made you feel better .
apparently not .
the cia killed you , you understand ?
they did this !
sacrifice the bishop .
reykjavik , &apos; 72 .
god , i can remember it like it was yesterday .
i was in steven bash &apos;s rec room down in the basement ,
eating fried egg and bologna sandwich
when he did it .
did what ? who did ? !
bobby fischer .
it was game 13 , move 50 --
rook takes bishop , b5 .
he sacrificed his bishop .
that &apos;s when russia lost the cold war .
it was staggering .
spassky had no answer because he had no endgame ,
and neither do you .
when you capture and kill a c.e.o. ,
you incur the wrath of a company .
when you capture and kill a cia agent ,
you incur the wrath of the u.s. government .
that &apos;s boots on the ground , drones overhead .
what will be your answer to that ?
my men were murdered .
a message has to be sent .
you &apos;re only seeing the next move .
people have been pillaging your country &apos;s resources
since time began .
someone has to offer a better alternative .
that someone could be you .
ruslan , there is an endgame here that you don &apos;t yet see .
but you see it , don &apos;t you , agent burke ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
denisov here is so blinded by anger ,
he thinks this problem started when he became aware of it .
but you and i both know that &apos;s not true .
why don &apos;t you tell us about zhabin ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
the cia put you here for a reason .
they violated their own policy and federal law
to hide you among locals
because there &apos;s a secret they want to protect .
now tell us about zhabin .
no .
make no mistake , mr. burke .
my friend here is still making
the bed he &apos;ll have to lie in for the rest of his life .
but my bed is made , and i assure you
my bed accommodates a broad spectrum of behavior .
so you tell us what little you know about zhabin ,
or i &apos;ll put you in the ground myself .
give me the gun .
leonid zhabin --
he &apos;s the former cabinet minister ,
part of the old soviet regime .
ran this whole region from the late &apos; 70 th the early &apos; 90s .
a ruthless , corrupt , evil man .
he gave anneca the right to build the pipeline .
and in return , he got a massive kickback
and piece of the ownership interest .
possibly insane , very religious now ,
as if that can save him .
all these sick people are his fault .
maybe he doesn &apos;t like you .
for you , i &apos;m afraid absolution
won &apos;t be quite so easy to obtain .
i need all the details
exactly how the anneca oil rights were sold ,
for how much , including gratuities ,
contingencies , and all the participants .
i want absolution in the next world ,
not a life in prison in this one .
understandable .
but it &apos;s the confession , not the priest ,
that gives us absolution .
the u.s. government says this isn &apos;t torture .
what do you think ?
let me talk , please .
look at yourself .
rich as croesus ,
and you let anneca oil poison your own countrymen .
we didn &apos;t just poison our countrymen .
we killed them , hundreds of them .
looks like we &apos;re hostages now , too .
ressler , i think i &apos;m in trouble .
you think you ...
i got a call from metro p.d.
they &apos;ve got a missing @-@ persons case ,
the d.c. harbormaster .
he showed up where i was holding tom .
whatever you &apos;re about to confess , keen , don &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t kill him . i didn &apos;t .
it was tom .
tom ?
why would tom kill
the one person in a position to rescue him ?
to protect me .
i realize how insane that sounds .
i met the harbormaster the first time he showed up
and gave him my card ,
told him i was there searching for two fugitives .
you lied to him .
to explain why i was there .
i had no idea tom would kill him .
i tried to stop it .
was there witnesses ?
somebody must have been watching tom
while you weren &apos;t there .
there was someone .
thanks for coming down .
look , i don &apos;t think i can help you .
you can &apos;t keep me here .
take it easy . nobody &apos;s keeping you here .
just want to ask you a few questions ,
then you &apos;re free to go .
tell me about elizabeth keen .
where have you been ?
good news .
i &apos;ve reconsidered our position .
negotiations will resume immediately .
did you talk to denisov ?
no questions .
burke &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
no . we have new evidence to present .
there is one proviso , however .
that mouthpiece from anneca , the one you spoke to ?
bring him along .
wait , wait . we can &apos;t leave .
kushan &apos;s doubled the guards outside .
it &apos;s too risky .
i may need to have a chat with this commander kushan .
we &apos;ll come to you . see you in an hour .
we &apos;ve been through this .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
well you are samuel aleko ,
the same samuel aleko who was the custodian
for an abandoned vessel docked in d.c. harbor ,
a rig called the phoenix .
zebra mussels .
yeah , i got to say , sam ,
i &apos;ve seen guys tripped up by a lot of things ,
but zebra mussels ?
yeah , that &apos;s a first .
ah , there it is . yeah , see ?
y @-@ y @-@ you -- you spoke to the shellfish inspector ,
and y @-@ you refused to let him board ,
and you promised to vacate the slip .
see ?
i know you were there .
you gentleman are doing a wonderful job .
sorry . sorry . traffic coming into the city .
price of progress .
this is dean walker from anneca .
who &apos;s this ?
the smoking gun .
that sounded dramatic .
leonid zhabin .
this is the new evidence that you were talking about .
ex @-@ minister zhabin hasn &apos;t been in power for 20 years ,
and with all due respect , sir , the man is not mentally well .
perhaps not ,
but &quot; in a mad world , only the mad are sane . &quot;
kurosawa .
what the hell is he talking about ?
history , mr. walker .
my new friend knows a great deal
about the history of your company &apos;s pipeline .
history is not new evidence .
or maybe it is .
as it turns out , we do agree on one key detail .
your company &apos;s current pipeline
is not the worst thing on earth .
then what is ?
the first pipeline -- the one anneca built in 1988,
four years before the current one .
is that what he told you ? the man is delusional .
probably .
there was only one pipeline .
we broke ground to build it in &apos; 92 .
read the contracts .
you &apos;re right . the contracts do say that .
it started before the wall fell .
uzbekistan was still
a constituent republic of the soviet union .
mr. gorbachev was changing our future .
i was allowed to secretly open our markets
for an american pipeline .
this is fiction .
i sold the rights to them that year ,
and they built the first pipeline right away .
you couldn &apos;t even wait to do it right !
we were all so greedy .
the first line was an unmitigated disaster .
hundreds were killed .
whole villages became ill .
i still see their faces .
then the soviet union collapsed , and all hell broke loose .
anneca paid mr. zhabin to orchestrate a cover @-@ up .
bury the dead ,
destroy any record that the first pipeline ever existed .
it wasn &apos;t the only disaster
cloaked by those momentous events ,
hidden from view in the fog of a new world order .
it &apos;s a good story .
but that &apos;s all it is -- a story from a crazy old man .
who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents
in the hope that , one day ,
he might find the courage to set things right .
you engineers did better the second time around .
at least this one took 20 years to start leaking .
if this is true
and anneca is responsible for hundreds of people &apos;s deaths ,
then you and the other high @-@ level executives will be prosecuted .
reparations can be paid to the alleged victims .
we can fix this .
reparations are all well and good ,
but the people i represent don &apos;t want you to fix it .
they don &apos;t ?
no .
the uzbek people
have had quite enough of anneca &apos;s promises .
they want you to leave .
pack up your pipeline and leave .
that won &apos;t happen .
mr. denisov thought you might need some additional incentive ,
so mr. zhabin was kind enough to direct him
to one of the mass graves
where victims of the first pipeline are buried .
his men are on their way there now .
i can stop them if we have a deal .
can i get some water , please ?
oh ! yes ! of course .
this is the water they drink in the villages ,
the ones directly above your pipeline .
drink up .
talk to your board .
you have 24 hours until we go public .
effective immediately , anneca oil has elected
to cease operation of its local pipeline .
and we are thrilled to announce
some exciting and highly profitable
new initiatives on the horizon .
we got to go .
s.r.u. just confirmed -- agent burke &apos;s being released .
where ?
drop point outside the city .
... construction of three new schools
for the people of this great country .
thank you .
and now i &apos;ll take a few questions .
commander kushan .
it &apos;s good to meet you .
i &apos;ve heard nothing but terrible things .
what kind of deal are we talking about ?
it all depends on what you got to say ,
how valuable it is to the case .
i can take you to the body .
is that valuable enough ?
they should be here any time now .
director heyworth , the agents are on site .
please advise .
do not move until they take possession of the asset .
s.o.g. team is standing by in the perimeter ,
awaiting your go .
once the exchange is complete ,
i want reddington taken into custody .
if denisov shows , kill him .
car &apos;s arriving now , sir .
team leader , stand by .
can you confirm reddington is in the vehicle ?
affirmative .
agent burke . welcome back .
we have eyes on target .
reddington &apos;s out of the car , sir .
nobody moves until i give the order .
hey , arnold .
sir , i tried to stop him .
you and i have a problem .
take a step back , harold .
you ignored a justice department directive .
you told kushan how to find that compound .
you can &apos;t prove that .
you and i both know
my people are there to protect an asset of yours .
i can neither confirm nor deny .
if anything happens
to those agents ,
the next time your phone rings ,
it &apos;ll be the attorney general calling .
sir , standing by for your order .
sir , our window &apos;s closing .
requesting authorization to take immediate action .
stand down .
i need your help .
commander kushan and his men are at my compound .
his men are .
if you can get me out of the country --
i can .
but i won &apos;t .
they will arrest me .
perhaps .
sooner or later , we all must pay for our crimes .
is kushan ...
you still don &apos;t see it , do you ?
the endgame .
you could run this country , ruslan .
what you &apos;ve done is that important .
you brought a multinational corporation to its knees ,
saved countless lives .
you &apos;ll make this country billions .
you may go to prison for a bit .
but you will emerge a hero .
one of the few standing in your way
is commander kushan .
well , not standing .
commander kushan ?
more on this breaking story .
just hours after anneca oil &apos;s announcement
that the company is shutting down its pipeline
comes this surprising development .
the government and french oil conglomerate savillion
have reached a deal
to nationalize a brand @-@ new pipeline .
the deal , said to be worth billions ,
should gain easy approval
and will be finalized within days .
i never saw it coming .
i knew you had to have an angle .
elizabeth keen , this is claude hippeau ,
senior vice president of savillion .
enchantée .
you were having drinks together the day we arrived .
you knew exactly what was gonna happen .
i had an inkling .
au revoir , mon ami .
give my regards to the wife -- and the mistress .
that &apos;s why you wanted anneca to abandon the pipeline ,
to clear the way for another company to get the contract ?
you say that as if it &apos;s a bad thing .
anneca shuts down operations ,
the victims are well compensated ,
maybe get a little justice ,
a new firm is poised to deliver
a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pipeline -- everybody wins .
you get a payday from savillion for making it happen .
vive la france .
did you find anything ?
no .
i mean , uh , yes .
looks like some kind of beta technology .
a recording device .
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s late &apos; 80s , early &apos; 90s .
but how it works , what it does ...
i don &apos;t have the faintest idea .
have you spoken to mr. reddington about this ?
no .
but he might have some insights .
you have to tell me -- promise me
you will not talk to reddington about this .
mum &apos;s the word .
we got a deal , right ?
no jail time if i testify ?
you &apos;re not gonna believe
what i have to say .
tell me about elizabeth keen .
