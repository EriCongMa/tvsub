第七季 第一集
sheldon , it &apos;s not a great time !
what do you want ?
hello to you , too .
i &apos;m sorry , but this is important .
what is it ?
back to the future ii was
in the back to the future iii case ...
and back to the future iii was-- get this--
in the back to the future ii case .
so ?
so , did you do that ,
or am i in the house with an intruder ?
sheldon , i got to go inside .
it &apos;s getting rough out here .
you &apos;re dodging the question ;
i knew it was you .
what was that ?
what was what ?
this isn &apos;t a very good connection ,
but it sounded like someone just released a kraken .
okay , i &apos;m hanging up now .
you know there &apos;s no such thing as a ...
no ... !
penny ... penny ...
penny ... !
what &apos;s the matter ?
um ... well , i was worried
that you might be missing leonard .
and that might be causing you to have bad dreams ,
like the kind you &apos;d get if you watched
clash of the titans right before you went to bed .
sweetie , did you have a bad dream ?
to be honest , i did .
back to the future ii was
in the back to the future iii case .
leonard did it .
good night .
no , wait .
perhaps i should sleep here
so you don &apos;t miss leonard as much ,
uh , &apos; cause you &apos;re being kind of a baby about it .
you know what ? that would make me feel better .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
good night .
i think you &apos;d be pleased to hear
that this morning in the parking garage ,
i saw this oil stain on the ground
that was shaped just like my ex @-@ girlfriend , lucy ,
and i didn &apos;t get upset at all .
i &apos;m proud of you .
well , you should be , &apos; cause she was looking good .
dear lord ! you &apos;re an astronomer .
although you may have earthly woes ,
get your mind back on the stars .
gee , even the lowly dung beetle
chooses to plot its course by using the milky way .
is that true ?
everything i say is true .
now , of course , the dung beetle also enjoys
eating feces , living in feces
and making little balls out of feces .
so pick and choose
which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace .
come on , you can talk to girls now .
it shouldn &apos;t be hard for you to meet someone new .
how can i meet someone new
when everywhere i look , i see lucy &apos;s face ?
tell me you don &apos;t see her smile
in the crust of this chicken pot pie .
oh , will you stop it !
now , listen to me .
there &apos;s a welcome party for incoming post @-@ docs tonight .
go to it and meet someone
who isn &apos;t made of grease or pie .
you think you &apos;re so cool because your wife is a person ?
look ,
bernie &apos;s at a neuroscience conference with amy--
i &apos;ll go with you .
you would do that for me ?
of course .
you &apos;re my friend .
i want you to be happy .
thanks .
oh , sheldon ,
since amy &apos;s out of town , would you like to join us ?
i want you to be happy , too ,
but not enough to do anything about it .
howie , stop .
i can &apos;t talk like that .
amy &apos;s right here .
sheldon , stop . for the last time ,
i will not bring home bed bugs .
the hotel &apos;s nice .
there &apos;s a pool , a gym--
the bar looks like fun .
because i looked in the bed , and there are no bugs .
aw , i love you , too .
if i don &apos;t talk to you before you go to sleep ,
i &apos;ll meet you in dreamland .
good night .
no , i will not consider sleeping in my garment bag .
penny , did you ever wonder how starfleet captains ...
no .
well , now that i &apos;ve piqued your interest ,
welcome to the exciting world of 3d chess .
why don &apos;t you just admit
you only want to play this game
because you always play it with leonard
and you miss him ?
you overestimate his significance in my life .
do i miss how he makes a face
on my toaster waffle with syrup ?
no .
do i miss the way
he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck ?
i don &apos;t think so .
do i miss how we say &quot; good night &quot;
to each other through the walls of our bedroom
using morse code ?
okay , i get it , i get it .
you are an emotionless robot .
well , i try .
all right , let &apos;s just get this stupid game over with .
great . i &apos;ll go first .
okay .
by the way , how are you with zippers ?
why ?
well , i really need to go to the bathroom ,
and this one &apos;s gone all cattywampus .
wow , your work on jellyfish neural nets
sounds so interesting .
it is .
you can download my paper off the university server .
i will . you can download my paper
on the van allen belts from the university server as well .
i will .
all right .
how &apos;d it go ?
well , if you like dry , factual statements
interspersed with painful moments of silence ,
it was bananas .
check it out .
mrs. davis from human resources is here .
she &apos;s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment .
oh , great .
there go my chances of being sexually harassed .
i heard her husband left her for a hot , young undergrad .
that &apos;s so much better than the old , ugly ones .
mr. wolowitz ,
dr. koothrappali .
mrs. davis , nice to see you .
you know , i recently read a fascinating article
on infidelity among penguins .
okay .
so if the fact that your husband left you
makes you feel unattractive , just remember ,
penguins get cheated on , and they &apos;re adorable .
it was better when you couldn &apos;t talk to women .
i was thinking of going to the lecture
on posterior cingulate cortex lesions
in the formation of autobiographical memory .
oh , brain lesions are fascinating .
unless they &apos;re yours , then they &apos;re a drag .
to the advancement of science .
and to the sick and dying who make it possible .
this is fun ; we never really get to talk shop
with penny around .
we usually just end up talking about boys .
which is fine , but it &apos;s nice to mix it up
with a little intellectual conversation .
from the two gentlemen at the bar .
oh , my gosh , boys bought us drinks !
boys bought us drinks !
thank you , thank you , thank you so much .
be cool .
you be cool !
guys are hitting on us , and not just to get to penny .
you &apos;re right .
thank you .
bad move .
really ? why ?
my queen can now take your rook from below .
so that means i lose , right ?
it &apos;s over !
if i make this move ...
but i won &apos;t because we &apos;re having too much fun .
okay , let &apos;s take a break .
we &apos;re all out of alcohol .
i wasn &apos;t going to get alcohol .
gosh , i wonder what leonard &apos;s doing right now .
i miss him so much .
well , if you &apos;d like ,
we could call him .
i @-@ i mean that you could call him .
as i &apos;ve explained ,
the absence of my friends does not cause me pain .
as rock and roll bad boy , paul simon , once said ,
&quot; i am a rock .
i am an i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ island . &quot;
i &apos;m calling him .
oh , goodie ! put him on speakerphone !
excuse me , ladies ,
but my pants are buzzing .
north sea , how can i &quot; kelp &quot; you ?
leonard ?
penny ?
hey , it &apos;s penny .
everybody say hi to penny .
hi , penny !
wow , it sounds like you &apos;re having a good time .
best time of my life !
isn &apos;t it 5 : 30 in the morning there ?
is it ?
hey , everybody , it &apos;s 5 : 30 in the morning !
okay , well , we were just calling you
because we were missing you .
iceberg !
uh @-@ oh , hang on .
are you in danger ?
no , it &apos;s a drinking game .
whenever we see an iceberg , we take a shot !
berg ! berg !
berg ! berg ! berg ! berg--
leonard , leonard ?
i cannot believe we were missing that jerk .
you were .
so what happened ? how &apos;d it go ?
it &apos;s fine . i thanked them again
and let them know we &apos;re not available .
so i can drink this without having
to give up the goodies ?
yes , it &apos;s all cool .
although , if you wanted to talk to one of them ,
no one would blame you .
and why would no one blame me ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .
well , it sounds like you &apos;re saying
that i could do better than sheldon .
boy , these drinks are strong !
hoo , mama , i &apos;m gonna be hug in the toilet tonight !
no , tell me ,
i want to know what you meant by that .
i just meant that you &apos;re not married
and your boyfriend &apos;s kind of ...
sheldon .
and your husband is extremely howard .
what &apos;s your point ?
sorry . i have no point .
that was a stupid thing to say .
can we please just go back to having a nice time ?
we could , but unfortunately my brain is lesion @-@ free
and i remember that rotten thing
you just said about my sweet baboo .
come on . i apologize .
can we please just let it go ?
sure .
thanks .
your husband &apos;s weird and his clothes are ridiculous .
i can &apos;t believe it !
all this time i &apos;ve been doing nothing
but sit around and miss that guy .
and you know what the worst part is ?
that you &apos;re having to process
your emotional pain without vodka ?
no .
yes .
but you know what the second @-@ worst part is ?
he does not miss me at all .
allow me to comfort you .
at least you &apos;ve got your health .
really ? tha @-@ that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s comforting ?
um , uh , in a hundred years ,
you &apos;ll both be dead and it won &apos;t matter ?
no ! come on !
you &apos;re supposed to say , &quot; of course he misses you .
the only reason he &apos;s partying is to cover up his pain . &quot;
oh , no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true at all .
this is ridiculous .
why am i upset just because he &apos;s off having a good time ?
well ... perhaps you &apos;re obsessively picturing him
engaged in drunken coitus with another woman .
is that it ? did i get it right ?
okay , tha @-@ that &apos;s great .
you can stop trying to make me feel better now .
actually , i can &apos;t .
before leonard left ,
he made me promise that i &apos;d take care of you .
he did ?
yes .
oh , that &apos;s really sweet .
plus , if i do a good job ,
he said he &apos;d bring me back a sailor &apos;s cap .
now i miss him even more .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i &apos;m sure leonard &apos;s tormented every moment
he &apos;s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips .
thanks .
oh , seriously ?
uh , excuse me , mrs. davis ?
what ?
i &apos;d like to apologize for being insensitive .
and for possibly making penguins seem like jerks ,
&apos;cause 99 % of them are stand @-@ up guys .
forget about it .
you know , you @-@ you and i ,
you and i have a lot in common .
is that right ?
oh , yes , i @-@ i , too ,
am in the throes of heartbreak .
okay , fine , i &apos;ll tell you about it .
here is a hot beverage to comfort you .
it &apos;s in a to @-@ go cup .
make of that what you will .
come on . it &apos;s still early .
let &apos;s do something .
well , i have been toying around with an idea for 4 @-@ d chess .
how about we just talk ?
all right .
in 4 @-@ d chess ...
no .
come on , let &apos;s talk about our lives .
tell me something about you i don &apos;t know .
i own nine pairs of pants .
okay , that @-@ that &apos;s a good start ,
but i was thinking maybe something a little more personal .
i see .
i own nine pairs of underpants .
how about i go first ?
but i don &apos;t want to know how many underpants you own .
although , based on the floor of your bedroom ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s a thousand .
okay , look , here &apos;s something people do not know about me .
when i first moved out to l.a. ,
i did a topless scene in a low @-@ budget horror movie
about a killer gorilla .
after i did it , i felt so ashamed .
thankfully , that thing never came out .
i &apos;ve seen that .
yeah . serial apeist .
howard found it online the day we met you .
oh , god ...
and it was literally the moment you walked out the door .
but i see the type of personal revelations you &apos;re going for .
okay , here &apos;s one i thought i &apos;d take to the grave .
a while back ,
youtube changed its user interface
from a star @-@ based rating system
to a thumbs @-@ up rating system .
i tell people i &apos;m okay with it ,
but i &apos;m really not .
that &apos;s your big revelation ?
yes .
i feel ten pounds lighter .
okay , you know what ?
i give up .
i &apos;m going to bed .
here &apos;s something else you don &apos;t know about me :
you just hurt my feelings .
what did i do ?
i opened up and shared something
deeply upsetting to me ,
and you treated it as if it were nothing .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t think it was a big deal .
it is to me ; that &apos;s the point .
sheldon , you are right .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i should &apos;ve known better .
your apology is accepted .
thank you .
how about a hug ?
how about a hearty handshake ?
come on .
now i know how you felt getting mauled
by that sex @-@ crazed gorilla .
good night .
it was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks .
yeah , that felt nice .
maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants
and see if we can score us some free omelets .
so , hypothetically , if @-@ if we were to have gone with them ,
which one would you have picked ?
i think i would have gone with
the short one with the goofy haircut .
oh , good , &apos; cause i liked the tall thin one .
he seemed intelligent , kind of a loner ,
maybe a little sexually inexperienced ,
like i &apos;d have to teach him a thing or two .
not my guy .
i caught him staring at my rack .
it &apos;d be nice to be with a man
who wants to know what &apos;s underneath my cardigan .
fyi , it &apos;s another cardigan .
your short sexed @-@ up guy kind of sounds like howard .
your brainy virgin kind of sounds like sheldon .
good night .
night .
all right , dr. koothrappali ,
it &apos;s been nice talking to you ,
but i need to go home and relieve my babysitter .
yeah , i can relate to being a single parent .
i have a dog .
yeah , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
good night .
mrs. davis ...
i , uh , i must confess ,
i came here tonight in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc ,
but instead i got to connect with you at a human level .
that &apos;s a much better evening .
you &apos;re a lovely person .
are you hitting on me ?
no , no , no , that would be crazy !
i mean , if i were hitting on you , you &apos;d know it
&apos;cause you &apos;d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me .
you &apos;re sweet .
good night , dr. koothrappali .
good night .
looks like she accepted your apology .
and then some .
i think we had a moment .
oh , please , you did not have a moment .
who died and made you king of moments ?
okay , fine . let &apos;s say there was a moment .
there was .
there wasn &apos;t .
but ... but even if there was ,
what are you gonna do about it ?
i will slowly seduce her
until she falls helpless into my bed ,
hungry for the pleasure only i can give her .
so nothing .
no , not a thing .
i &apos;m so glad the police finally caught
that psychotic genetically engineered ape .
that is my girlfriend ! i swear to god !
leonard ! leonard ! leonard ! leonard !
