hey , i &apos;m sleeping at deke &apos;s house tonight .
wink , wink , winky @-@ wink .
deke &apos;s house ? you mean your boyfriend &apos;s dumpster ?
yeah . so i need a , uh--
tetanus shot ?
higher standards ?
no , a condom .
i &apos;m about to have sex , and i want it to feel bad .
i should have one in my purse from the last time i had sex .
they had purses the last time you had sex ?
no , we carried animal hides tied with sticks .
it hasn &apos;t been that long .
oh , here &apos;s one next to this movie ticket stub from precious .
okay , it &apos;s been that long .
心中有着小幻想却又被无情现实打击的故事
you saw precious without a condom ?
it says , &quot; best if used before september 2012 . &quot;
just like the milk here .
i wish i knew a guy with a condom .
a man , any man .
oleg , do you happen to have--
okay , this should get you through the night .
but if it doesn &apos;t , you can use this freezer bag
and a rubber band .
max , i laid out the little cups ,
so all you have to do is fill them with cole slaw .
said the girl who was on the forbes
&quot; top ten to watch &quot; list .
i can &apos;t do my side work tonight .
normally i &apos;d say it &apos;s because i &apos;m drunk ,
but tonight it &apos;s because my back hurts and i &apos;m drunk .
here , babe , i got you something
that might help your back feel better .
a breast reduction ?
no !
why would you spit in the face of god ?
everybody , calm down .
those aren &apos;t going anywhere .
and if they are , i am going with them .
i got some cooling patches to soothe her muscles .
and when that doesn &apos;t work ,
i have another brand called &quot; maui wowie . &quot;
pickup .
i &apos;ll see you later . love you .
love you .
deke , breath . what is that ?
teriyaki beef jerky . why , is it bad ?
no . give me another hit .
that is delicious .
you know it .
max , since you guys are getting serious ,
why not go on the pill ,
so every night you won &apos;t have to play
&quot; what can we turn into a condom ? &quot;
the pill is , like , 50 bucks a month .
that &apos;s more than it costs to raise a damn baby .
well , your boyfriend &apos;s rich . he can afford to pay for it .
great , now i &apos;m a white trash mom .
uh @-@ uh , no way .
i &apos;m saving deke &apos;s fortune for more important things ,
like doritos dinamita .
pretty much the filet mignon of corn chips .
i mean , i &apos;d be on the pill right now ,
but the one man interested in me is married ,
so i guess that &apos;s more of a bitter pill .
seriously , max . think about it .
fine .
why don &apos;t guys have to take the pill ?
we have to take all the pills . birth control , midol , roofies ...
bonjour , caroline .
chef nicolas . what are you doing in the diner ?
oh , no , i never wanted you to see me wearing this .
yeah , so be a gentleman and take a step back ,
&apos;cause as bad as it looks , it smells worse .
i think you look beautiful .
your wife looks beautiful .
oh , yeah . get it , girl .
may i see you alone over there in the , uh ...
i guess one would call it a restaurant ?
but just for a minute . i &apos;m working .
what &apos;s that smell ?
that &apos;s today &apos;s special . beef pot pie .
oh , it doesn &apos;t smell like beef .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s not beef ,
it &apos;s not made today , and it &apos;s not special .
listen , caroline .
we have all this relationship drama ,
and we &apos;re not even in a relationship .
please get to know me better .
come to my home for dinner .
dinner at your home , just you and me ?
how do you think your wife would feel about that ?
we have an open relationship .
did you think i &apos;m the type of man
who would have sex with another woman
without asking my wife ?
that is so american .
max ?
why are you calling max ?
i want to make sure i haven &apos;t lost my mind .
nicolas said he told his wife about me ,
and she gave him permission for us to sleep together .
ha ! good one !
my boss at quiznos once told me his wife &apos;s dying wish
was that i let him motorboat me .
okay , so she may have been motorboated out of quiznos .
but i am not falling for this .
yes , i thought you wouldn &apos;t believe me ,
so i set up a skype call with her from france on friday .
wait , you want me to skype with your wife about sex ?
am i on dr. phil ?
hey , everybody .
i got a new dress , and it &apos;s bitchin &apos; .
hey , look at him . oh .
nobody told me they added beefcake to the menu .
excuse me , beefcake has been on the menu
since i started working here .
finally ...
there &apos;s somebody in the diner as good @-@ looking as me .
hi , i &apos;m sophie kuchenski .
nicolas saintcroix .
and he &apos;s french too ?
oh , come on !
i &apos;m sorry , i was in the middle of a conversation with caroline .
who ?
me , the one whose feet you &apos;re standing on .
oh , wait a minute .
is this the married guy ?
oh , girl !
i &apos;m gonna give you two days &apos; head start , and then he &apos;s mine !
why do you care what his wife thinks about your hair ?
you &apos;re not gonna be sleeping with her .
although you &apos;d be a lot more interesting if you did .
i &apos;m not gonna be sleeping with him either .
and when i tell his wife that , i want to look good doing it .
i have to look 20 % better than her .
and since skype makes you look 20 % worse ,
i have to look 40 % better than i do now .
you realize talking about math in a hair salon
is my worst nightmare , right ?
welcome to the tristan evans salon .
hi , hello . we &apos;re here for the ... student haircut .
i &apos;m sorry ?
the $ 6 haircuts for poor people
from the people who don &apos;t really know how to cut hair yet .
max , that &apos;s not true . this is the tristan evans salon .
i &apos;m sure that everyone that &apos;s enrolled here is a genius .
at least tell me they &apos;re gay .
just have a seat over there .
i &apos;ll have somebody come up from the hair school and-- shh !
so loud .
hair school . got it .
we &apos;ll just take a seat over there till they arrive .
girl , you just sit there , relax ,
and let jameis make this head major .
so weird , &apos; cause i majored in head .
girl , you are all everything .
that &apos;s a little cold .
i &apos;m sorry , what was your name again ?
dan .
uh @-@ huh . dan ? so just dan ?
you &apos;re not , like , a danny or a dantrell ?
dan .
i need to get conditioner .
damn it , max , i got a straight one .
what makes you think he &apos;s straight ?
he keeps pushing my head down before i &apos;m ready .
is the water too warm ?
why ? are my pants too wet ?
把他的手放入温水中 会害他尿床
girl , are we in love ?
max , i need you to give me your gay .
yeah , right .
i &apos;d give you my left nut before i give you my gay .
you weren &apos;t even gonna get your hair done .
yeah , but i always wanted to know
what it felt like to get a shampoo
without a school nurse running that tiny comb through my hair .
dan ?
i have a magazine over there
with a photo of a chic , piece @-@ y , choppy bob .
you can do that , right ?
sure .
piece of bob . got it .
&apos;sup ?
dan , dan , dan !
okay , done . you &apos;re ready to cut .
let &apos;s go . i can &apos;t risk some discount hetero cutting my hair .
i &apos;ll see you at home . i &apos;m pretty close to a hairgasm .
that should &apos;ve been mine .
i haven &apos;t had a hairgasm in years .
she hasn &apos;t had any gasm in years .
oh , my god !
max , is that hair your new form of birth control ?
you look like dame edna .
男扮女装而成的谐星歌舞老太婆
that &apos;s what i asked for !
hellooo !
now my outside matches my inside
because i &apos;ve always been an old drag queen
trapped inside the body of a young black girl .
hellooo !
oh , hi , max .
oh , i used to wear my hair like that .
i used it to smuggle cheese and cigarettes into the prison .
oh , hey , caroline .
just checking .
still not sleeping with that french guy
that i &apos;m sleeping with ?
still not , sophie . he &apos;s married .
well , good .
&apos;cause i &apos;m here to talk to that wife
and throw my hoo @-@ ha into the ring .
i even bought myself a flat french hat
to make me more french .
yeah , i got me the hat
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t have time to grow out my pits .
okay , the call is in one minute . i &apos;ll just do it from here .
i was planning to be holding my louis vuitton shopping bag ,
but the cat took a dump in it .
and , max , bring that lamp closer to my face ,
so i don &apos;t have eight skype chins .
fine , but if i get too close to the bulb ,
my hair might blow up .
here she is .
sophie , good @-@ bye .
oh , no , i &apos;m not leaving , baby .
that french hottie and i are perfect for each other .
i mean , look at me .
i &apos;m wearing a beret . i have a baguette .
bonjour , bitches !
okay , take a deep breath , and remember , this is ridiculous .
bonjour , caroline .
bonjour . you must be juliette .
it is nice to meet you .
and you as well , juliette .
i just want to set the record straight about nicolas and i.
i am not the type of--
yes , you have my permission to sleep with nicolas .
au revoir .
that &apos;s it ? she &apos;s gone ?
i didn &apos;t even get to say &quot; hos before bros &quot; in french .
so much more to say .
what more is there to say ?
she said we could sleep with him .
no , i &apos;m never sleeping with nicolas ,
no matter what his wife says .
good , &apos; cause you could never share a french guy .
you won &apos;t even share your french toast .
thanks for coming .
i promise , just one drink at nicolas &apos;s ,
and then we &apos;ll go to the movies .
and , max , i can &apos;t believe you went out with that hair in public .
i like it .
you look like my aunt esther , but not as hot .
麦克斯与其发型相像
oh , caroline .
i see you brought deke and ...
max &apos;s mother ?
the only thing this hair and my mother have in common is
they &apos;re both high .
nicolas , i &apos;m not staying .
i know you went to a lot of trouble with dinner ,
so i didn &apos;t want to be rude ,
but we can only stay for one drink .
god , you look beautiful .
maybe two drinks .
but definitely no dinner .
well , that dinner we weren &apos;t staying for was delicious .
yeah , we should not stay more often .
i like your loft , man .
it &apos;s the perfect place to live
if you like to commit really sexy crimes .
well , we should go .
no . you &apos;re not staying for dessert ?
you &apos;re breaking my heart .
well , maybe just one piece . we can share it .
i thought you didn &apos;t want to share .
he &apos;s not married to his dessert , max ,
and it &apos;s just one piece .
we &apos;re here , so he doesn &apos;t get a piece .
you got a pretty sweet setup for a married man who &apos;s single .
creme caramel au coconut cake .
well , it &apos;s no fudgie the whale .
thanks .
i love to cook for friends .
beautiful friends .
nicolas , just because your wife gave me permission
does not mean i &apos;m gonna let you take me over
to that king @-@ size bed with
what looks like really good sheets
and make love to me all night long .
and then again that morning .
so how &apos;s your back , esther ?
oh , morty .
i have to tell you something .
is it your heart ?
no , i &apos;m on the pill .
i know . you &apos;re on a lot of pills .
no , a pill @-@ pill .
the pill @-@ pill @-@ pill ?
yeah , see ?
you just pop &apos; em out one at a time .
they &apos;re like pez for sluts .
speaking of sluts ...
oh , boy , this is awkward .
and i &apos;ve testified against half my family .
i agree , max .
things are a little uncomfortable .
so why don &apos;t we just make this as weird as possible ?
damn it , i knew he was gonna kill us .
tango , anyone ?
honestly , i prefer if you kill us .
okay , well , we gotta go , esther .
no , morty , sit down ! i &apos;m not missing the show .
it comes with dinner .
tango ? nicolas , you cannot be serious .
oh , maybe you cannot dance , caroline ?
can &apos;t dance ?
one summer , i taught ballroom dance to homeless teens .
because when you &apos;re dancing , you &apos;re not hungry ?
fast @-@ forward .
this is my least favorite part of the addams family .
剧中家人常有跳舞桥段
look at his pants .
i know .
that tango is giving him even less ball room .
stay . we don &apos;t have to have sex .
we don &apos;t ?
i promise .
i have to go to the restroom , max . so do you .
come in , come in , come in , come in , come in .
okay , where &apos;s the coke ?
there is no coke .
why would you call anyone into a bathroom if you don &apos;t have coke ?
that &apos;s rude .
no , i was just gonna talk to you .
oh , then i &apos;m definitely gonna need coke .
okay , look . you are not sleeping with him .
of course not .
but tonight i &apos;m thinking there &apos;s something special here .
i mean , we talked , and we laughed .
if you guys are doing blow in here without me ,
i &apos;m gonna be so pissed .
i wish .
no , caroline wants to have sex with nicolas .
even after that tango ?
listen , now i &apos;m thinking i want to sleep over ,
but not have sex .
is that where he puts it in but doesn &apos;t move it around ?
that &apos;s what i do when you &apos;re passed out .
that &apos;s what i do when you &apos;re passed out .
look , nothing is going in anywhere .
i just want to get to know him better .
you really think you can sleep in his bed with him
and not use his penis as a body pillow ?
of course .
i &apos;ve done that with every boy on the upper east side .
that &apos;s why they called me the east side snuggler .
and trust me ,
even though his wife begged me to have sex with him ,
i &apos;m not going to .
but didn &apos;t you tell us the whole reason you dragged us here
was because you were afraid of being alone with him ?
look , i get it .
and if you two really don &apos;t think i &apos;m capable
of not having sex with him ,
then hang out for a bit until you &apos;re sure that i &apos;m fine .
fine , but we are not staying all night .
here are some blankets for you , max and deke .
you can take the couch .
caroline and i will take the bed .
once again , our apologies .
we are just too drunk to go .
too drunk !
you did share that one glass of wine .
yup , we are too drunk .
so too drunk to walk ?
well , i don &apos;t know . you be the judge .
i am so sorry about this .
it &apos;s fine , caroline .
i know what &apos;s going on here .
oh , and , nicolas , before you go ,
i just wanted to say thanks again for the drinks ,
the dinner ,
the dessert ,
my pillow ,
and deke &apos;s pillow .
we get it , grandma . good night .
we &apos;ll be right over there .
and i &apos;ll be right over here .
good night , sleep tight ,
don &apos;t let the bedbugs have sex with you .
uh , you and i are gonna do it , right ?
oh , yeah . think i took my pill this morning .
either that or i didn &apos;t take my pill .
wow , max , this is a big step
that you may or may not have taken today .
you know if it &apos;s too much trouble ,
we don &apos;t have to go off condoms .
so you &apos;re the one guy in the world
who wants to still wear a condom ?
do you have something ?
no , it &apos;s not like that .
i &apos;m just saying the pill is a big commitment .
oh , so do you not want to take this step ?
because i already went to planned parenthood ,
and i never plan anything .
max , i guess i &apos;m just surprised--
hold that thought .
i hear nothing .
so ?
so that &apos;s what caroline sounds like during sex !
keep talking like i &apos;m here .
ah , oh , yeah , baby !
right there ! that &apos;s the spot !
yeah , now slap my face with &apos; em !
well , if you were still here , that &apos;s what i &apos;d be saying .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ll switch it up .
uh , go fish , max .
max , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re fine .
we &apos;re just lying here talking .
no , we &apos;re not . i &apos;m really turned on .
why ? what &apos;s he doing to you ?
it &apos;s not him , it &apos;s me . i &apos;m the predator here .
you were right . you better stop me .
get up here with us .
i &apos;m not getting in bed with you .
max , get in the bed .
i know a jaques @-@ block when i see one .
i am so sorry .
this is silly . i know it must be hard for you .
uh , not anymore .
you know , last night when you and i were in bed ,
i realized i guess nicolas is just gonna be one of
those people in my life that i &apos;m always gonna
almost have sex with , but i never will .
you know ?
yeah , like me and you .
hey , deke .
hey , earl .
best conversation i had today .
max , last night i got the idea that maybe you thought
that i didn &apos;t want to take our relationship to the next level .
and just to prove that i do want to go to the next level ,
i got you a ring .
oh , my god , max ! i &apos;m so happy for you !
even though i thought i &apos;d be the first one to get engaged .
i think we all thought that .
deke , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re gonna pull out of your pocket ,
but it better be a gun .
actually , i know you don &apos;t want a ring @-@ ring .
but how about a nuvaring ?
a nuvaring ?
how did you know my size ?
i can &apos;t wait to try it on .
well , i am not throwing you a shower for that .
after i saw how you maybe forgot to take your pill on day one
and then took pills all day just to be safe ,
i thought you &apos;d need a little help .
so there , max . will you not have children with me ?
you &apos;re damn right i won &apos;t .
oh , wait , i think these take a couple days to work .
where are we gonna get a condom for tonight ?
