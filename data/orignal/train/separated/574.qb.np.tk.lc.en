hey , buzzby , how are you today ?
not so great , bumbleton .
i have a ton of pollen to collect ,
but i &apos;m really tired .
flying a little low ? maybe you should get high .
who &apos;s this ?
this is drugs .
aren &apos;t drugs bad ?
no way .
drugs are like special honey . they give you a buzzzzz .
don &apos;t call me honey , honey .
pierce !
drugs doesn &apos;t say that .
i don &apos;t say anything , by the way .
i mean , i thought this show was about drug awareness .
who &apos;s gonna be aware of a character that has no lines ?
and also i noticed on page 15 i get flushed down the toilet .
consider yourself lucky .
annie , question . is pierce marijuana ?
and does marijuana help people work faster ?
i thought it made them just custom @-@ paint their vans
and solve mysteries .
also , are you sure that my costume is on backwards ?
somehow i felt more confident before .
i have a question . i don &apos;t think my character
would say &quot; tripping balls . &quot;
that &apos;s not a question .
i don &apos;t think my character would say tripping balls , okay ?
guys , let &apos;s remember why we &apos;re doing this .
if our work helps even one kid make better choices ,
then it will all be worth it .
i wish i had seen a show like this when i was younger .
it might have helped me avoid my mistakes .
well , we &apos;re happy to do this for you , annie ,
but i have to say , my school had plenty of shows like this ,
and i think sitting through them drove me to drugs .
you don &apos;t count , britta .
you don &apos;t respond to anything appropriately .
thank you !
dean @-@ dong !
i &apos;m just checking in to see
how the greendale antidrug players are doing .
now , i talked to the guidance counselor at the san ramone middle school ,
and there &apos;s gonna be at least 50
little at @-@ risk rug rats coming here tomorrow for your big world premiere .
that is terrific .
so with any luck , we can get rid of all those charleston chews
in the vending machines .
um , dean pelton , were you hoping to participate
in the show ?
oh , i would love to , annie .
but as you can see from my outfit ,
i already have plans , so off to the airport ramada !
how come he gets a front stinger ?
第二季 第十三集
do you think bees eat their own honey ?
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ve at least tasted it .
this guy keeps texting me .
you don &apos;t like him ?
i don &apos;t like flirting in text .
that &apos;s like saying you don &apos;t work by electric light .
if you want to have an active sex life ,
part of it is texting .
hmm . i don &apos;t remember asking your opinion .
can &apos;t talk now .
shirley , since i might be the father of your unborn child ,
i made you a mix tape .
i hope you like johnny gill .
and since you probably don &apos;t have a cassette player ,
here &apos;s a list of used ones on craigslist .
britta , are you walking out of this room ?
uh--yeah .
hey ... you know that you &apos;re gonna
have to acknowledge him eventually .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
chang .
i know who you &apos;re talking about--he doesn &apos;t exist !
um , annie ?
i &apos;m sorry . a word ?
mm @-@ hmm !
i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but i did tv commercials for hawthorne wipes--
family business-- in the fifties .
i was kind of the gerber baby of moist towelettes .
that &apos;s great , pierce .
yeah , yeah .
oh , i &apos;ve done a lot of acting . workshops .
i do physical comedy . funny dances .
foreign accents .
accents ?
name any country .
russia .
point being , there are many tools i can bring to the table
that i think the script may be wasting .
pierce , you know what i think
is really great about this show ?
the only real star of it is the message .
right . uh ... is the message jeff winger ?
because he &apos;s on every page of this thing .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
you bet .
oh , britta left her phone .
she &apos;s getting a text message .
let me see .
oh . it &apos;s from marcus .
&quot; i &apos;ll be at the show tomorrow night .
&quot; can &apos;t wait to see you .
are you really wearing a cat costume ? &quot;
well , marcus ...
you are in luck .
what are you doing ?
dragging britta kicking and screaming into 1997 .
what did you say ?
&quot; there &apos;s not much to the cat costume ,
but can &apos;t wait to show you what &apos;s underneath . &quot;
how could you think that was a good idea ?
i got a better question .
how could it not be a great idea ?
what--
pierce ... what are you doing here ?
never mind that .
there &apos;s a rapist in the hallway .
that &apos;s my landlord .
and if he wanted to rape you , you &apos;d be raped .
did you follow me ?
let me answer your question with two of my own .
what are you doing in an apartment above dildopolis ?
and when did they open a second location ?
this is where i live , pierce .
it just happens to be above a marital aid store .
i don &apos;t get it . aren &apos;t everyone &apos;s parents rich ?
well , i &apos;m not speaking to my parents .
after my nervous breakdown ,
my mom wanted to put the problem behind us ,
and i wanted to deal with it , so i went to rehab ,
and she cut me off .
what are you living on ?
i saved . every penny from babysitting ,
every birthday check ,
every dollar from the period fairy when i was a kid .
i guess i thought it would last longer .
excuse me . what &apos;s a period fairy ?
the fairy that gives you a dollar
every time you get your period .
does she still come ?
pierce !
you know ,
you and i are very much alike , annie .
we &apos;re both realists . we &apos;re both cute .
and we &apos;d both rather die than let someone else control us .
i see the point of this place now .
this crap hole is a monument to self @-@ reliance .
i found the drapes in a dumpster .
can you believe it ?
yes .
you know , i wanna help , annie .
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no , pierce .
come on , now .
i &apos;m not taking money from you .
it &apos;s not mine . it &apos;s yours .
you &apos;ve earned it for being strong .
it &apos;s going to drop into your hands from out of nowhere .
because i was never here .
okay . i &apos;m only taking this
because i &apos;m a little worried about making rent ,
and they told me the procedure for selling eggs
takes three weeks .
you save your eggs for a rainy day .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
pierce ?
hey , why did you follow me here today ?
oh ! it was nothing , it ...
seems sort of pointless now .
i guess just to talk about the play
and ... who cares if i don &apos;t have any lines ?
well , you know what , pierce ?
you should do that line you improvised .
&quot; don &apos;t call me honey , honey &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
you should do that .
you were the gerber baby of moist towelettes , right ?
yes . yes , i was .
action !
hello . i &apos;m cornelius hawthorne .
one rainy day , my son pierce and i
were taking a stroll when i discovered
the cleansing power of moist cotton , fresh from the field .
isn &apos;t that right , son ?
it sure is .
it sure is , dad !
pierce , knock it off .
i wanna be in the commercial too , father .
well , then you should have done better in your damn audition .
what &apos;s your name , son ?
nigel .
you &apos;re a good boy , nigel .
your father is a lucky man .
okay , guys , remember ,
the most important thing is to have fun !
and the second most important thing
is to know all your lines and all your blocking
and not mess up a single thing .
actually--flip those .
here we go , guys . i took the liberty
of juicing up some of our bits .
um ... but--
pierce , you can &apos;t just revise annie &apos;s script .
and who uses wite @-@ out anymore ?
why don &apos;t we look over pierce &apos;s changes
and see if they improve things ?
&quot; hey , crayon , do you know
where i can get some drugs ?
i need them . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , you can get them anywhere . &quot;
&quot; anywhere ? &quot;
i &apos;m here !
zabba @-@ da @-@ zooey !
good one .
well , doesn &apos;t seem to hurt anything ,
so let &apos;s get into costume and break a stinger !
for the bees .
annie , uh ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t feel comfortable with the zabba @-@ da @-@ zooey line .
the one you wrote ?
i got it !
let &apos;s give jeff the zabba @-@ da @-@ zooey line ,
and then i &apos;ll come in with a good one .
yeah ...
it &apos;s more my voice .
pretty sure jeff is gonna reject that idea .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
you &apos;re the producer .
by the way , is this your pen ?
i ... think i put it back in my pocket
after i wrote you that check yesterday .
i &apos;ll give it to you later .
i &apos;ll talk to jeff .
also , i think it &apos;d be better for my character
if i wear his leather jacket .
okay !
welcome to greendale &apos;s drug awareness show !
okay . our volunteers are handing out
drug @-@ free baseballs , huh ?
next time you think about drugs ,
think about baseball instead .
can &apos;t ignore me forever .
okay , you probably can ...
i don &apos;t know why you want to .
i don &apos;t know if i told you my nephew marcus
actually goes to san ramone middle school ,
and he &apos;s coming to see the show .
marcus ? your nephew ?
yeah , he &apos;s 14 .
i actually thought he didn &apos;t even like me ,
but then he texted me out of nowhere and he said ,
&quot; can &apos;t wait to see you .
&quot; i &apos;ve been looking forward to this for so long .
you are the coolest aunt in the world . &quot;
i hope that i don &apos;t let him down .
you &apos;ll be great .
what does this symbol mean ?
it &apos;s a number eight , an equal sign ,
and then a greater than symbol .
let me see .
you &apos;d better get changed .
i &apos;ll hang onto your stuff for you .
great .
abed , we screwed up .
you know that text we sent ?
it was to britta &apos;s nephew .
he sent her an emoti @-@ penis .
what are we gonna do ?
fine . screw you , abed .
i can fix this .
&quot; marcus , i made a mistake .
i texted the wrong person last night . &quot;
&quot; you called me by name . it wasn &apos;t a mistake .
don &apos;t be afraid . &quot;
screw you , abed .
&quot; i was drunk . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m drunk too . on lust . &quot;
there &apos;s a picture .
oh ! that &apos;s disappointing .
wow , who does that ? that &apos;s ...
bees , you &apos;re up . cool cats , your on deck .
aren &apos;t drugs bad ?
no way .
drugs are like special honey .
they give you a buzzzzzzz .
don &apos;t call me &quot; honey , &quot; honey .
are you ignoring me because i &apos;m korean ?
you &apos;re chinese .
oh , there &apos;s a difference ?
shh !
it &apos;s because you &apos;re crazy , all right ?
there &apos;s something wrong with you .
and the idea that i was with you
means there &apos;s something wrong with me ,
and if this baby--
if you have any humanity at all ,
you will not make me think about it .
shirley , funeral .
well , that answers my question .
jeff winger is sexy even in a coffin .
i &apos;m here .
pierce , you &apos;re supposed to be onstage .
i was looking for a lighter .
what are you wearing ? this is a funeral .
i got this , annie .
i can &apos;t believe fluffy &apos;s dead .
i know i &apos;m green , but i feel blue .
look , it &apos;s drugs with a crazy wig and sparklers .
pokemon
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s right , drugs .
nobody asked you , crayon .
well , i hope you &apos;re proud of yourself , drugs .
look what you &apos;ve done .
oh , yeah ? well , look what i &apos;m doing now .
smells like something died in here .
what do you want us to do ?
should we get the dean ?
should we call in a bomb threat ?
should we set off the sprinklers ?
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
i think the kids are into it .
yeah , but i don &apos;t think that they &apos;re getting the message .
yeah , but do kids ever really seem
like they &apos;re getting the message ?
i think it &apos;s sinking in .
well , i guess it &apos;s your call .
and anyway , he &apos;s about to get flushed down the toilet
in the next scene , and he &apos;ll be done .
i wish i had never even met drugs .
who invited the nerd from the beehive ?
drugs made you .
how about you leave , drugs ?
they want more .
i gotta go back out there .
but pierce , you were flushed .
that was the story .
that &apos;s what &apos;s supposed to happen to drugs .
being flushed doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you &apos;re dead .
i mean , i could be a floater .
you know , a floater is when you have a number two--
i know what a floater is , pierce .
it just--it wouldn &apos;t make any sense in the flow of the show ,
and it sends a mixed message .
you know what i think is a mixed message ?
yesterday you couldn &apos;t pay your rent , and today you can .
come on , annie . you and i are alike .
we &apos;re independent . we need each other .
bzzz ! getting rid of drugs is a great i @-@ bee @-@ a .
i &apos;m flying higher than i ever have ,
thanks to not drugs .
i &apos;m back !
ain &apos;t no party without drugs !
i love you , drugs !
we want drugs ! we want drugs !
listen to that ! they &apos;re high on me !
i &apos;m a god !
where is that nigel now ?
and i haven &apos;t even used my penis material yet .
pierce , enough !
after intermission , i &apos;m going back to the original script
and doing some damage control .
damage ?
the only damage is me
blowing the roof off the universe .
i am not letting you go back on that stage !
well , maybe i won &apos;t be visiting you
late at night anymore with a generous spirit .
you sick , sick , sad old man .
this is why i didn &apos;t want to take money from my parents .
i don &apos;t want anybody pulling my strings .
wait , wait . is he giving you money ?
not anymore .
that &apos;s why the script got changed .
pierce bought his way in . annie sold out her message .
you &apos;ve been indulging this maniac ?
yes . i &apos;ve been indulging this maniac .
you &apos;re fired .
fired ?
next time i &apos;m at dildopolis ,
i will not be coming upstairs to say hi .
we want drugs ! we want drugs !
the only reason we did this was for you
and your stupid ideals ,
and it turns out you don &apos;t even have any .
we supported you , annie .
yeah , annie , you &apos;re fired .
i &apos;m sorry !
here &apos;s the situation .
we &apos;ve got 50 at @-@ risk preteens ,
armed with baseballs , chanting for drugs ,
who just spent intermission
eating nothing but charleston chews , thank god .
hope you can top act one , is all i &apos;m saying .
oh ! whoops .
we want drugs !
should we bail ?
works for me .
wait !
we want drugs !
listen to those kids .
we just created 50 potential meth heads ,
and the least we can do is hit the reset button
and get that number down to the national average .
that &apos;s a suicide mission .
did someone say crazy person ?
no .
well , i heard it .
we want drugs ! we want drugs !
greetings , you little snots !
you &apos;re not drugs .
oh , but i am !
disappointed ?
did you expect me to stay the same forever ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s not what drug does , baby .
i &apos;m gonna deep @-@ fry your dog and eat your mama &apos;s face
and i &apos;m gonna wear your little brother &apos;s skin like pajamas .
i control your lives
and there is nothing you can do !
let &apos;s kill him !
oh , bring it on , bow @-@ wow .
oh ! oh ! oh ! oh , my !
aah ! aah !
is that all you &apos;ve got ?
i gotta tell you , annie ,
this is the greatest chemical dependency program
i have ever watched .
i mean , the way you got the kids
to think that they needed drugs ,
and then having them realize
that dependence was the enemy ,
that the price was just too high .
oh , genius .
so now that the show is over ,
what is the plan for these bee costumes ?
aah ! aah ! uncle !
hi , marcus . i &apos;m jeff .
i &apos;m like , uh , britta &apos;s boyfriend .
look , dude , she started it , okay ?
she &apos;s just as into me .
no , listen , listen .
i &apos;m not mad .
i was just fooling around ,
and i sent those texts .
gross .
yeah .
well , it was pretty disgusting ,
sending those pictures to your aunt .
more disgusting than what you texted
to an underage boy ?
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t know you were you .
and i didn &apos;t know you weren &apos;t my aunt .
okay , all right ,
let &apos;s just call this a draw .
britta doesn &apos;t need to ever know about this .
okay , i &apos;d be happy to , for a price .
that was brave of you .
i owe you an apology .
it was rude to call you crazy .
maybe i haven &apos;t been giving you enough credit .
oh , that &apos;s really sweet . tell you what .
why don &apos;t i go get chang ? you can tell him that yourself .
oh , no .
my god , that was amazing !
wow !
good job !
thanks !
amazing !
way to go , man , go ! that was awesome .
they beat the crap out of you .
it &apos;s okay . i did a lot of ad @-@ libbing .
guys , i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you so much . that was amazing .
even i learned something .
oh , annie .
we did it .
group hug , group hug .
hug , hug .
way to save the day .
nice work .
did you get hit in the face with a baseball ?
yep .
annie , before you say anything ,
i just want you to know ,
even though i did nothing wrong ,
i &apos;m still gonna give you money .
no . i can &apos;t take your money , pierce .
i can &apos;t go from depending on my parents
to depending on you ,
which is why i &apos;m gonna get a job .
so you &apos;re cutting me off ?
no .
pierce , i know you don &apos;t depend on anyone ,
but you do depend on people depending on you ,
so i &apos;m not gonna take your money .
we &apos;re still friends ?
give me a day .
by the way ,
your mom was the period fairy , right ?
hey , guys , i found my phone ,
but has anyone seen my bra ?
