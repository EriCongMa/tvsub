第四季第九集
okay , this awkward silence has been going on for days .
granted , jeffrey looks amazing when he broods ,
but this has got to stop .
now , i don &apos;t know what happened ,
but we have to get to the bottom of this .
it &apos;s too embarrassing .
i understand .
you don &apos;t wanna talk about it ,
and you won &apos;t have to .
they will talk for you .
why did you make , have , and bring these ?
don &apos;t answer .
it &apos;s puppet therapy .
the psychology world has recently embraced it
after seeing it on law &amp; order .
you &apos;ll notice that each puppet is made in your likeness .
they were a rush job .
it &apos;s not like i had them on hand for personal use .
excuse me .
let me just grab this thing that &apos;s definitely not a whip .
in addition to being adorable ,
i know firsthand that puppet therapy
can and does work .
uh , dean , puppet kevin here thinks
i should have a candy bar right now .
no , you know how it winds you up .
fine . we &apos;ll split it .
all right . got money , bro ?
he &apos;s not what he seems !
wait . where &apos;s pierce ?
i know he &apos;s not with us , but is he still with us ?
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
although , no one &apos;s seen him
since he lost his mind in the woods .
you all were in the woods ? oh .
oh , so the puppets are working . okay .
how did it start ? what happened ?
we &apos;re not playing with puppets .
oh , jeffrey .
dean , what happened is between us and jesus ,
and jesus don &apos;t snitch .
yeah , and i don &apos;t need a puppet to express myself .
i already say whatever i want .
but i am a fan of the medium , so ...
my father is withholding .
that &apos;s interesting .
guys , are we just gonna avoid
making eye contact forever ?
who are we , jeff during sex ?
let &apos;s just give it a shot and move on .
fine .
if we &apos;re gonna play this game ,
then , unlike sex with britta ,
we &apos;re gonna do it quickly
and with a small shred of dignity .
jeffrey , dignity is my middle name ,
and my first name is
dean @-@ nocchio !
it all started on friday .
britta was talking about a few of her latest causes .
this one &apos;s for the greendale animal shelter ,
this one &apos;s for global warming ,
this one &apos;s for global cooling ...
and this one &apos;s for the amount of rubber wasted
while making stupid bracelets .
that &apos;s called rubber flubbing ,
and it &apos;s a real problem .
open your eyes , people !
britta said , &quot; open your eyes , people . &quot;
square .
nice .
what are you two doing ?
we &apos;re playing &quot; study group bingo . &quot;
study group bingo ?
we &apos;ve been best friends for four years ,
so we &apos;ve fallen into a comfortable , repetitive pattern
like humorous misunderstandings on three &apos;s company
or girls gossiping on gossip girl .
so to liven things up ,
troy and i made this bingo chart
of the predictable things we say .
this game is gay .
square .
you &apos;re mocking us ?
that &apos;s not a very christian thing to do .
square .
can we go back to studying now ?
square .
i don &apos;t like this game .
me neither .
i think it &apos;s mean .
there &apos;s no point .
yeah , it &apos;s insulting .
okay , stop .
square .
abed &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve had the same conversation a million times .
i guess we &apos;re kind of stuck in a ...
rut ?
yes .
but to be fair , there &apos;s not many things
you could be stuck in .
elevators .
bad marriages .
a peat bog .
on a flight in the middle seat .
time loops .
the bottom of a well .
your own emotions .
quicksand .
okay , stop !
square .
how did we get so predictable ?
and here is our state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art 1989 library
where ... oh , look !
it is my favorite study group .
they all really typify the diversity
we have here at greendale .
uh , ruggedly handsome leading man ...
a mom , an activist ,
a perfect student , a lifelong learner ,
a sidekick , and abed .
enough foreplay .
it &apos;s time to move this tour along
to meet my good friend magnitude !
yeah , prepare to be pop @-@ popped !
aw , he &apos;s a national treasure .
look , the problem isn &apos;t us .
we &apos;re awesome .
the problem is greendale .
it &apos;s pulling our strings , and we need a break .
yeah , our ferris bueller needs a day off .
hey , whose dad has a vintage ferrari ?
abed , a pop culture reference is more of the same .
we need to go big .
we need an adventure !
that &apos;s a good idea , annie , but there &apos;s one problem .
* where would we go ? *
* where , where would we go ? *
* we can go anywhere that you know *
* could we travel through time ? *
* or maybe see france ? *
* or anywhere else naked ladies will dance ? *
* could we fly in a booth *
* could we go to church camp ? *
* i &apos;d rather stay at greendale *
* could we ride a hot air balloon ? *
* yes ! *
* now , that &apos;s an adventure *
* well , we should go soon *
* - we can go anywhere in a balloon - yes . *
* that &apos;s an adventure *
* we can go high *
* - we can see anything up in the sky . - yes . *
* now that &apos;s an adventure . *
* pierce , bring your dentures . *
* we &apos;re so thrilled because soon . *
* we &apos;ll be in a hot air balloon . *
* hey , guys . i &apos;m the balloon guide . *
* before we take off , i &apos;m gonna check the balloon ties . *
* look at the burner , check out the basket . *
* if you have a question , feel free to ask it . *
* could we go to space ? *
* could we fly to heaven ? *
* i &apos;d rather fly to vegas . *
* it &apos;s getting time *
* to ride the balloon *
* yes , *
* now this is adventure about to go soon *
* - we &apos;re gonna go anywhere in the balloon - yes . *
* this is adventure *
* we &apos;re starting to fly . *
* we can see everything here in the sky . *
* this is adventure . *
* there &apos;s beautiful weather now outside . *
* and we &apos;re fine . *
* as long as we have a balloon guide . *
oh , no !
oh , boy .
from now on , no more singing in the balloon .
did i miss it ?
miss what ?
who said anything about a runaway balloon ?
okay , let me process this .
no !
oh , god .
we &apos;re really high .
i &apos;m really scared of heights .
guys , what are we gonna do ?
i had a dream it would end this way .
oh , jeffrey , you &apos;re on a runaway balloon ?
you could have died . you could have died .
how could you almost let him die ?
we all almost died , but we all didn &apos;t .
you know , plus , a near death experience
would &apos;ve only brought us closer together .
good point .
although it did get pretty hairy after that
especially once pierce started helping .
okay , everyone push down with me at the same time .
one , two , three !
come on , people . i can &apos;t do this alone .
you can &apos;t do it at all .
oh , look . a downstream .
pierce ! no !
if we fly to heaven ,
please don &apos;t tell my grandpa about me and britta .
this is not good .
there are so many clouds . it &apos;s so dark !
i can &apos;t even see the landing strip
or any of the other nudie bars .
oh , heaven , help us .
we must be a mile above the ground .
that &apos;s international airspace .
we &apos;re literally above the law .
jeff can marry any man he wants .
wait a second , guys .
i think we &apos;re starting to go down .
you see ? prayer works .
so does gravity , shirley .
and you know who invented gravity , right ?
guys , let &apos;s put a pin in the mysteries of the
universe convo until we land .
which will be sooner than we thought .
we &apos;re gaining speed fast , people .
oh ! brace for impact .
oh , damn you , gravity !
damn you , prayer !
damn you , vicki !
has anyone else noticed professor duncan
hasn &apos;t been around for a long time ?
maybe i can soften our descent .
pierce , no !
bring it to me strong , old man monkey strength !
okay .
okay , obviously , that was very scary .
post @-@ traumatic stress is a real issue ,
but with these puppets giving voice to our feelings ,
we can begin to heal .
this is gonna be a long and arduous process .
there &apos;s more .
hey , well , excuse dean
for reacting to the natural lull in your story .
i &apos;m so sorry .
when you hurt , i hurt .
what happened next ?
we made it .
everyone okay ?
i &apos;m alive .
square .
guys , knock it off .
okay , still alive ?
okay , we &apos;re all safe .
we just have to figure out
how to get back to greendale .
but we &apos;re in the middle of the woods .
where do we start ?
we need to split into two groups ,
the survivors and the others .
where &apos;s the manifest ?
oh , stop it with your lost references .
we need to get back home .
what if we &apos;re stuck here ?
we need to start a prison system .
we &apos;ll be stranded here forever ,
and i &apos;ve never seen blue man group !
guys , guys , we &apos;re gonna make it outta here .
we gotta relax . we &apos;re all gonna be fine .
what is that ?
i just want to say , if we &apos;re gonna die ,
i love you guys .
i love you all too .
i did see blue man group .
i just didn &apos;t get it .
why can &apos;t they talk ? they have so much in common .
others !
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to startle anybody .
and i thought my hair looked fake .
oh , you guys are a long , long way from greendale .
how did you know we &apos;re from greendale ?
oh , from pierce &apos;s shirt .
how did you know my name is pierce ?
it &apos;s embroidered on your greendale shirt
you got at the student store .
how &apos;d you know i got it at the student store ?
i &apos;m a touch psychic .
anyway , i used to go to greendale just like you guys
before i came out here to be free .
so this is how greendale graduates end up :
as transient mountain men .
not as bad as i thought .
but don &apos;t you miss having stuff ?
out here , you have everything you need .
and you can be whoever you wanna be .
* here in the woods , *
* you &apos;re totally free , *
* you can live off the land , *
* and be who you want to be . *
* we can be our own men . *
* and i don &apos;t need an &quot; a &quot; *
* the perfect mom pressure would all go away . *
* greendale is crazy . *
* and so is that moose . *
hi , troy .
* greendale turns people &apos;s screws so loose . *
* we &apos;re no exception to tell you the truth . *
* which is why the woods is perfect for all of you . *
* being socially conscious can be really tough . *
* here in the woods *
* you can forget all that stuff . *
* i don &apos;t like the pressure to always be cool . *
* i was gonna sing that now i don &apos;t have a rhyme . *
* we all try our hardest . *
* but the pressure in college *
* sometimes gets so tremendous . *
* that it would be stupendous *
* to be free far away from greendale *
* i really love these berries . *
* where are they from ? *
* my hand just made a rainbow . *
* - and my ... - magic , magic *
* well , these magical berries *
* put us in a drug seq ... *
* they make everything swirly *
* whoa , that bush sounds like shirley . *
* now we &apos;re free *
* far away *
* from greendale *
be free , my friends .
* - from greendale * - be free .
simply inspiring .
ten minutes ago , you weren &apos;t even speaking .
and now , you &apos;ve admitted that a strange man
hand @-@ fed you psychotropic berries .
this is puppet therapy work ...
dean ! there is a fire in the cafeteria .
garrett , not now !
where was i ? ah ! i was healing you .
go on .
well , those devil berries freed our minds
and loosened our tongues .
your skin is so beautiful
and soft .
it &apos;s like felt .
i feel so free out here ,
like i &apos;m my own man .
if jeff said we had to live out here ,
i &apos;d totally be down with that .
me too .
can i tell you guys a secret ?
yeah , sure .
i was at the grocery store with my kids ,
and i thought i saw andre walk by with another woman .
i love women .
i &apos;m gonna go take a growler .
anyway , i wanted to follow andre and the woman ,
so i left my kids at the magazine stand
for just a minute , but somehow ,
i lost track of time and ended up tailing them
all the way out of town .
it wasn &apos;t even andre .
the horrible part is i forgot my kids
and left them all night in the grocery store .
well ,
there y &apos;all go , giving me that look ,
treating me like judas ,
judging me like judy .
you know , judge judy . she judges people .
shirley , this is the first i &apos;ve heard of you
leaving your kids in a grocery store .
me too .
i have no memory of you saying that .
well , if you don &apos;t know my secret ,
why have we all been so awkward around each other ?
i thought everyone heard my secret .
i didn &apos;t hear you say anything .
so nobody else heard my terrible secret
about how i ...
trail off from time to time ?
did everyone here reveal a secret ?
and no one remembers anyone else &apos;s , including mine ?
those berries made us real talky
but not real listen @-@ y .
so if no one heard or remembers
anything anyone else said ...
we &apos;re in the clear .
we &apos;re in the clear .
i &apos;m a genius !
we &apos;re in the clear .
yeah !
we &apos;re in the clear .
um , guys ?
well , um , don &apos;t mind me .
i &apos;m sure you guys can get on with your lives
without the worst mom ever .
sounds good . anyone up for a movie ?
abed , sit .
shirley , you have nothing to be ashamed of .
no one thinks you &apos;re a bad mom .
thanks , jeff , but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just gonna go home now .
shirley , wait .
i think i know how to make you feel a little less horrible .
i like where you &apos;re headed . okay , who &apos;s holding ?
i have four berries ,
but i am saving them for laser floyd .
no , we all need to re @-@ share our secrets sober .
oh , god .
look , we were all feeling crappy earlier ,
but at least we were feeling crappy together .
shirley is alone now .
this is the only way to put us on equal footing .
and if it makes it any easier ,
we can use these puppets .
ah , yay !
shut up .
okay .
i found the perfect girl for me ,
and then , i met her kid .
* i said it didn &apos;t bother me but truthfully it did . *
* i promised him i &apos;d make it to a baseball game he had . *
* but i bailed and never called again . *
* and now i &apos;m just exactly like my dad . *
* i am an activist . *
* that &apos;s always been my choice . *
* truth is i &apos;ve never voted except when i watch the voice . *
* i was struggling in history i &apos;m normally the best . *
* i let cornwallis rub my feet to *
* give me all the answers to a test . *
* i caused the greendale fire of &apos; 03 , *
* 55 acres went up in a blaze . *
* all because i burned an ant hill . *
* this secret inside me *
* was trapped beyond a doubt , *
* and now my most terrible secret &apos;s out . *
there you are .
come on , guys .
* i &apos;ve never slept with the great eartha kitt , *
* we dry humped inside of her tour bus . *
* this secret inside me was trapped beyond a doubt , *
* and now my most terrible secret &apos;s out . *
i wanna thank you all for being so open and honest ,
and for syncing your mouth and hand movements .
and now , for my most terrible secret .
i am not what you would call traditionally ...
wait , abed , you never told us your secret .
that &apos;s right .
i didn &apos;t share one that night .
after we got back from the woods ,
everyone was being silent and not making eye contact .
i didn &apos;t know why , so i mirrored your behavior .
thank you , jeff ,
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re anything like your father .
i don &apos;t know how you take care of one kid ,
let alone three .
that &apos;s nice .
so nobody thinks i &apos;m a slutty cheater ?
no .
or me as a criminal ?
no .
nobody respects me any less as a political activist , right ?
the level to which we respect you as a political activist
has definitely not changed .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s how i would say it .
exactly .
bye , dean .
bye @-@ bye .
bye , dean .
knowledge is a party .
once again , i help fix everyone &apos;s problems
only to go home alone .
who says you have to be alone ?
jeffrey .
okay ... excuse me . what are we doing here ?
yeah .
no , gollum , no !
are we ready ? gonna take it from ... from ...
take it from your line , chevy .
oh , yeah .
ohh ! oh , it &apos;s happening .
dance , shirley . dance , girl .
there &apos;s so much skin !
ah , this is the best thing ever .
so much skin came off !
what &apos;d i miss ?
