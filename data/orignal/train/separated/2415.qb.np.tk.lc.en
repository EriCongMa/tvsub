he &apos;s dead .
no , no ! i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t !
i can help you . turn it off .
we &apos;re gonna lose her , damon .
she &apos;s ruthless without her humanity .
the cure &apos;s the fastest way to get it back .
katherine has the cure .
she &apos;s gonna want to cram it down your throat .
the last thing that you want
is for that cure to be used on you ,
so you bring it to me .
you don &apos;t scare me , silas .
just a little something to remember me by .
it &apos;s all of katherine &apos;s former addresses ,
including a couple from the last two months .
you want the cure off the table .
i want to take it .
we can work together .
why are we stopping ?
we &apos;ve searched 3 cities in the last 24 hours .
i &apos;m sick of top 40 radio , and i smell like leather .
and that &apos;s my fault ?
you are the one who stole the list of katherine &apos;s possible whereabouts .
did you ever think that damon had bad information ?
have i mentioned i can &apos;t stand the sound of your voice ?
too bad . we &apos;re not done .
get in . next town .
in a minute .
i &apos;m hungry .
we &apos;re not here for a pub crawl , elena .
i want the cure . katherine has it .
we don &apos;t stop until we find her .
i said , in a minute .
oh , my god . you startled me .
did i ?
katherine , what are you doing ?
you know me ?
of course .
um , i know most people around here
prefer you to feed from the neck ,
but i asked you to drink from my wrist . remember ?
conniving little bitch compelled the whole town .
i think we just found katherine .
what &apos;s my full name ?
katherine pierce .
i love the new &apos; do , by the way .
so how do you know katherine ?
how do i know who ?
me . how do you know me ?
small town . everybody knows everybody .
so everyone here knows katherine .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
she compelled people to forget all about her
unless she was talking to them herself .
clever girl .
how long have we known each other ?
uh , it &apos;s been a while . i can &apos;t remember .
where do i live ? where do i work ?
i don &apos;t know .
who do i spend time with ? do i have any friends ?
well , you said we could all be friends with you
as long as we kept your secret .
what secret ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know .
if they so much as even scratch the paint on my car .
why don &apos;t you just be grateful sheriff forbes
was able to track down the car after you let them , uh ...
you know , steal it from you .
remind me to send her some mini @-@ muffins .
do we really need 10 gallons of gas
or are you making me just lug this around as punishment ?
well , they ditched your car after it ran out of fuel .
we got to fill it up .
we got a hundred miles before we get to willoughby .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t remember that name
from the list of places that i got in new york .
oh , the list .
you mean the list they stole from right under your nose
after you let your guard down ?
they &apos;ll be there .
sheriff forbes tracked down the car they stole after yours .
screw the muffins . i &apos;ll get her champagne
if elena is wherever it may be .
willoughby--
the creamed corn capital of pennsylvania .
willoughby .
they &apos;ll be there .
let &apos;s just hope we get to them before they get to the cure .
ooh , silver lining .
if rebekah takes the cure , then she &apos;s mortal .
and then we can just kill her right then and there .
ooh , dark cloud .
elena stays a vampire forever .
look , why don &apos;t you just table the revenge fantasies for now
and just keep your eye on the prize ?
find katherine , get the cure , get out
before you get your neck snapped again .
believe me , i learned my lesson .
elena without humanity is a stone cold bitch .
and i won &apos;t trust her until we get the old elena back .
look at that . we &apos;re finally on the same page about something .
look at that .
klaus ? we need to talk .
what happened to you ?
silas .
he attacked me .
he stabbed me with the white oak stake .
a piece of it is still inside me .
my god , klaus , that could kill you .
i certainly feel like i &apos;m dying .
and as much as i would love to watch you die ,
you still haven &apos;t found me that cure .
silas !
that &apos;s right .
last night i looked like shane .
today i look like caroline .
and tomorrow , who knows ?
show me your real face .
now , why would i do that
when i can look like whomever i want you to see .
resist me all you want , klaus ,
but until you bring me the cure ,
i will bring you nothing but misery .
hey , excuse me . um ...
did i get any mail today ?
what happened to your hair ?
i cut it .
in the last two minutes .
i was here two minutes ago ?
are you feeling ok , ms. pierce ?
yeah . i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine . um , thanks .
she was here two minutes ago .
that means that she can &apos;t be that far .
how about you check inside ?
i &apos;ll look in the parking lot .
ok .
i &apos;m impressed .
i never thought you would find me here .
oh , well . it &apos;s a beautiful place to die .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
you &apos;ve chosen a beautiful place to die .
where &apos;s the cure ?
what , no &quot; i &apos;m here to avenge my annoying little brother &quot; speech ?
people die . we move on .
after turning off our humanity switch .
so sad for the boys , though .
their special snowflake of human frailty ...
gone .
well , if we &apos;re gonna be a while ,
i &apos;m gonna go grab some menus .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
i forgot how charming you were .
i &apos;m surprised you remember me at all ,
seeing as though you were so busy
wedging yourself between my brothers .
oh , my god . what happened ?
i &apos;m fine , jolene . you didn &apos;t see anything .
every minute you two waste with your yapping
is another minute we give stefan and damon to find us .
where &apos;s the cure ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m on vervain .
oh , i get to torture it out of you . fun .
why do you two want it anyway ?
the question is , why do you want it ?
let me guess . to kill niklaus .
i &apos;ve spent the last 500 years running from your big brother .
i have no intention of being within sniffing distance of him .
but since it can be used against him ,
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just itching to get his hands on it .
i give him the cure , he gives me my freedom .
ohh , you poor victim .
where &apos;s the part of your plan
where you screw us over and somebody dies ?
i have no reason to screw you over .
i know you don &apos;t believe me , but it is the truth .
people change . i &apos;m not the girl you think i am .
i don &apos;t have it on me .
i didn &apos;t think you did ,
but i &apos;m sure there &apos;s something in that that can help us find it .
who &apos;s em ?
a friend .
it says here you &apos;re meeting at 2 : 00 .
i guess i &apos;ll just have to meet em myself .
i got your 50 bajillion messages .
this better be life and death .
go away .
klaus ? where are you ?
what happened to you ?
i need more time .
stop hounding me !
i &apos;m hounding you ?
i am supposed to be running 3 different prom committees right now
and you keep phone stalking me .
caroline .
is it really you ?
prove it to me .
ok . i don &apos;t know if this is some new way of flirting ,
but it sucks .
and i have more important things to do .
wait , please .
silas . he stabbed me
with white oak stake .
there &apos;s a little piece of it stuck inside me .
why would silas attack you ?
well , i was in no position to ask questions .
suffice it to say , i &apos;m hurt .
so you can understand why i called you .
you ran tyler out of town , you killed his mother ,
and you think i &apos;m the person to call for help ?
if i die ,
you , tyler ,
all of your friends die with me .
what do you want me to do ?
well , it &apos;s quite simple , really .
i need you to cut the stake out of me .
something &apos;s not right .
katherine pierce does not hole up in hickstown , p @-@ a .
well , this is definitely the car they stole .
we &apos;re in the right place .
points to them for their choice of vehicles .
so let me ask you something .
what happens when we find elena ?
how do we get her back to mystic falls ?
i mean , she &apos;s not exactly gonna go quietly .
and she has an original vampire as her bodyguard .
we do whatever we have to do .
i don &apos;t care if we have to throw rebekah under a school bus
and wrap elena in a burlap sack .
we do whatever we have to do .
i &apos;m serious .
i am , too . i don &apos;t care what elena wants right now .
she &apos;s this close to going off the rails for good .
and that ain &apos;t happening .
she &apos;s a pain enough as it is .
so what happened to the guy who thought
elena should embrace being a vampire ,
let the chips fall where they may .
that guy got his neck snapped in new york .
and this guy is royally pissed off .
what do you think ? hmm ...
it &apos;s close . not quite slutty enough .
i think you need more eyeliner .
i &apos;m gonna need your clothes .
yeah . that &apos;s gonna happen .
fine . your bracelet , watch , earrings .
hand them over .
and your other bracelet .
that &apos;s my daylight bracelet .
it &apos;s daytime outside .
i &apos;m gonna need it .
besides , it &apos;s not gonna work on you .
fine . i really am gonna need that jacket , though .
all right . fine , fine , fine .
this will never work , you know ?
the bad haircut .
the doe eyes . you &apos;ll never pass for me .
you &apos;ll never pass for me .
throatier and more mannish .
you &apos;ll never pass for me .
you two are pathetic .
you two are pathetic .
oh , perfect . just the right level of contempt
and hidden insecurity .
almost there . something &apos;s missing .
your shoes . i want your shoes .
come on , em .
mm . you know , it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;ve always been a little envious
of the legend that is katherine pierce ,
the way you could wrap a man around your little finger ,
the way elijah betrayed klaus for you ,
the way the salvatore brothers stumbled head over heels for you .
and yet here we are all these years later
in a town that you &apos;ve had to compel into liking you .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t laugh .
it &apos;s really more sad than funny .
you know you can &apos;t split the cure with elena , right ?
she doesn &apos;t want to .
oh , no ? but you do . you want to take it .
are you really that dumb or just naturally blonde ?
i want a normal life again .
you mean you want a do @-@ over .
well , guess what . you can &apos;t have it .
the cure will only take away your immortality .
everything else you hate about yourself ,
you &apos;ll still wake up with that in the morning .
and you won &apos;t even be able to compel yourself a friend .
ladies , playing nice ?
there goes the neighborhood .
i see you got katherine already .
you &apos;re losing your touch , evil one .
where &apos;s elena ?
katerina .
elijah .
you &apos;re a little late , aren &apos;t you ?
you colored your hair .
i like it .
thank you . i was actually gonna--
i missed you .
and i &apos;ve missed you .
this is an interesting little town you &apos;ve chosen to settle down in .
so do you have it with you ?
do i have what ?
the cure .
it &apos;s in a safe place .
why don &apos;t i go and get it
and then i &apos;ll bring it back ?
where &apos;s katherine , elena ?
so let me get this straight ,
i tell you where elena is ,
you shove the cure down her throat ,
and then i end up in a box , right ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what about you over there , smiley ?
do you know where she is ?
i can give you a hint .
start by looking at the town morgue .
she &apos;s probably dead .
she went to meet up with a friend of mine .
you may know him--
an original brother . impeccable taste .
elijah ?
elijah &apos;s here ?
well , you sort of have to question
elijah &apos;s impeccable taste if he &apos;s friends with you .
oh , when i say friend , i mean &quot; friend . &quot;
it probably took him about 10 seconds to realize that she wasn &apos;t me ,
at which point he probably yanked her heart right out of her chest .
all right . where are they ?
rebekah ,
you do realize if something should happen to elena ,
you have no chance of finding the cure , right ?
fine . they were supposed to meet at the gazebo by the park .
i &apos;ll go talk to elijah .
you deal with elijah .
katherine will take us to the cure .
no , she won &apos;t .
the cure &apos;s my one chance to win my freedom back from klaus .
you &apos;re gonna broker a deal with klaus ?
no . she &apos;s gonna get elijah to broker a deal for her .
that &apos;s why you need your little friend , isn &apos;t it ?
some things never change , katherine .
nope .
fine .
move .
you have to follow me .
oh , my god .
you do have a heart .
oh , my bad . it &apos;s just a bloody rib .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re finding my misery so amusing .
i swear there &apos;s nothing in here .
and if you think i &apos;m having fun , you &apos;re insane .
you killed 12 witches for your friend bonnie .
you can &apos;t even get your hands a little dirty for me .
here i thought we were becoming friends .
well , you thought wrong .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what ?
i &apos;m not sorry .
you deserve to suffer for everything that you &apos;ve done .
so today , we &apos;re gonna do things my way .
you want my help ? you let tyler come back to town ,
and give me your word that you will not hurt him .
katerina ?
hello . elijah ?
where is katherine ?
where &apos;s elena ?
safe .
how long she remains so depends upon you .
well , i guess the same goes for katherine .
katherine can take care of herself against the two of you .
oh . you mean the three of us .
&apos;cause little sister decided to join team good guys for the time being .
put her on the phone .
oh , she &apos;s not here right now .
i left her with damon and katherine .
tell me where they are .
relax . no one &apos;s gonna get hurt
as long as katherine hands over the cure .
do you understand how much my sister despises katherine ?
i assure you , rebekah will end her
the moment she ceases to be of use .
well , just tell me where you are ,
and we can talk this through .
you listen to me very carefully , stefan .
if anything whatsoever happens to katherine ,
i will descend upon elena .
you &apos;re both idiots .
excuse me .
ugh . what happened to you , elijah ?
i mean , i thought you were supposed to be a man of honor .
and yet you &apos;ve been hooking up with katherine this entire time ?
well , i suppose this man of honor
always shared a connection with katherine .
she contacted me when she learned about the cure .
we thought we could be of mutual use to one another .
&quot; of mutual use &quot; ?
please . you fell for her trap
just like every other one of those idiots .
you underestimate me , elena .
i know who she is .
i know what she &apos;s done .
and you think she &apos;s changed ?
she &apos;s playing you . she lied to you , elijah .
she didn &apos;t lie to me about your transformation .
you &apos;re not just a vampire , though , are you ?
there &apos;s something else .
you ... you &apos;re not yourself .
you &apos;ve abandoned your emotions . why ?
my brother &apos;s dead .
your girlfriend killed him .
you didn &apos;t know ?
of course you didn &apos;t .
she lied .
i hate to say i told you so , but ...
no sudden moves . no tricks either .
no katherine @-@ ing .
a quilt and a fish aquarium .
who the hell are you ?
a very old lady with dreadful taste .
it &apos;s gone .
the cure , it was in the safe , but it &apos;s not there .
not falling for it .
where is it , katherine ?
i swear it was in the safe .
what , just like elijah &apos;s really your boyfriend
and this is really your life ?
and for all we know , this isn &apos;t even your house .
it doesn &apos;t look like the katherine i know .
maybe you don &apos;t know katherine at all .
did it every occur to you
that you have no idea who i really am ?
did it every occur to you that you &apos;re not that deep ?
this whole small @-@ town girl thing , we know it &apos;s an act .
where is the cure ?
whoa , whoa . hang on . we need her alive .
the cure &apos;s not here .
you check upstairs . i &apos;ll check down .
i got this .
so if i was a paranoid ,
distrustful sociopath ,
where would i keep my most prized possession ?
this should be fun .
because i &apos;d want it to be close , but not on me .
accessible but not obvious .
i &apos;d want to keep it safe ,
but not so safe that it &apos;d be too difficult to grab and run .
well , that is a fancy little treasure chest
in a tank with no fish .
i think i &apos;m gonna have to check that out .
vervain water .
looks like we have a winner .
give it to me or you &apos;re dead .
you &apos;re gonna kill me anyway .
so what &apos;s more important to you , huh ?
killing me or getting the cure ?
look , rebekah ...
don &apos;t even think about it .
let &apos;s just talk about this ,
like the two rational vampires that we are .
rebekah ?
oh , give it a rest .
me taking this cure is the best thing that &apos;ll ever happen to you .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
admit it . you don &apos;t want human elena
running back to stefan
whilst you &apos;re left out in the cold again .
go on , damon .
tell me why you want elena to have the cure .
that &apos;s what i thought .
no !
i can feel the splinters moving towards my heart .
help me !
your word first .
and what makes you think i won &apos;t simply break my word ?
you want to be friends ?
friendship--stage one .
show me that i can trust you .
i saved your life ...
twice .
because you put it in danger ...
twice .
why can &apos;t you just do something decent for once ?
because tyler lockwood tried to kill me .
we &apos;ve all tried to kill you .
and you &apos;ve tried to kill most of us .
how do you think that you deserve my friendship
when you &apos;ve done nothing to earn it ?
i will not have my hand forced by you or anyone else !
what is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m reaching out to you despite everything that you have done ,
and you still can &apos;t get out of your own way .
god ! i feel sorry for you .
don &apos;t turn your back on me !
i should have turned my back on you ages ago !
it &apos;s gone .
what ?
the pain .
the pain is gone .
oh , see , it was never there .
he got in my head .
silas ...
got inside my head .
you took my mind off it .
you brought me back , caroline .
if silas can make you , of all people ,
believe that you &apos;re dying ...
what can he do to the rest of us ?
did you even try to stop her ?
you forgot the part where i was bobbing for boxes in vervain water .
all you had to do was stall her , damon .
sorry . it &apos;s rebekah .
i didn &apos;t have a pony to distract her , stefan .
you let her take it , didn &apos;t you ?
you were never on my side .
now elena will be a vampire for the rest of her life
just like you wanted .
i know what it feels like to lose a brother .
i &apos;m sorry for your pain . i ...
i only hope that you can find your way back to yourself someday .
just like you hope katherine will find her way back ?
you still think that innocent girl
you saved from klaus ages ago is in there somewhere .
i &apos;d like to think so , yes .
she &apos;s not . she &apos;s a monster now , elijah .
the sweet peasant girl you fell in love with
way back when is dead .
and she &apos;s not coming back .
i &apos;m not a fool , elena .
of course this has occurred to me ,
but what kind of man would i be
if i didn &apos;t try to find my katerina
beneath this katherine facade ?
you boys are all the same .
damon and stefan still think
that the girl they love is still in here somewhere , too .
you can &apos;t blame them for having hope , elena .
it &apos;d be a shame if the world lost a soul
as compassionate as yours .
&quot; your compassion is a gift , elena . &quot;
&quot; carry it with you always and forever . &quot;
i remember reading that in a letter once .
well , the writer sounds positively gifted .
i &apos;m sure he meant what he wrote .
i &apos;m sure he did .
and it felt good to watch that letter burn
along with my old life
and along with jeremy &apos;s body .
sorry . i got held up .
how do you feel ?
i--i feel good . i ...
i feel great .
i feel alive .
slight problem with being alive--
i can kill you now .
i &apos;m still a vampire .
the cure didn &apos;t work .
it worked just like she wanted it to .
the cure was a fake .
it must have been a concentrated shot of vervain or something .
katherine .
oh , come on . she could use a nap .
it must be exhausting trying to be me .
you killed jeremy gilbert .
yes , elijah .
i killed jeremy gilbert .
a bombshell , i &apos;m sure . she just couldn &apos;t wait to drop on you .
ironic , since she supposedly doesn &apos;t care about anything .
i care .
do you honestly feel nothing for this girl ,
a girl fated to live the same life that you &apos;ve endured ?
and now you &apos;ve just taken away the last of her family ,
just as yours was taken away from you .
uh , why are you looking at me like i enjoyed it ?
jeremy was collateral damage .
i was doing what i needed to do to survive .
is that what i am , too ?
a means of survival .
don &apos;t let sweet little elena get to you .
she hates me . she wants you to turn against me
and convince you that i can &apos;t be trusted .
i asked you a question .
no .
of course you &apos;re not a means of survival .
you looked out for me when i had no one .
you &apos;re giving me a second chance now when no one else will .
i love you .
elijah .
you don &apos;t believe me .
i want to .
it &apos;s my disease .
i just keep wanting to believe you ,
but how can i when at every turn , you give me reason to doubt you ?
i don &apos;t know you .
i don &apos;t know that i ever will .
wait .
you gave me your word that you would talk to klaus .
i--i can &apos;t make a deal without you .
good @-@ bye , katherine .
katherine , hey .
what brings you by at this hour ?
i came to retrieve my package .
oh . of course . like i said ,
your secret would be safe here .
hey , um ... all the secrecy .
can i ask , what is it ?
it &apos;s my freedom .
wait .
what do you want ?
to tell you that you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ve spent so much time running and lying just to survive
that i don &apos;t--
i &apos;m starting to believe my own lies .
i don &apos;t even remember who i was when we first met .
and i want to find out .
you have the cure .
yeah .
and i can shove this down klaus &apos;s throat
and try to kill him ,
but even if i manage to do it ...
i &apos;d lose you .
and i don &apos;t want that to happen .
how do i know this isn &apos;t another lie ?
katherine pierce deceiving yet another man .
because i meant what i said
about my feelings for you .
and i &apos;d like to think
that you feel something for me , too .
i need you to trust me .
i want you to trust me ...
just like i &apos;m trusting you .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i &apos;m gonna let you decide where we go from here .
you and katherine ?
and i thought you were the smart brother .
you don &apos;t have a smart brother .
it turns out i &apos;m just as stupid as the rest of you .
why don &apos;t you just give me the cure
so i can judge you silently elsewhere ?
and what could you possibly want with the cure ?
i want to be human again .
how do you know that being human is the answer you &apos;re looking for ?
i mean , it &apos;s nothing but a romantic notion .
the grass won &apos;t necessarily be greener ,
rebekah .
you &apos;re probably right .
but i don &apos;t care .
i want to live a simple life as a normal person .
and when it ends , it ends .
we &apos;ve had 20 lifetimes together ,
elijah . isn &apos;t that enough ?
i just don &apos;t understand .
i mean , why must you always consider our family a burden ?
always and forever .
i mean , those words are as important to me today as they ever were .
you will always be my brother .
and i will never stop loving you .
but now it &apos;s time for me to live and die the way that i choose ,
not the way you and nik want me to .
please .
please just give me the cure .
what do you want , nik ?
an update on our search for the elusive cure .
let &apos;s just say that things have gotten complicated .
in fact , why don &apos;t you speak to one of those complications ? here .
complication speaking .
big brother .
at last you join the fray .
somebody had to take charge .
and now that i have , i &apos;ve got the cure
and i &apos;m bringing it back to mystic falls .
with a long list of demands , i assume .
not that long .
come home , brother .
we &apos;ll settle this like family .
i used all your bleach .
thank you for helping me .
yeah .
well , if you need anything else ...
don &apos;t call me .
i have a prom to plan .
friends then ?
are you gonna let tyler come back into town ?
you might have noticed ...
i &apos;m not exactly scouring the earth for him , am i ?
all right . you &apos;re right .
i let rebekah take the cure .
i thought for a second--
i mean , literally just a second--
if rebekah takes this , then all my problems go away .
and i couldn &apos;t think of one good reason to give it to elena .
and then rebekah took it .
and i realized how badly i screwed up .
so what &apos;s your point , damon ?
my point is , i &apos;m sorry , ok ?
i had a moment of weakness , stefan .
it &apos;s my thing .
it &apos;s like you and i falling for the same girl .
it &apos;s our thing .
was our thing .
look , we &apos;ve been making the same mistakes for 150 years .
we can judge katherine all we want ,
but we keep repeating our own history just like she is .
nothing ever changes . it has to stop , damon .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m done .
i can &apos;t keep reliving my life like this .
i owe elena her shot at being normal again .
once we give her the cure ,
i &apos;m getting her out of my life and i &apos;m getting a life of my own .
okay .
okay , let &apos;s just ... get the cure
and then we &apos;ll talk about
you riding off into the sunset all by you lonesome .
you still want to get the cure .
even if that means you might lose her .
it &apos;s a chance i &apos;m willing to take , stefan .
guess all we have to do is convince her .
sit anywhere you like .
you all right ?
what &apos;s up with the silent treatment .
you are the one that text us , wanted to meet up .
you know i don &apos;t want the cure .
you need to know that i never will
and i &apos;m done talking about it . so ...
will you accept that ?
and let me be who i am or not .
yeah , no .
elena , this isn &apos;t you .
it is now .
and you two really need to accept it .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t , there will be consequences .
listen , i was in the exact same situation that you are in right now .
my emotions were off , i wasn &apos;t me .
and you refuse to accept that .
you didn &apos;t give up on me .
you didn &apos;t stop until you pull me back .
let me just top that up for you .
thanks .
like i said , consequences .
that &apos;s one body you are responsible for .
if you keep trying to fix me ,
there &apos;ll be a second ,
a twentieth , and a hundred .
it &apos;s your choice .
