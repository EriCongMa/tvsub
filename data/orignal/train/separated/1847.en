Question -- when was the last time
a complete stranger took off her clothes in front of you,
pointed to a big purple splotch on her back, and asked,
"What the hell is this thing?"
Okay. How about it, Mark?
You know you've always wanted one of... these.
If you're a normal person, the answer is hopefully...
never.
If you're a doctor...
the answer is probably... about five minutes ago.
Nah. I'm good.
I will take that waffle iron.
What? I have never even seen you eat a waffle.
Well, I would if I had a waffle iron.
Okay, Callie,
we're not gonna take a waffle iron to Malawi,
and it's not gonna do anybody any good sitting in storage
for three years.
People expect doctors to have all of the answers.
Congratulations. You won yourself a waffle iron. Oh!
And a French press.
Hey. Stop giving... my things away.
Maybe I should pass on the French press.
The truth is, we love to think
that we have all of the answers, too.
So the Art & Lesley Phillips foundation
does have a few more hoops to jump through than the others...
but their primary focus is Alzheimer's research.
And if you get this grant,
it is more than enough to get us started.
Wow. You really did your homework.
I'm a great student.
Just the kind you want around when doing a clinical trial.
How's that going?
It's fine.
Is this because Richard gave Hunt
the $1 million and not me?
Is that why things are frosty between you two?
We're not frosty. We're fine.
But if you're looking for solidarity,
I would be more than happy to skip
Owen Hunt's trauma certification lab.
Go. Get certified.
Basically...
doctors are know-it-alls...
until something comes along that reminds us we're not.
Hey, I need someone to help me
set up the trauma lab and keep things running smoothly.
You'd get your certification that way,
and it's a pretty easy day.
It's a skills lab. It's already an easy day.
Dr. Hunt, I'm going to need to borrow Dr. Yang.
Oh. Uh, what's up?
Lungs have become available for Roy Henley,
and since he found himself on the transplant list
based on Dr. Yang's recommendation,
I would say that that would make him her patient.
Okay. Uh, what do you need me to do?
Well, I just need someone to monitor him
while I go pick up the lungs.
So I'll be on my own?
Nope. Dr. McQueen, the cardio fellow,
he will be around on the off chance that you need anything.
Oh, and I finally was able to get Roy's daughter
to agree to come in,
so just, uh, keep an eye out for her, okay?
Okay.
You'll be fine. Still an easy day.
I know.
Am I early? I tried really hard not to be.
That doesn't bode well.
We did the same thing with Bailey when we were interns.
Take turns treating a dummy, get an early lunch,
then get back to work. It's lame.
Charter plane was forced into an emergency landing
and collided with a Greyhound bus.
Mass-casualty situation.
Do I need to say it again? Let's move.
Close to 30 victims in the field, some critical.
Multiple blunt trauma injuries.
And I was so looking forward to an early lunch.
This is gonna suck.
Welcome to trauma certification. You will work in teams of four.
Each team will be responsible for nine casualties.
You may treat your patients using only what you can carry
with your two hands from this ambulance.
The evac helicopter is on its way.
You get your patients on the helicopter,
you get certified. Are you ready?
Get to work.
Dr. Grey.
Uh, Christy Cornell, age 28.
She's here for a gluteoplasty.
She's so tiny. There's hardly anything there to lift.
That's sort of the point, Dr. Grey.
I'm... Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. That was--
Oh.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
Christy's not here for a lift.
She's here for a gluteal implant.
Yes. Finally gonna get some junk up in this trunk.
This program shows a rendering of what you can expect
the gluteus to look like after the implant.
Um... Could I see what it'd look like
kicked up a -- just a couple of points? - Sure.
Couple more?
Couple more?
Okay, stop. That's it.
That's my ass.
Oh, come on. That was funny.
Any joke that starts with an animal walking into a bar
is scientifically unfunny.
Well... humor me, Dr. Yang.
I need something to focus on.
I don't know if I'm more nervous about getting new lungs
or about actually seeing my daughter.
Don't think of it as getting new lungs.
Think of it as getting rid of old, crappy lungs.
Or don't think at all. Okay, Roy.
Take some deep breaths. Okay?
Corinne?
Roy.
How you been?
This week or for the past 20 years?
I'm sorry. That was snarky.
No. No, snarky's good.
I like snarky. You get that from me.
Roy? Roy?
Get the crash cart! - He's -- he's not breathing.
V-fib! Page cardio.
Aren't you the doctor? Do something.
Um... - What-what's -- what's happening?
Your father's developed cor pulmonale,
and his heart is overloading.
What? I-I-I don't -- I don't understand.
I thought his lungs were the problem.
H-his lungs are putting extra pressure on his heart.
Dr. Altman is picking up the new lungs right now.
I'll call her and apprise her of the situation.
What situation? What is going on?
His heart is failing.
And the damage seems pretty severe,
so...
Uh, there's a possibility he'll need a new one.
A new what? A new heart?
You know what? Take over here.
I am going to call Dr. Altman,
and, uh, uh, I'm gonna get McQueen.
Dr. Bailey, do you have a second?
Only if what you have to talk about is more important
than my being on time for an autopsy.
Uh, that's arguable.
We're throwing Torres and Robbins
a bon voyage party in the doctors' lounge this evening.
Oh, that sounds lovely. Uh, I have a full day.
But I'll try and stop by.
Well, the thing is Altman volunteered,
uh, to pick up the cupcakes,
but she had to pick up lungs instead.
And I just figured, since you are close to both these ladies --
You're asking me to take time out of my very busy day
to go to the bakery?
Or would you prefer that I ran on home
and baked some myself?
No. Of course not.
Just an invitation.
Mark.
I need to talk to you about Christy Cornell's...butt.
Okay.
But first I need to talk to you about cupcakes.
Callie. Check out all the great stuff the kids in peds made me.
They want me to take pictures
of their crafts in Africa.
Oh, wow. That's awesome.
You'd be surprised how often you find yourself in need
of a macaroni face glued to a paper plate.
No. I mean, it's way better than gauze,
malaria pills, antibiotics.
Well, you are a delight this morning.
Is there something that you'd like to talk about?
Um...no.
No, I'm just... no.
Torres, Robbins.
I thought you'd be halfway to Malawi by now.
Yeah, we had some last-minute paperwork.
Plus, I-I promised the kids I'd come and say good-bye.
That's good. The work you two will be doing there
will reflect very, very highly on this hospital.
Sure, uh...
it was a surprise to learn that I'd have to replace two,
uh, excellent attendings as opposed to just the one.
But then that's a chief's problem.
No one wants to really hear a chief's problems.
It's a shame, though, Torres.
I had, uh...
I had such big plans for you.
Big plans.
Irrigate and suction.
Thanks. Clamp, please.
Dr. McQueen, I really need you to take a look at Roy Henley.
They tell me he's developed cor pulmonale
and circulatory collapse.
Yes, sir. That's correct.
Did you put him on dopamine,
milrinone, and nitric oxide?
Yes, I did.
He's stable. Critical, but stable. I--
What would you do for a patient
with reduced cardiac output,
hypotension, sinus tach, and metabolic acidosis?
I'd insert an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Exactly.
I'll be there when I can, Dr. Yang.
But it really doesn't sound like you need me at all.
Irrigate and suction, please.
You must be Dr. Bailey.
I'm Dr. Stanley, head of pathology.
This must be...
Mary Portman, 30,
multiple organ failure, cause unknown.
She came in for a standard colostomy reversal
and never woke up.
Well, all right.
Looks like we've got something we can sink our teeth into.
Um, I have a list of possible causes
I'd like to check as we proceed.
We have a specific order to the way we work down here,
so we'll see what we see when we see it, okay?
Okay.
According to this card, this guy's got a blown right pupil,
an atlantooccipital dislocation, open-book pelvis,
a large open abdominal wound --
Jeez! -- a sucking chest wound with seven broken ribs.
This guy is all messed up.
Or he's dead.
Ah. Right. Yes.
Moving on.
Cristina?
Hey. How long have you been here?
Oh, not long. I just needed some fresh air.
And how's the patient?
Uh, he's fine. He's great. A couple of complications,
but yeah, I'm handling it.
Are you sure that you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's, uh...chilly out here.
It's him. Um...I need to --
I...have to go look.
Okay. All right.
Cristina.
You can do this.
Okay. Thanks.
Grey.
Congratulations. You're, uh, you're certified.
Now can you go inside and, uh, give Cristina a hand?
Well, what does she need? Did she ask for me?
Meredith...please. Okay?
Yeah.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Owen sent me.
I don't need a babysitter.
I'm just an extra set of hands. What's the situation?
He went into cardiogenic shock,
so I'm inserting an intra-aortic balloon pump
and hoping there are no other complications before Teddy gets back.
So we are watching for hemolysis, a gas embolism,
a blue leg from peripheral ischemia --
Okay, you know, if you want to do something, uh, his,
uh, daughter is up in CCU,
and she needs an update.
Okay.
Blue Team, status report.
We arrived on the scene to find nine casualties.
We identified three as priority one,
requiring immediate evacuation. Four were priority two,
allowing for delayed evac.
One was priority three,
and the last was sadly...dead on the scene.
Nice work, Kepner.
But it seems to me that
you now have two dead patients.
Excuse me?
Well, while you were standing around
waiting for the helicopter to arrive
and not keeping a constant eye on your patient's injury,
this one developed a femoral bleed,
bled out and is now sadly dead.
No, a-a femoral bleed -- that wasn't on the card.
Really? Well, it's on this one.
O-oh, no, no, no. Wait. That's not fair.
Patients don't suddenly die.
It just seems that way when you stop paying attention.
Food for thought. Red Team, go.
I'm so sorry, you guys.
Those guys right there are priority three.
We tagged these over here as priority two.
Awesome.
Tell me about the bandaging on these two.
Priority ones...
Right. The reservation's under Stanley. Jennifer Stanley.
4 people for 8:00.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would 8 people want to have dinner at 4:00?
Dr. Stanley, the-- the clots
could indicate a pulmonary embolus.
Let me talk to your manager.
Dr. Stanley.
What's up?
I was asking about those blood clots.
Now couldn't a pulmonary embolus have led to her death?
Those are postmortem clots, Dr. Bailey.
Perfectly normal.
Hello. Hi.
Yes, there's been a mistake with my dinner reservation.
"Big plans." "Big plans."
You know what? I don't care.
I've got big plans myself-- great big African plans.
Yeah, you do.
Yeah. I don't need to grow cartilage in a lab.
I'll be building bones from dirt.
I'll be figuring out how to create unbreakable joints
out of blood diamonds.
I'll be-- I'll be making artificial limbs out of elephant ivory.
I'm pretty sure a couple of those would be frowned upon
by the world community.
Oh, whatever.
Science isn't about making friends.
The helicopter has to be getting here soon.
It's been three hours. Just-- just a few more minutes.
Here. Take these.
Right? Right, Dr. Hunt?
The helicopter will be here any minute?
Nice rain gear, Karev.
Shouldn't you be more concerned with your patient staying dry?
Yeah, well, he's a dummy, and I'm a person, so...
You know, a dry patient is less likely to die
of hypothermia or shock.
Something to think about.
Alex, you can't break the rules like that.
That's unsanctioned use of a trash bag.
You're gonna mess up our certification.
Oh, you need to relax. This whole uptight thing?
This is why you have no friends.
Hey.
Okay, this is why you have one friend.
Give me that back!
Are you crazy?
There you go, little guy.
No hypothermia for you.
Everyone.
Green Team's patients are all dead.
Only Red Team and Blue Team remain.
Whoa. You see a helicopter?
Take a knee, learn something.
Take a knee?
He's gonna scalp them.
We're in <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, and we're gonna get scalped.
That, right there. See what she's doing?
Okay, I-I swear. I'm-- I'm not an idiot.
I just-- if-- if Dr. Altman
doesn't get this new heart,
is that, like, game over on the lung transplant?
Uh, there are a variety of factors.
Right now, I'm not sure, but I can get an answer for you.
Fine. Uh, where are we on the heart?
Again, not sure.
Dr. Altman should be calling with an update very soon.
Okay. Uh, when can I see him?
I have to check with Dr. Yang.
You're just like a--
you're just like a wealth of information, aren't you?
I'm sorry. I'm new to your father's case,
and Dr. Yang is
I called him Roy.
I decided to do that on the drive over
'cause I hadn't seen him in 20 years,
and I want to blame him for that.
I do blame him for that.
Except...
he tried.
He tried to be... my dad in the beginning.
And... I couldn't forgive him for leaving my mom.
And then he stopped trying.
And...
I have twins. They're 3.
And I don't even know if he knows that.
I never told him.
And then... and then I walked in there...
and I called him Roy.
I called my dad Roy.
And I just...
I need for that to not be the last thing he hears from me.
Please.
The daughter really needs to talk to you.
She has too many questions that I can't answer.
Why don't you try reading his chart?
Cristina, if you want to be pissed at me, that's fine.
But don't--
Okay, you know what?
We're not gonna do this right now,
'cause I'm kinda busy here.
Crap.
All right. Look, get him on ECMO.
That should keep him alive until I can get back with these lungs.
There is a shot that once we get them in,
the heart damage will reverse without the excess pressure.
Teddy says we need to get him on ECMO.
What's it look like I'm doing?
Okay, apparently, uh, Cristina's on it.
Grey...
How's she doing?
Uh, she is doing great. She's doing great.
Good, good.
Intestines show a well-healed anastomosis
with no evidence of infection,
inflammation, or necrosis.
I think this is as good a place as any to call lunch.
What do you say?
Lunch? Well, we have to check
the adrenal glands and the kidneys.
What if the thyroid shows pathology?
Don't worry.
Those kidneys aren't going anywhere on their own.
Yes, I'm aware,
but microscopic pathological changes
are harder to interpret once the organs start decomposing.
We'll only be gone 45 minutes. They'll keep.
Still, I don't think it's right--
Okay, Dr. Bailey, I'll see you in 45 minutes.
I don't know.
They're chocolaty looking with sprinkles.
Where'd you get 'em?
At that grocery store down the street.
This isn't a baby shower for some nurse
who couldn't keep her knees together, Grey.
Torres and Robbins deserve better than off-brand crap.
I'm not an errand girl. Okay? I'm a doctor with a patient
who's about to make a giant butt-shaped mistake.
That's not for you to say.
Okay, well, someone has to.
The only reason a woman does something like this to her body
is to impress a guy.
Okay, sure, it starts with a giant butt,
and then the next thing you know, she's giving up her friends,
she's moving in with him before she's even ready,
and if she's not careful, she'll find herself a 26-year-old stepmother
to the pregnant daughter she didn't even know he had.
And then she's single, dyeing her hair a new color.
And you know what? It's really hard to manage your roots
when you've been committed to the psych ward.
Psych ward?
It happens.
Great. You're in here.
Now where can I sulk?
Oh, there's plenty of room. That's all I'm doing.
Please sit down.
What's the matter?
I have been down in the morgue all morning
trying to determine the cause of death for Mary Portman,
who survived the horrors of Gary Clark
only to die from a surgery that I perform every day.
So it's very important to me,
and it's very important to Mary's husband,
to find some answers today.
But do you know what is important to the pathologist
who is leading the autopsy?
Oh, her dinner reservations and her lunch break--
basically food--
That's what's important to this pathologist.
Feeling better?
No. Not really, no.
What's all this?
Oh, I'm just trying to write this grant proposal.
Why only trying?
Because the more you research Alzheimer's,
the more depressing it gets.
And then when you include the early onset,
the type that Ellis Grey suffered from,
it just gets worse.
There's a woman in England. She's 32.
She can't recognize her 3-year-old daughter.
It's just... terrifying.
This pathologist also chews gum while she works.
Oh, my god.
That's disgusting.
Thank you.
Christy.
Yes.
Dr. Grey is concerned that, uh, you might be
going through with this surgery for the wrong reasons,
that you might be trying to please someone
who prefers a more...
robust body type.
Mm. Dr. Grey.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
But even through your lab coat,
I can tell, you have an amazing ass.
And with an ass like that, I bet you know what it's like
to find the perfect pair of jeans.
Jeans that make you feel like
you're the sexiest person ever to put on a pair of pants.
And I envy that, 'cause I never have.
Every pair hangs off me...
unless I shop in the boys' department.
And I have tried gaining weight, Dr. Grey.
It turns out, I'm a person
whose fat goes straight to my upper arms and my boobs,
which makes it really hard for me to wear a sundress,
which is all I can wear,
because jeans don't fit.
So, Dr. Grey, I am getting a big, juicy,
easy-to-grab-on-to ass,
And you better believe, I am doing it just for me.
And I'm telling you... I can't wait.
You are so nice.
Okay, Red Team's patients have all died.
Only Blue Team remains.
Keep an eye on Karev. That's what resourceful looks like.
Good effort, Avery.
But this incision you made is too wide.
You lacerated the superior thyroid arteries.
Well, I just--
Move on.
Damn it!
I hear it. I hear the helicopter.
You what?
I- I-I-I hear it! I hear it!
Oh, wake up!
You don't hear the helicopter
because, A, it's imaginary,
and B, the imaginary helicopter is never coming!
Hunt's trying to break us, trying to teach us
some B.S. lesson about how trauma isn't fair or whatever.
We're not done until he says these dummies are dead.
The end!
That's not true! No!
You are wrong!
Screw this. I'm done.
What?
Jackson!
Avery, where are you going?
You-- ugh!
Avery. Avery, get back here.
No!
No?
No, Sir.
That should do it.
Close her up and call it a day.
Aren't we gonna get a sample from the brain?
Sure,
in about two weeks, when it's had a chance to firm up in the formalin.
Oh, it's possible to cut the brain fresh.
It's also possible that the moment
you cut into a fresh brain, it slides apart like Jell-O.
If you don't want risk that,
you put it in formalin and wait two weeks.
I- I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but you--
No, that's exactly what you're trying to do,
and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you.
This is what I do, all day, every day.
I mean, do you think I failed medical school?
Is that your actual belief, that people become pathologists
because they fail to become surgeons?
The autopsy was inconclusive, Dr. Bailey.
And believe me, I hate that at least as much as you do.
He's stable?
He's critical.
I have to keep, uh, checking his acid-base balance,
but, yes, he's stable-ish for now.
Great. So let me take over here,
and you can go give his daughter an update.
No, you go.
Um, tell her that his, uh, blood pressure is coming up--
She needs to hear from you.
Well, he needs to be monitored.
Well, I can do that.
Okay. She doesn't need to hear an update from me.
All she wants is to make sure that I know that she's afraid,
and I can't hear that right now...
because I am scared enough as it is.
I was scared when he coded.
I'm scared now that he's stable.
I'm scared walking across the lobby.
I am scared all the time.
Well, let me help you.
You cannot help! Okay? You can't help me.
Dr. Altman's 30 minutes out.
We need to get him to the O.R.
Dr. Grey can help with that.
Cristina...
Bon voyage!
Oh, my god. It's a going away party.
You guys.
Um... this is a party?
It's... a busy day.
No. Yeah, I mean, I'm...
I've just been at this hospital since residency. But, uh...
if people are too busy to see me off,
then they're too-- they're too busy.
Callie...
Well, it's hard to blame 'em, Torres.
I mean, we're down a couple of attendings.
Things are going to be busier all around for a while.
Well, I'm glad you could find the time, Chief...
with all your chief problems and big plans...
which were what exactly?
Now why would I just give away my good ideas?
Oh, he's just crabby. He's messing with your head.
Yeah, well, I'll never know, will I?
Thank you, both, so much.
Um, I-I actually have to finish up some packing.
So I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go.
Good luck.
Give 'em hell.
I- I don't want to go home yet.
You want to see us give a lady a really big ass?
Oh, my god, yes.
Sir!
You said the helicopter was gonna be here hours ago,
and it's not here, and I'm not complaining,
but where is it?
Well, the rain's still pretty bad.
Probably got caught in a hail storm.
No!
No! I know what that card is gonna say.
It's gonna say he has cardiac tamponade
with associated hypotension and bradycardia,
but he can't,
'cause I already did a pericardiocentesis
and bolused him with I.V. Fluids.
She's right.
What do I do? Do I--
Karev!
Grab his feet.
The patient!
Son of a bitch.
That's awesome!
What do you think you're doing?
This ambulance is not in play.
Oh, you're just making stuff up,
which I can do, too! And I say it is in play.
Can't fit nine patients on an ambulance.
But two will fit just fine.
Seven of my patients may have died today,
but these two won't! 'cause I'm gonna get them
on this ambulance,
and I'm gonna take 'em to that hospital right there!
All right!
Kepner,
this ambulance was involved in the accident
and no longer runs.
There are keys in the ignition, so let's see.
Looks like I got Triple-A. Ha!
Apparently they could get here
when the helicopter couldn't.
Now move!
Or I will run you down!
Let's go. Let's go.
John Doe, multiple chest and extremity traumas.
Still hypotensive despite two large-bore I.V.S started in the field.
All right, Kepner. That's enough.
We need a full workup and
likely a thoracotomy.
I suspect active bleeding in the chest.
Will you tell us we won,
or she's never gonna stop.
It's not a contest.
Karev!
Call the O.R. And make sure that there's a room available.
Will do.
All right, all right, fine.
Blue Team wins.
Blue team wins?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you win.
He's gonna live for 40 more years
and have 15 grandkids. You happy?
Blue Team wins!
Yes.
Here. Check that out.
"Alzheimer's is a bad disease.
We should cure it."
12 hours worth of work.
Dr. Stanley refuses to cut into Mary's brain
without letting it set in fixative for two weeks.
Look, I need you to go over her head.
I can't do that. She's right.
I can't speed up the process any more than she can.
That is not what you were supposed to say.
Look, Miranda, I know this has been...
a very personal loss for you,
but you need to let it go.
I have to go and tell Mary's husband
that I don't know why his wife died,
that I can't answer the one question he has to ask.
And I can't answer that question
because medicine-- because science is failing me.
that I take personally,
that I can't accept.
And don't you dare stand there
and talk to me about letting things go.
I'm not the one who can't stop thinking about
the possibility of his wife getting Alzheimer's
long enough to write a damn essay.
Shouldn't you be with the patient?
He's prepped and in the O.R.
And now you're gonna talk to me.
Please just go back downstairs.
Cristina.
How are you fine?
How are you just completely fine?
I'm ruined, okay?
I am dead. I am wrecked.
And you're just walking around, what, babysitting me?
As if you didn't go through the same thing, too?
Why are you okay?
I don't know.
You know what? You-- you were there, too, you know?
You were there, too, with your sad eyes,
screaming at me to save his life...
I wasn't...
You know, then telling the guy to shoot you
and not giving a crap about yourself or your pregnancy.
Cristina--
I didn't have a choice! And you did that!
If it was anyone else on the table,
if it was anyone else standing there,
I would've walked away!
You would not have--
I could've walked away, and then I wouldn't--
You wouldn't have walked--
be here!
Walk with me, Dr. Yang. Tell me everything.
Now who am I gonna talk to about women?
You have Derek.
He's married and self-satisfied.
It's irritating.
Well, you can always e-mail.
What?
It's not my place. I don't...
Say it.
I give a lot of boob jobs.
Okay. Not where I thought you were going.
But I also reverse a lot of boob jobs.
Women come to me a year,
two years after they've had work done...
and they're totally unhappy with the decision they've made.
Today, though,
you watched me give a lady a really big ass,
and-- and I'm not the slightest bit worried about it,
because I know for a fact,
there's no boyfriend pressuring her.
It wasn't about anyone else. It was for her.
As your friend, I gotta tell you,
you sound an awful lot like someone
who's getting double D's
just 'cause her girlfriend likes a big rack.
By "big rack," I mean Africa.
I love her, Mark.
I know you do.
But you need to figure out...
how to love Africa, too.
Avery. Hey.
Hey. You don't get to just walk away when I'm teaching.
Two of my friends died during the shooting,
so... thanks.
I don't need lessons on how unfair trauma is.
I lost dozens of friends in the field... dozens.
And I have never-- never--
used them as an excuse to quit.
You're a doctor, Avery.
That doesn't stop just 'cause you're up against a wall.
You need to figure out how to be a doctor
no matter what you're dealing with
and no matter what tools you don't have.
That is the lesson you need to learn.
You don't get to quit.
So if I need to drag you outside by the throat,
you are coming with me and you are going to finish!
If his heart doesn't start beating soon,
we're not gonna be able to take him off bypass.
He's back up to his core temperature.
I don't see any leaks. All the connections are right.
We're just gonna have to wait and see
if Dr. Yang's hard work has paid off.
There it is.
Nice work, Dr. Yang.
Well done.
Clamp.
And, you know, sure, there's not a lot to do over there,
but, uh, that just means less to distract us from the medicine.
It'll just be us focusing on the medicine, which is great.
What? Oh, my god. Did you forget your passport?
I won the Carter Madison Grant.
I won the Carter Madison Grant.
Do you know how rare that is?
Do you know how special that is?
This is the biggest opportunity of my professional career.
I- I get to go to Malawi with almost unlimited funds
and help children-- help tiny humans--
who might otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon.
I get to change lives.
That's the dream. I am living the dream.
And I am over the moon about it.
Or I-I would be, but you are ruining it for me,
First with your whining,
and now with your fake, smiley, passive-aggressive enthusiasm.
You are ruining Africa for me.
I - I'm not.
You are!
Okay.
Fine. I don't want to go to Africa. Okay?
But I do want to be with you.
Okay? So I'm really trying here.
We're gonna miss our plane. Let's go.
Oh, god. Okay. You want to fight?
The flight's 18 hours. We can fight on the plane.
You're ruining this for me.
and I don't want to do this.
What-- what'd-- so what does that mean?
What, you suddenly don't want to go or...
I don't want to go to Africa with you.
Arizona... No.
Okay? No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're sorry? You're sorry?
It's three years.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
You take care of yourself.
No.
No!
Please. Please. I can...
We can-- we can do this.
We can-- we can figure this out.
You stay here...
and be happy.
And I'll go there...
and be happy.
If you get on that plane,
if you go without me, we are done.
Do you hear me? We are over!
We are standing in the middle of an airport
screaming at each other.
We're already over.
Yang.
Dr. Altman told me about your work today.
I know it's been hell for you these past few months,
so...
Well done.
Thank you, Sir.
Chief.
Do you have a minute?
I can't wait until the next skills lab.
I am totally on your team.
"Move or I'll run you down!"
Freakin' hilarious.
We're all looking for answers...
in medicine...
in life...
in everything.
Were you just checking out my ass?
Not the first time.
Won't be the last.
No!
Sometimes the answers we're looking for
have been hiding just below the surface.
I had the worst day today.
Been working, um...
working on the grant proposal,
and I just-- I couldn't do it.
And then I realized...
it was you.
It's a clinical trial for Alzheimer's.
It's serious work, and I couldn't think of anything but you.
I know you want to be a part of the trial,
but I can't have you anywhere near it.
Cristina blames me.
She hates me.
Other times,
we find answers when we didn't even realize
we were asking the question.
Avery, good.
Sometimes...
the answers can catch us completely by surprise.
Did you hear? The lab--
it could not have gone better, and you should've seen Kepner.
I mean, you wouldn't think it to look at her,
but there is a trauma surgeon in that girl.
I wish you could've been there.
How was your day?
I quit.
What?
You were right.
I can do it. I can still be a surgeon.
I just...
don't want to anymore.
And sometimes,
even when we find the answer we've been looking for...
Avery, that's enough.
