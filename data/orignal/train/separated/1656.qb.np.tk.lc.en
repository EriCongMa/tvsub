i &apos;m going out tonight , i &apos;m feelin &apos; alright
gonna let it all hang out
wanna make some noise , really raise my voice
yeah , i wanna scream and shout
de @-@ de @-@ de , de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ de , uh
no .. morning , sheldon . come dance with me .
no .
why not ?
penny , while i subscribe to
the &quot; many worlds &quot; theory which pots the existence
of an infinite number of sheldons
in an infinite number of universes ,
i assure you that in none of them am i dancing .
are you fun in any of them ?
the math would suggest
that in a few i &apos;m a clown made of candy .
but i don &apos;t dance .
alright , want some french toast ?
it &apos;s oatmeal day .
tell you what , next french toast day , i &apos;ll make you oatmeal .
dear lord , are you still going to be here on french toast day ?
morning .
look , leonard ,
penny made french toast .
sorry i haven &apos;t given her your schedule yet .
it &apos;s an ical download .
she can put it right in her phone .
and i thought we agreed
that you &apos;d have your conjugal visits in her apartment .
we did , but there were extenuating circumstances .
i see .
did her abysmal housekeeping skills
finally trump her perkiness ?
no , her bed kind of ... broke .
that doesn &apos;t seem likely .
her bed &apos;s of sturdy construction .
even the addition of a second
normal size human being wouldn &apos;t cause a structural failure ,
much less a homunculus such as yourself .
a homunculus ?
perfectly formed miniature human being .
oh , you &apos;re my little homunculus .
don &apos;t do that .
sorry . okay , who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar ?
i want oatmeal .
yes , well
i want a boyfriend whose roommate isn &apos;t a giant pain in the ass .
i &apos;m sure that will happen soon enough .
but in the meantime , i still want oatmeal .
you know what , i give up .
he &apos;s impossible .
i can &apos;t be impossible , i exist .
i believe what you meant to say is ,
&quot; i give up , he &apos;s improbable . &quot;
sheldon , you really need to find a better way
of dealing with penny .
what am i supposed to do--
eat french toast on a monday ?
now , that would be impossible .
i &apos;m just saying , you can catch more flies with honey
than with vinegar .
you can catch even more flies with manure .
what &apos;s your point ?
it &apos;s a ...
boy , that does smell good .
too bad it &apos;s monday .
okay , kim the night manager went on maternity leave
and her husband &apos;s name is sandy , right ?
so get this--
her replacement is a woman named sandy
whose husband &apos;s name is kim .
wow !
i know !
what are the odds ?
easily calculable .
we begin by identifying a set of married couples
with unisex names .
we then eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work--
the aged , the imprisoned and the limbless , for example ,
next we look at ...
sheldon--
it &apos;s an amazing coincidence .
can we leave it at that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
ooh , penny . it &apos;s as if the cheese @-@ cake factory is run by witches .
ooh , sheldon , it &apos;s as if you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll punch you .
come on , you guys , let it go .
fine , whatever .
are you finished ?
well , thank you .
how thoughtful .
would you like a chocolate ?
um , yeah , sure .
thanks .
what was that ?
you said be nice to penny .
i believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of nice .
it does .
but in my experience , you don &apos;t .
there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio ,
than are dreamt of in your philosophy
now that &apos;s you
obnoxious and insufferable .
what &apos;s going on , day dwellers ?
oh , man , did the kiss army repeal &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; ?
no .
raj and i are going to a goth club in hollywood
to hang with the night people .
anybody want to come along ?
oh , wow , you &apos;re actually going out like that ?
no , no .
i &apos;m going out like this ...
howard , what did you do ?
they &apos;re called tattoo sleeves .
look .
i go them online ! raj got a set , too ..
fantastic , right ?
put them on , have hot sex with some freaky girl
with her business pierced , take them off ,
i can still be buried in a jewish cemetery .
you know , i &apos;ve always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub .
really ?
bazinga !
none of you ever see my practical jokes coming , do you ?
okay , how about you two ?
look , i &apos;ve got some extra tatoo sleeves .
why are you carrying extras ?
in case i snag one on someone &apos;s nipple ring .
uh , yeah , i think we &apos;ll pass .
oh , is the missus speaking for the couple now ?
in this case , you bet she is .
yes , she &apos;s pushy , and yes , he &apos;s whipped ,
but that &apos;s not the expression .
come on , i want to stop at walgreens
and pick up some more eyeliner .
they &apos;re gonna get beaten up at that club .
they &apos;re gonna get beaten up at walgreens .
oh , sorry , sheldon .
i almost sat in your spot .
did you ? i didn &apos;t notice .
have a chocolate .
thank you .
i think we &apos;re fitting quite nicely .
it did help if you weren &apos;t drinking light beer .
what &apos;s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice ?
hello ? it looks like blood .
did you even read the &quot; wiki how &quot; link
i sent you on being goth ?
no , i &apos;m behind on my wiki @-@ reading .
i &apos;m kind of on a john grisham kick right now .
what ?
i finished reading the pelican brief
and loved it so much , i dived right into the client .
he was a lawyer himself ,
so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining .
just remember we are lost boys , children of the night .
great . lost boys , children of the night .
got it .
can you pass the chex mix please ?
thank you .
we are lost boys .
good for you .
i &apos;m actually much more lost than he is .
nice ink .
thanks .
can we buy you ladies a drink ?
two light beers .
light beers . &quot; wiki how &quot; about that ?
what &apos;s your names ?
i &apos;m howard . raj .
i &apos;m bethany .
nice to meet you , bethany .
yes , very nice .
nice to meet you , too .
i &apos;m sarah .
not that anyone cares .
do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of john grisham ?
what &apos;s this cartoon called again ?
oshikuru : demon samurai .
demon it &apos;s not a cartoon .
it &apos;anime .
anime .
you know , i knew a girl in high school named anna may .
anna may fletcher .
she was born with one nostril .
then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three .
you &apos;re here a lot now .
oh , am i talking too much ?
i &apos;m sorry . zip .
thank you .
chocolate ?
yes please .
oh . hey , kim .
you know what , hold on .
let me take this in the hall .
you &apos;ll never guess who they got to replace you at work .
okay , i know what you &apos;re doing .
really ?
yes , you &apos;re ung chocolates as positive reinforcement
for what you consider correct behavior .
very good .
chocole ?
no , i don &apos;t want any chocolate !
sheldon ,
you can &apos;t train my girlfend like a lab rat .
actually , it turns out i can .
well , you shouldn &apos;t .
there &apos;s just no pleasing you , is there , leonard ?
you weren &apos;t happy
with my previous approach to dealing with her ,
so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques ,
building on the works of thorndike and b.f. skinner .
by this time next week ,
i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool ,
balancing a beach ball on her nose
no , this has to stop now .
i &apos;m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool .
i thought the &quot; bazinga &quot; was implied .
we &apos;re just tweaking her personality .
sanding off the rough edges , if you will .
no . you &apos;re not sanding penny .
are you saying that i am forbidden
from applying a harmless , scientifically valid protocol
that will make our lives better ?
yes . you &apos;re forbidden .
bad leonard .
so , what do you guys do ?
oh , you know , goth stuff .
goth magazines , goth music .
goth food .
what &apos;s goth food ?
uh . blackened salmon ?
no , i meant what do you do for jobs ?
oh , we &apos;re scientists .
yeah , you know , the dark sciences .
what are the dark sciences ?
we ...
well , i am an astrophysicist ,
and a lot of that takes place at night .
when there are vampires
and miscellaneous undead out and about .
that sounds really cool .
does it ? okay . if you like space stuff ,
i design components for the international space station ,
which is in space .
where , as i &apos;m sure you know , no one can hear you scream .
so , what do you gals do ?
i work at the gap .
really ? how about that ? i &apos;ve been to the gap .
i &apos;ve been there , as well .
i like your t @-@ shirts with the little pocket .
i work the , too . not that anyone cares .
you know , this place is boring .
yeah why don &apos;t we go somewhere else and have some fun ?
okay .
sure we like fun .
we are fun people .
dark and fun .
come on . i know a place you &apos;ll really dig .
did you bring the black condoms ?
in my fanny pack .
let &apos;s go .
are you happy now ?
not particularly
my god , she didn &apos;t !
what could she possibly be talking about for so long ?
obviously , waitressing at the cheesecake factory
is a complex socioeconomic activity
that requires a great deal of analysis and planning .
&quot; bazinga . &quot;
you know , using positive
reinforcement techniques , i could train that behavior
out of her in a week .
no .
if you let me use negative reinforcement ,
i can get it done before we go to bed .
you &apos;re not squirting her in the face with water .
no , of course not .
we &apos;re talking very mild electric shocks .
no tissue damage whatsoever .
forget it .
oh , come on . you can &apos;t tell me
that you &apos;re not intrigued out the possibility
of building a better girlfriend .
i &apos;m not .
well , and penny &apos;s qualities , both good and bad ,
are what make her who she is .
you mean , like that high @-@ pitched , irritating laugh ?
you wouldn &apos;t prefer a throaty chuckle ?
you &apos;re not changing how penny laughs .
no , that would be incongruous .
i was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register .
ugh . sorry , guys .
that girl is freaky .
come again ?
freaky .
freaky ?
ah , freaky .
have a chocolate .
thank you .
are you seriously going to damage your body
just for the possibility you could have cheap sex
with a strange girl you met in a bar ?
yeah !
what is your mother going to say ?
she &apos;s not going to see it .
she takes my temperature orally now .
what are you going to get , howard ?
well , i can &apos;t really decide
between a screaming devil , this mean little skull ,
or kermit the frog .
kermit the frog ? you know .
hi @-@ ho . i &apos;m on howard &apos;s butt .
get the mean little skull ,
and i &apos;ll see if i can make him smile .
yeah , i &apos;d like the mean little skull , please .
what are you going to get , raj ?
with my luck , hepatitis .
okay , here we go .
that &apos;s just rubbing alcohol .
i know , but it was cold .
i &apos;m putting on the stencil .
what comes after the stencil
okay , that &apos;s it .
no needle . no pain . no tattoo .
what &apos;s the big deal ? you &apos;ve done this before .
no , i haven &apos;t .
look .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a fraud .
he &apos;s a fraud .
we &apos;re both frauds .
yeah , i think i covered that .
but i was summing up .
we &apos;re not goth . we &apos;re just ... guys .
very , very smart guys .
so you were totally scamming us ?
yes .
and i wouldn &apos;t blame you if you
walked out of here and never wanted to see us again .
unless , of course , our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive
huh ? huh ? anything ?
i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;m leaving , too . not that anyone cares .
when we tell this story , let &apos;s end it differently .
what are you thinking ? maybe a big musical number ?
well , i &apos;m going to make some warm milk and then turn in .
i trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities ,
you &apos;ll keep the decibel level to a minimum .
of course .
thank you .
mmm . these are so good .
unbelievable .
what ?
i @-@ i was just thinking we should probably turn in , too .
well , you know , my new bed got delivered . if you come over
and put it together , you can stay at my place .
really ? that &apos;s a lot of work , and it &apos;s kind of late .
yeah , but if we stay there , we won &apos;t have tbe quiet .
let &apos;s go .
interesting .
sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior .
i wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that .
okay , wait . how about this ?
we say there were four goth girls .
the two girls in the club have two friends .
i like it , i like it .
did they smell good despite their goth @-@ like nature ?
what &apos;s that got to do with the story ?
engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me .
fine , they smelled good
oh , they did . like jasmine and honeysuckle
whatever .
and then they held hands and did a sexy , demonic hokey pokey for us .
no , no . ok , let me just say my story all the way through
and then you can say yours , and then we &apos;ll pick .
i &apos;m sorry . go on .
okay . we got tattoos ,
and then the four girls took us to their place
but we don &apos;t have tattoos.e.
what if someone asks to see our tattoos ?
we say they &apos;re in a very intimate area .
oh , we &apos;re bad boys , aren &apos;t we ?
right , right .
so , we go back to their place
and then the six of us end up in a hot tub .
but we just got tattos .
wouldn &apos;t we be concerned about bacterial infection ?
true . okay . forget the hot tub .
the point is , we each had a ménage with sexy goth girls .
what a great night .
yeah .
hey , want to try a country bar tomorrow night ?
maybe we &apos;ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls .
could happen .
