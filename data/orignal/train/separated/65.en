The evidence does not support the finding
that my client is guilty of premeditated murder.
Alicia? Alicia?
Alicia?
Your Honor, the trial is over.
The jury has heard the evidence.
The arguments now are purely about
your jury instructions, that's all...
And that's what we're arguing, Your Honor...
Mr. Agos?
I know that interruption is a standard trope
of today's modern discourse,
but do you happen to remember what I said about it?
You said you didn't like it.
Yes. If you did it again?
I was gonna have to go sit down.
That's right.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The prosecution worries they failed to
make their case for first-degree murder.
We sympathize.
We don't think they made their case, either.
Our client is innocent.
Officer Fisher didn't kill her husband.
She didn't take her service revolver
and shoot him in the head.
Yes, I see your hand, Counselor.
Are you finished, Ms. Lockhart?
Yes, I am, Your Honor.
The defense is forcing the jury
into an all-or-nothing deliberation--
first-degree murder or not guilty.
You're the ones who fought the all-or-nothing prosecution...
Mr. Coyne.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The evidence at trial is what should guide your decision.
The jury heard evidence
from which they could reasonably conclude that the elements
of second-degree murder have not been met...
Ms. Venegas. Yes.
Yes, I received your message, ma'am.
I'm so sorry, but we can't accommodate you.
We limit enrollment to the beginning of the year.
I understand. It's just...
I know occasionally you make exceptions.
For legacy students, yes.
My children were students at your elementary school
before my husband and I moved away.
He's the new State's Attorney, you know.
Oh, Peter Florrick?
I wasn't making the connection.
Yes, and he would be thrilled if we could work this out.
Let's just meet to discuss.
Certainly. But you understand I can't make any promises.
Oh, yes, I understand. Does tomorrow at 10:00 work?
Great!
Thank you so much, Ms. Venegas. I'll see you then.
Peter, hi.
I set up a meeting with the headmistress at Capstone.
Really? I thought they said no.
They did, but they're open to a meeting,
and it wouldn't hurt if you gave them a call.
She seemed... persuadable.
When is the meeting?
it's tomorrow at 10:00, but you don't have to go.
I'll go.
Okay.
Tomorrow at 10:00.
And... I think she liked the State's Attorney thing, so...
I'll play it up. Okay?
All right, bye.
What happened?
The judge won't instruct on second-degree murder.
It's Judge Dunaway. You said he leaned toward the prosecution.
He used to.
Where's the jury on this?
I don't think we convinced them of first degree.
You agree?
I think the jury likes her.
I don't think we made the sale on premeditation.
So, why didn't we?
We had a witness that fell through.
And some of the motions... they just didn't go our way.
Make the deal.
They'll want manslaughter.
Manslaughter, no. Second degree, four years.
Where the hell are all the tough-on-crime judges these days?
Mr. Gardner.
One second.
I don't want things to be awkward.
I so don't want things to be awkward.
Good. Then they won't be.
So, that's it then, isn't it?
What?
We just decide it, and it's so?
Yep. We're adults.
Alicia?
Looks like you're needed.
Then I'll get back to work.
Thank you.
You have no reason to thank me, Alicia.
No reason at all.
I have these discovery documents
for you to go over...
Well fought, Cary.
You've become quite the litigator.
Thank you, Diane. We try to keep you guys honest.
So, we have an offer.
We probably should hurry, or the jury will be in soon.
Second degree, four years.
Diane, you still there?
Yes, I'm here.
We're just thinking it over.
We'll take it to our client.
But she'll be much more inclined if you offer probation.
It's not going to be probation.
She killed her husband for the insurance money.
He committed suicide.
Come on, he committed suicide
with her service revolver...?!
Too bad you couldn't shake the alibi.
Okay, let's not go over this again.
We'll, we'll take it to our client, Cary.
That's all we can say.
Okay, do.
Just know you're not getting any better than this, okay, Diane?
Bye.
Yes!
Yes!
Oh! Oh, well done!
They're offering second-degree murder.
Four years.
Four years?
The statutory minimum.
You'll be out in one.
It's good news, Lauryn.
They're worried about their case;
that's why they're making an offer.
So I should wait for a verdict?
I don't know. Juries are unpredictable.
You're not saying much.
I don't have much to say.
Well, what should I do?
A year in prison or roll the dice with a verdict?
I think... that you need to make that decision, Lauryn.
You can't defer to anyone else.
You know what you did; you know what you didn't do.
You also know sometimes that doesn't matter.
It comes down to two things: the skill of your lawyers,
and the jury.
You have good lawyers.
The trial went our way, but the jury...
is an unknown.
They're your peers.
And I've never understood my peers.
I didn't do this.
That's why I'm going to pass on this deal.
I can't spend another day in prison for something I didn't do.
I'll roll the dice.
Okay.
Then we sit and wait for the jury.
Oh, yeah, I talked with that headmistress.
She's a real piece of work.
So, we'll split the cost.
No, I've got it.
We're going to split the cost of private school, Alicia.
That's non-negotiable.
Okay, thanks.
Where are we at with Grace?
No TV, no computer except homework.
No calls except to us.
And no calling Jimmy Patrick.
That's that Christian kid she was with?
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.
Oh, no, no, no, I'll talk to him.
No, I will.
I'm just bringing my computer for my homework.
Dad is keeping track.
Yeah, and Dad's a lot meaner than Mom.
Dad, do I get to drive?
Call me on your way to school tomorrow.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you.
See ya.
Joan of Arc, as only cable can tell it.
If only the Armagnacs and the Burgundians
would unite under one leadership.
Does Monsieur want me to wash between the legs?
Oui.
But then there's Burgundy,
and this insufferable peace treat...
Hi, it's me.
I know I shouldn't have called...
Are you sure? It's not too late?
Hey, sis.
You're lonely. That's the problem.
I'm lonely. I know I'm lonely.
So go call him.
Who?
Will.
Owen, you're not listening to me.
I have kids.
You don't have kids. They're with Peter.
What?
Do you suddenly become a non-sexual person
just because you have kids?
No. I am a parent.
And I have to stop being irresponsible.
How are you being irresponsible?
I'm married.
Then get divorced.
You're not Catholic.
Nobody's gonna send you to hell.
Are you in love with Will?
No, I don't think I am.
Seriously?
Seriously.
I think I was in love with "It."
You know, the attention.
The...
Raw, animalistic sex?
Yeah.
But... I didn't like the lying.
And I... and I don't like... I mean, he's my boss.
Then quit.
I don't mean quit working.
I mean, quit that job. Get another one.
It's too complicated. I don't like complications.
I need friends.
Then get friends. You-you had good friends.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Where are they all?
Probably on Facebook.
What about... try that tennis woman,
what was her name?
It was like a governmental agency... FEMA?
Senna.
She was nice, wasn't she?
Oh, this can't be good.
Hello.
Now?
I'd like to thank the jury for their diligence
and insisting on staying past dinner.
I understand we have a verdict.
We do, Your Honor.
Mr. Foreman, you may read the verdict.
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Lauryn Fisher, guilty of murder in the first degree.
No.
Get Kalinda; she's on her way in.
Kalinda, it's guilty.
Your Honor, we ask...
Would you like me to poll the jury?
Yes, Your Honor.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the defense would like to make certain
that all members of the jury support this verdict,
so I will ask you one at a time for your individual verdicts.
It isn't over, Lauryn, not by a long shot.
Juror number one, what is your verdict?
Guilty.
Actually, sir,
you have to say, "Guilty of murder in the first degree."
Sorry.
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Juror number two, what is your verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Juror number three, what is your verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Juror number four, what is your verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Juror number five, what is your verdict?
I...
Guilty of murder... in the first degree.
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
Juror number six, what is your verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Juror number 12,
what is your verdict?
Not guilty of...
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
Well, thank you, jurors, that ends your service.
We will reconvene on Friday for sentencing.
Good night.
The judge is not happy.
I know, we may have an opening.
Lauryn, this isn't over yet.
We can try and get this overturned.
Or a mistrial or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
I've never seen anything like it.
That verdict doesn't make sense.
Something happened in the jury room.
I got to get moving.
Right.
We want a reversal, something before sentencing on Friday.
We have a sympathetic judge.
All right, let's find out what went wrong.
陪审团休息室
Thanks, Brad.
It will be put to good use.
Sorry to bother you.
You might recognize me from the defense.
Yes.
It really helps us evaluate our performance
to hear from the jurors
what they think we did right and wrong,
so if you don't mind talking...
I don't think I'm supposed to.
Oh, no, that's just during the trial.
You have the right to say anything you want after the verdict.
This isn't over.
What's now?
They're out talking to jurors.
They're going for a reversal.
Or judgment notwithstanding.
It's just kind of late.
I understand.
Why don't I just take your number
and I'll call you tomorrow?
Ten minutes tops.
You don't have to talk to her.
He's well within his rights, Cary.
I explained to him.
Yes, but have you explained
that he don't have to talk to you at all?
Just so you know, sir, defense attorneys will try
and contact you and question you in an attempt
to compromise your verdict.
I'm doing nothing wrong, Cary.
Here's my number if they do.
You can bring them up on charges of harassment.
What are you doing there, Kalinda?
How are you, Dana?
I was just enjoying the night air.
It looked to me like you were taking pictures
of the jurors' license plates.
Really?
I thought I was taking notes
that are both legally obtainable
and legally obtained.
I'm warning you now, Kalinda.
If any of those jurors call harassment on you,
I will personally toss you in jail.
I feel warned.
Thank you.
Last on the voting all 12 guiltys,
and my guess-- this would be dinner.
Here's a not guilty.
And another.
Second-to-last round-- looks like we had
two holdouts.
Ugh, Chinese.
Oh, looks like we hit lunch.
Not guilty
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
9 Not guilties in that round.
We went from nine not guiltys to ten guiltys
in one round of voting?
And that was just after lunch.
What happened at lunch?
This is a livery horn button, 1840s,
perfect backmark.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Do you collect buttons?
No, but I sure can see the fascination for them.
I guess I'm a bit obsessed.
That's what everybody says
I have my own button blog
Lisa's World of Buttons-- all one word.
You must blog a lot.
Oh, yeah,
I'll go crazy if I don't blog twice a day
crazier than I already am now.
Do you mind if I just record this just for my own notes?
Sure, no problem, but I don't see how I can help.
Well-- thank you-- you seemed,
you seemed really upset
by the verdict.
Did you feel the pressure to vote with everyone else?
Oh, no,
no, just don't like to get up in front of people.
I get a little bit dramatic.
That must have looked awful.
I cry at the drop of a hat.
So you, you don't regret the verdict?
Oh, no, no, I didn't trust that lady.
She killed her husband for the insurance money.
I can't think of anything worse.
You must have made a...
made a very convincing case to the other jurors
to get them to change their vote.
I understand...
That is beautiful, isn't it?
I understand the vote was leaning toward not guilty.
Yeah, for a while.
Am I supposed to talk about this?
Oh, the other jurors did.
They said at they changed their minds just after lunch.
What happened during lunch?
Nothing-- I mean, we read the testimony.
The foreman thought we should.
What testimony?
The partner, the other cop,
the one who said he was with her.
The alibi witness-- you didn't believe him?
Nah, he was so full of himself in that uniform.
Would you like to see a 1780
Georgian Irish militia button?
Mint condition. Mint
Sergeant Alden?
He was our best witness.
I know. She didn't believe him.
They reread his testimony just after lunch,
and that's what turned people toward guilty.
That makes no sense.
You might also want to get someone to check her blog:
Lisa's World of Buttons.
She's on that twice a day.
She might have updated during the trial.
Good. Alicia, can you get on that?
Yeah, in about a half hour.
where are you, Alicia?
A prior engagement-- I'll be right in.
Kalinda, where are you going next?
The foreman-- he seemed open to talking.
Okay, good.
Stay in touch.
Uh, you, too, Alicia.
And, Alicia, uh, let's talk when you get back.
Okay.
Well, I do hope you consider
moving back to the neighborhood.
I'd love to, but you know civil servant pay.
Oh, my goodness, I do.
I used to teach public school-- social studies.
Sorry about that. Work.
Usually it's the husbands ducking out to take calls.
We take turns.
Anyway, I hope you'll make an exception for our kids
because I think you'll really love Zach and Grace.
Well, I'm sure I will.
I very much want to.
Let me see what I can do.
I forgot how good you were at that.
At what?
Charming the teachers.
It's the height-- they respect the height.
So are we going to let Zach drive all this way?
It's only another 20 minutes.
And Grace?
What about Grace?
She made a mistake.
I worry we screwed up our kids.
You worry that I screwed up the kids.
That's true.
What did you say?
I said it just seems odd.
Yeah, we sometime see split votes veering one way or the other,
but to have a complete turnaround
leaning from not guilty to guilty
in a matter of hours just seems odd.
I guess I must be odd then
because I was voting not guilty.
Until you read the testimony of the alibi witness?
Yes, I mean, it just didn't seem to hold up.
I think when you have a policeman there
in uniform in person, you get persuaded,
but then when you read it out loud,
you start to see the holes.
Okay, Kalinda, that's it.
Hello, Cary.
I already warned you once.
You're under arrest.
For what?
Section 5324a.
Harassment of jurors.
Mr. Alvarez, am I harassing you?
It doesn't matter what he says.
He's a public employee, and his supervisor over there
is insisting you're preventing him from executing his duties
Are you serious?
I'm very serious.
Please place your hands behind your back.
You know this won't stand up.
I know you'll be out of circulation for a day or two.
Hey, what's up?
They supposedly have something for a mistrial.
When?
Right now.
Get in here.
Good, there you are, as a lodge.
The defense claims to have evidence of jury misconduct.
The defense is desperate, Your Honor.
At a certain point, justice has to be done...
It's being done-- this is how justice works.
What do you have, Ms. Lockhart?
Improper contact between a juror and nonparticipant
is considered jury misconduct, Your Honor.
Discussing a case
with friends, relatives
during the trial or deliberations.
One of our jurors has done just that.
Which juror?
Juror number five--
Lisa Banner.
She's written on her blog
during deliberations.
Oh, come on.
"You're probably wondering why I've been away for a few days.
"I'm on jury duty-- a murder.
I know it's supposed to be exiting
I think she meant "Exciting."
Oh, I'm sure she did.
..."but you can't believe how long this is taking.
"I sit in this room staring at these people
who can't make up their minds."
Yes, I'd imagined you'd have something to say, Ms. Lodge.
Your Honor, Ms. Banner
has broken a key rule of deliberations.
She has discussed the case
with those outside of the jury.
Her blog received 45,000 individual hits on the day in question,
so Ms. Banner shared her views
with 45,000 non-jury members.
God, how I hate that word "Blog."
Ms. Lodge.
Your Honor,
this gives new meaning to reaching.
That blog entry was generic,
unspecific, and unknowing.
I regrettably agree, Ms. Lockhart.
Ms. Banner's banal observations hardly rise to
the level of improper contact,
though I'd love to jail her for syntax alone.
Your Honor, we would argue that you censure the defense.
They are sifting through personal lives of juries
on a fishing expedition for a mistrial.
No, Ms. Lodge, this was an unjust verdict.
You know that and I know that.
That's not true.
It is true,
but the law was followed, Ms. Lockhart.
I would love to overturn this, but you have to give me more.
Your Honor, I would like to get your comments on the record.
They are on the record. That's what Judith is doing over there.
what'd I just say, Judith?
"They are the record. That's what Judith is doing over there."
Bring me something more, Ms. Lockhart.
The law is the law.
Yes?
You know our investigation
into Lockhart/Gardner?
I think I may have stumbled upon another judge they bribed.
Come on in.
I was so thrilled when you called.
I've been wondering how the old friends are doing.
You're not in touch with anyone?
No, when I got divorced, I moved across town.
How you and Peter doing?
Well.
Good, great.
You're our Bill and Hillary.
Have you heard of Mosous?
The...?
Mosous.
They're these people in Southwest China
who organize their lives around a woman's sexual desire.
Oh, no.
Th-They completely separate sex from family.
The Mosou women get to decide which men they'll sleep with,
how long, how many.
All these Mosou men come knocking on the door
of their Babahougas at night--that's their flower rooms--
and the women decide which ones to let in.
And when they're done, it's up to the women whether the men stay or go.
And that's when I realized--
that's what I'm missing from my life.
Control. You have to read this book.
It'll open your eyes.
So, how are you doing?
Good.
So, try one of your other tennis buddies, they can't all be like that.
Yeah, but what if are?
What if I have spent a decade of my life making the wrong friends?
Start making new ones. Nothing's over till it's over.
Well, thank you.
I have to go yell at someone now. Talk to you later.
Hello.
Hi. I'm Grace's mom.
I already talke to Grace.
I don't want her to contact you again,
and I don't want you contacting her. Do you understand?
I do.
But just so you know, Mrs. Florrick,
I thought she had your permission.
She didn't. And she doesn't.
Okay.
But she really should be going to church.
That's up to me.
That is not up to you.
I don't want you contacting her again.
She already told me. Don't worry.
You talked to Grace?
No, I mean, your assistant already told me.
My assistant?
The one who came for Grace at the church.
The one who ripped into me.
What are you talking about?
Your assistant at work. Kalinda.
Kalinda?
She...
I don't understand.
She came and got Grace .
And said I should never talk to her again
or she would hurt me.
She... I...
I don't understand how did...
how did she find Grace?
Mom, she told us not to say anything.
Yes, but now I'm telling you to say something. What happened?
She used some software to trace Grace's cell phone,
but it was dead, so she..
drove to see where Grace was.
And why didn't she want you to tell me?
I don't think she thought you wanted to know.
Mom, I have to get to class.
Listen, Zach...
Zach... I'm not angry,
but we don't keep things from each other?
Okay. Sorry, Mom.
That's okay. We'll talk later. I love you.
"Be sorry."
Thank you, Alicia, for dropping by.
We just don't talk as much as we used to.
Well, it's, uh, been very busy.
And you've... been distracted.
Well, I was just dealing with some home issues,
but that's all taken care of now.
Good.
You're valuable to us, Alicia.
When I worked with, Stern years ago, we were... very close.
And as a woman, it was very helpful
to be that closely associated to a powerful man.
But only to a point.
People tended not to give me credit for my own successes.
All I'm trying to say is,
women need to help women--
the way you're helping Caitlin;
the way I am here to help you.
I want you to get serious about the partner track.
Really?
Yes.
I've been watching you. You have it in you.
But you can't get distracted.
Not with family, not with... friendships here.
You have to keep your eye on the ball.
I can't change that I have a family.
No one wants you to.
But rising to a certain level as you have,
Alicia, there are only two paths open to you now:
rising further or falling to earth.
And that's why I want to help you,
to offer you my friendship... and my advice.
Okay.
I got something from the jury room.
Oh good, more from the trash.
Nah, a threat. From one juror to another. Look.
"Change your vote or you'll be sorry"?
But the problem is, we can't use this.
Yeah, we're not supposed to even have this trash.
Can we tell who it was written by?
Or to? I mean, if-if we could question these jurors,
we could get it independently.
We could compare the handwriting.
Good. Where is Kalinda?
She was arrest.
When?
An hour ago. A friend at the courthouse just called me--
she's g held on a juror harassment charge.
Okay, well, let's bail her out.
I'll do it.
Are you sure?
Yes. I'll go.
Thank you for seeing me.
You're welcome, Ms. Scott-Carr.
Not sure what I can do for you.
Well, Your Honor,
I've been assigned a case involving judicial corruption.
Really?
Yes.
And I was wondering, as a part of my investigation,
has any lawyer approached you about a bribe?
No, no lawyer has.
Good. That's... that's good to know.
Now, you know that bribes are not always...
in the form of cash. They can often be in form of gifts,
or even the forgiving of debts.
Harvard Law Review.
This is...
my article
on judicial misconduct.
Worth a read sometime.
Please don't confuse my meaning,
Your Honor.
Due diligence requires some uncomfortable questions.
Yes. And so does undue influence.
Are you suggesting that I'm influencing you?
No, I'm suggesting you're attempting to influence me.
You were close with Will Gardner.
You used to play in his wednesday night basketball games.
We've pinpointed these games as a prime nexus
for illegal gambling and bribery.
And I am friendly to his partner,
Diane Lockhart,
in her current case-- isn't that what you're suggesting?
Yes.
And you...
are attempting to use your position as a special prosecutor
to pressure me to decide for the prosecution
in this ongoing case.
Well... that's where you're wrong, sir.
There is no ongoing case.
The verdict is in.
How you doing?
'Cause you're looking a little pale.
Yep, hands behind your back.
Kalinda Sharma.
She was brought in a few hours ago.
Yes.
Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am,
but Kalinda Sharma has been transferred.
Where?
She took ill,
and she s transferred to a local hospital for treatment.
Come on. This is a game.
That's all I know, ma'am.
Take it or leave it.
Let me put this to you simply, Cary.
Unless you want a lawsuit the likes you've never seen,
I would stop this shell game with Kalinda.
Because I have three pro bono clients
who have suffered the same transferring of relatives and loved ones,
and if I can prove a systematic effort
to elude arraignment and bail hearings,
well, then we're talking about damages in the millions--
and more importantly,
I'll be naming you personally in that lawsuit.
Hi, Alicia.
I am not joking, Cary.
You bring Kalinda to me now.
Thanks.
You found Grace?
You found my daughter?
She wasn't lost.
You brought her home.
She would have come home on her own.
You told my kids not to tell me. Why?
I don't want mess.
What mess?
Alicia, I haven't changed.
I'm the same person.
I... I knew I could help, so I helped, that's all.
Thank you.
You don't have to...
No.
You didn't have to.
That'why I'm thanking you.
You're welcome.
Here we all are again.
What have you got for us today, Ms. Lockhart?
Juror number 12, Your Honor,
Mr. Grant Rudnick.
He has something he would to say.
Uh, yes. Your Honor
I'm sorry, I should have said this before.
This note was given to me
in the jury room.
Oh, come on,
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.
5324a, Your Honor:
jury tampering, or bullying,
falls well within the judge's right to declare a mistrial.
I know, I interrupted Mr. Agos.
I will go sit down now.
The jury's decided, Your Honor, and the defense
shouldn't be allowed to keep throwing crap against the wall.
Thank you, Mr. Agos,
but I think it's my job to figure out what is crap.
Mr. Rudnick,
did this threat changed your view of the case?
Your Honor, that's not the point. The mere fact...
Ms. Lockhart, I didn't ask you a question.
Mr. Rudnick... did this note change your mind about the case?
No.
So...
when I polled the jury in court and you said
"Guilty in the first degree," were you telling the truth?
I guess so, sure.
Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Coyne, again...
nice effort,
but I deny your request for a mistrial,
and I ask that you be more circumspect in the future
with your approaches to jury members.
Damn it!
What happened?
He's afraid to go out on a limb.
Who threatened you, Mr. Rudnick?
Who wrote that? The foreman.
I forget his name.
But it's not like to take it seriously.
I was just one of the holdouts.
And I think he just wanted to finish up that night.
What? I don't undersnd is,
the foreman was one of the "Not guilty" votes,
and then, after lunch, not only does he change his vote,
but he pressures another juror
to overturn his vote?
Kalinda, what are you doing?
Anything you want.
I'm on my way.
Three Deccan buttons,
all with irises.
Oh, I like the middle one especially.
Thank you. I do, too.
So, uh, did you talk much about the case during lunch?
No. We honored the judge's instructions.
And was Mario with you?
He's the foreman.
Most days he was during the trial.
But deliberations-- no.
He said he had to do something next door.
Next door to what?
Chopsticks Shack. We'd go there every day.
Do you remember what was next door?
He used a computer in an Internet cafe over lunch.
He had to pay with a credit card,
so, I was able to find out which computer he used.
And this is a cache of the searches that he did during the hour.
What was he looking for?
Articles on our alibi witness, Sergeant Alden.
What was it, a grudge?
No.
Alden shot an Hispanic youth in 2002.
Yup. He was cleared of charges,
but there was lot of controversy
because the youth was unarmed.
Many members of the Latino community accused him
of lying during the inquest.
And Sergeant Alden is black. Not a lot of love lost there.
So you think he changed his vote
when he realized it was the same officer?
Yeah. But I don't think he made the connection
until he was in the middle of deliberations.
He checked, and then, he persuaded the other jurors.
We need to take this to the judge.
No. We need more.
Why?
This is exactly what Judge Dunaway is talking about.
No, no, no. Something has changed there. We need more.
We could get affidavits from the other jurors.
If they'll swear that the foreman brought in outside evidence
to the jury room, that might work.
OK, I'm on it.
I'll help.
Hello. Alicia Florrick.
Mrs. Florrick.
I was hoping to get your voice mail.
I just wanted to apologize.
It doesn't look like it will work out for your kids after all.
Really? Why?
Well, first of all, I'm so sorry to disapoint you.
I'm just trying not to set an unfortunate precedent.
I hope you understand.
Mrs. Florrick? Hello?
Peter Florrick.
Hey.
Alicia.
What's the matter?
What?
All right, don't worry.
I'll handle it.
You back again. Didn't get enough of my buttons.
Uh, this is my colleague, Alicia Florrick.
You might recognize her from the trial?
Yes. Hi.
I always liked what you were wearing.
Miss Banner, hi.
We were trying to get in touch with some of the other jurors.
We've talked to three or four, and we were just wondering
if you had the names or numbers of the others.
I do. I friended them all
so we could stay in touch.
I'm having a display of my buttons
at the Indiana State Fair,
and I wanted to keep them all in touch.
Here. Here you go.
Not all wanted to be friended,
but that's half of them anyway.
Thanks. This is so helpful.
Oh, Miss Banner?
Lisa.
Lisa, is that Peter Dunaway? Judge Dunaway?
Yes, I sent him a friend request, too.
He seemed like such a nice man.
And he friend you back?
Yes. Why?
During the trial?
Yes.
What's wrong?
I think we have our mistrial.
I never used to bite my nails.
Now look at them. They're bleeding.
We have some hope.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming by.
No.
I'm sorry.
When you asked me for my advice before
about whether you should take the deal or not,
I'm afraid... I was abrupt with you.
It was the truth.
No. I mean, it was,
but... sometimes, the truth can be more...
adorned.
I don't have a lot of friends coming by to see me.
I thought I would. I have a lot of friends.
This really gets you thinking about
how people say nice things and smile,
and then never came to visit.
I think I can do with things less... adorned.
I hope this works out.
I do, too.
Oh. Mr. Florrick.
Hello. How are you?
Good, ma'am. Very good.
I-I wish you'd made an appointment.
I just spoke to your wife.
Unfortunately, we don't have any room for your two children,
but I was saying, beginning next year,
At the start of next year, we should have room.
You know what one of the advantages
of my position is, Ms. Venegas?
No. I...
I imagine there must be many.
No, not really.
But background checks--
through background checks-- are one of the great advantages.
As I was perusing through some of these background checks,
I was somewhat surprised to find
that many of your teachers had... issues.
Of course, I was only checking as a concerned parent
who was thinking of sending his children here.
Luckily, there were no sexual charges.
But there were quite a few felony DUIs,
check kiting and... drug charges.
You are the State's Attorney, sir.
Yes, ma'am, I am.
That's why I'm going to say this to you...
very slowly.
I'm the State's Attorney.
You don't say no to me.
And you especially don't say no to me
when it concerns my children.
Do you understand?
I think the word you're looking for is "Yes."
Good.
So...
we'll be hearing from you.
Are we thinking the third time is the charm, Ms. Lockhart?
That is our hope, Your Honor.
Well, I should warn you.
My patience is running thin.
The Illinois Code of Judicial Conduct.
"Judges should refrain from all individual connect
"with a juror outside the presence of court
during a trial and deliberations."
Yes. Have you detected some contact I made with jurors?
You friended one.
Juror number five, Lisa Banner,
the blogger of Lisa's World of Buttons.
I didn't friend her.
You did, Your Honor.
She sent you a friend request three days ago,
and you responded in the affirmative.
Because I'm running for re-election.
Somebody friends me, I assume it's a supporter.
Your Honor, this is...
I know this is.
Your Honor, this is serious grounds for a mistrial.
Unknowingly or not,
you made contact with a juror
during the trial.
This is a serious ethical breach.
I used to find this job eternally enlightening,
even enjoyable.
Not anymore, not a single day.
Your Honor...
No.
I declare a mistrial.
Let's take it back into court,
make it official.
Good job.
That's what I was talking about.
That'll get you partnership.
So you chased them all away?
I don't believe I did anything of the kind, Mr. Gardner.
They found the better part of valor.
Here's your problem.
You don't have any evidence, lady.
You have accusations.
And you're trying to sweat me.
Well, I don't sweat easily.
Then let's talk.
That's all I want to do.
Just talk.
I'm not after you.
I don't think you know who you're after.
Oh, I know who I'm after.
Somebody who used to be involved in your basketball games years ago.
Who are you talking about?
Peter Florrick.
That's right.
It all comes full circle, doesn't it?
Only in Cook County.
Peter puts you in charge of an investigation into me,
and you turn it back on him.
I...
I'm speechless.
Peter's clean this term,
but he wasn't his first term, was he?
And you know where his weaknesses lie.
Well, I know a lot of things.
Then let's talk.
No.
Yes.
It's the smart move.
No.
I'm hiring myself a lawyer...
and then we can talk.
The next we talk, it'll be in front of a grand jury.
