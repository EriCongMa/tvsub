Hey, hey, hey. Back up.
Back up. Easy.
Hands. Let me see your hands.
Nice and slow, get on the floor. Now.
Do it now! Get down!
Now.
I don't think so.
Ooh, I love that sound.
Y'all know the drill.
Turn around.
You enjoying that?
I'll show you what I enjoy.
Ooh, sweetheart, spread those open for me.
There you go.
Turn around.
Lookie here.
Officer Tillwell.
It's like that old joke.
Two pigs walk into a slaughterhouse...
Long way from Jersey, officers.
Pack it up, baby.
So...
we got a policy around here.
You walk in with a badge...
Leave in a bag.
So I'm gonna ask you one time:
How'd you find us?
The man asked you a question, didn't he?
No, no, no, Danny, you can't stop there.
Hey, you can't leave me hanging. Come on.
What happened next?
Hold on.
That's him.
Huh?
That's him. That's Farooq.
That's him!
Five-O! Farooq, stay where you are!
Stay on him! We'll box him off.
Get down!
Danny!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
What is it?
Steve, don't move.
Monkey, how we doing in there?
You almost ready to go?
Almost.
You know, you can always wait next door with a Boba.
A Boba? Uh, I don't know what a Boba is,
but I'm pretty sure I don't want one. Thank you.
Do you like it?
I don't like it.
I do not like it. I... I love it.
It is perfect.
It is beautiful. That is definitely the one.
That's fantastic.
Let me take a picture. You ready? Bing.
All right, I got it.
What was that for?
Thanks for being my date tonight.
I know how much you hate dancing.
I don't hate dancing.
I like dancing. I'm a dancing fool.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
What's the special occasion?
Uh, there's a father-daughter dance.
Like there's not enough opportunities in life
for me to embarrass myself.
You'll have a great time. She'll remember it forever.
Kids grow up so fast.
Oh, and you being all of 18 years old, you know this how?
Next thing you know, you'll be buying her a wedding gown.
Yeah, yeah, right after I take out
a second mortgage on my house,
if I actually owned a house.
Have a super day.
Thank you.
Hold on one second.
Don't give me that look.
We are going to the dance.
I promise 100%, okay?
Danny.
Thanks. Come on.
So I take it
this is not a kid dropping Mentos into his soda pop.
And not a gas leak, either.
A surfer on his way to Chun's Reef
saw an explosion from the road and called 911.
Look at this guy. He's like a kid in a candy store.
He thinks there's only one vic,
but he's got to put Humpty Dumpty back together again
before he can confirm it.
This is, uh, quite a puzzle you've got there, Max.
With very broken pieces.
The body sustained exceptional impact,
so I'm unable to confirm a cause of death or give you an I.D.
until I complete the, uh... assembly.
Understandable.
Oh, I trust your shopping expedition went well?
Oh, yeah, it was good.
Uh, we found something nice. Thanks for the suggestion.
Wonderful. I'll tell my niece it was a success.
Oh, please do.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I am short one right arm.
Right behind you.
Oh. Mahalo.
Uh, what else do we know?
Well, the house is a rental.
I'm trying to track down the owners,
but they're in Japan on business.
Also found a cell phone,
and I sent it over to the crime lab for processing.
Hey. What's up?
Heard you went dress shopping.
That's right.
There something I should know?
Something? Yeah, I like to wear dresses.
What, you always go for the cheap shot?
Subtlety doesn't work with you.
A hammer is always best.
I'm just hoping you got something
with a nice, plunging neckline
so you can show off that Chewbacca chest.
Oh, that's... that's funny.
For your information,
I had to buy a dress for Grace.
Uh, there's a father-daughter dance tonight.
Oh... but you can't dance.
Sure, I can dance. I just choose not to.
That's a smart move.
Excuse me?
You forget I saw you dance at my wedding, brah.
Yeah, the overbite shuffle.
I remember.
Oh, is everybody done with their cute critiques?
Okay, what are you looking at?
A fragment from the housing
of the explosive device.
Okay, does that device have a name?
Okay, Danny, you can't just walk into a bomb scene,
poke a few things around, stick a finger in the air
and say with any degree of certainty.
This is a high-velocity, peroxide-based explosive
moving at 17,500 feet per second.
Okay, that-that sounds pretty certain to me.
Yeah, I've had some experience in this area.
You see this white crystalline residue?
Take a whiff of that.
Okay, it smells like bleach.
Yeah, that's the hallmark of TATP, triacetone triperoxide.
It's highly explosive
and it's highly unstable.
I never heard of it.
I saw this a lot in the IEDs on the road to Kabul.
I mean, it's all over the Middle East.
Okay, if it's so big in the Middle East,
what is it doing here in Hawaii?
That's a good question.
Max?
Hey, want a hand with that?
I'm good, thank you.
By the way, Commander,
your olfactory receptors are quite exceptional.
What you smelled was indeed
TATP, triacetone triperoxide.
As far as explosives go,
it's, uh, quite a simple recipe.
You can practically get everything
from your local drugstore.
As you can see from my reconstruction,
the blast distribution pattern indicates
that the victim was hunched over the device
when it was inadvertently triggered.
Hunched over? So this idiot blows himself up
accidentally while trying to build a bomb?
Correct.
What about an I.D., Max?
I did get a hit on a DNA sample.
"Qaseem Ramzi"
There wasn't much on him that I could find.
Apparently, he was a radical student
expelled from Saudi Arabia
for engaging in antigovernment activities.
Okay, so Qaseem Ramzi, he comes over to the island,
he rents a place in the middle of nowhere,
he tries to build a bomb.
The question is: Does he work alone?
No. Terrorists don't work alone.
They... they work in cells.
That way, if one guy goes down,
his buddy comes in and finishes the job.
Okay, you just said the "T" Word.
Okay, does this look like the end of something to you?
Because to me, this is just the beginning.
Lieutenant Catherine Rollins,
assistant to Steve McGarrett.
How can I help you?
Did you ever think that maybe,
just maybe, I can't live without you?
No, no, she's way too smart to fall for that.
You really think I'm gonna fall for that?
See?
Where are you?
The Hilton.
Nice. Keeping busy?
Uh, no,
but that's the point of R & R, isn't it?
You've already tipped your hand by calling me,
so why don't you just show me your cards?
All right, here's a name to run down:
Qaseem Ramzi. R-a-m-z-i.
Guy came online after he was expelled from Saudi
for radical activities.
What's your interest?
He's here.
Here?
Well, I mean, he was here.
He blew himself up making a bomb in Liliha.
What, you think this is part of a larger plot?
I don't know yet,
but I got the governor on standby.
Now, listen, Catherine, this is really important.
I need you to get me all the intel
on Ramzi you can, okay?
Even rumors.
All right, I'm on it.
You gonna tell me?
Am I gonna tell you what?
What's going on in that head.
Okay, uh...
I am thinking about the fact that
this is a very dangerous world that we live in.
We got nut jobs like Ramzi running around,
and at the same time, I am thinking about the fact
that I have a very beautiful daughter...
Yes, you do, and you're her father
and you love her, and...
and you try real hard to protect her.
That's my point.
Too little, too late, maybe.
What are you talking about, Danny?
I am talking about the fact
that Grace and every other kid her age
is growing up in Fortress America, right?
Whether Grace knows it or not,
she will have lived her entire life
under the threat of another attack.
Don't you think you're being a tad dramatic, Danny?
Absolutely not. I am not being dramatic at all, Steve.
I am simply stating a fact.
Because of one day,
because of one day,
my daughter will never know what it's like to board a plane
without being groped or harassed for 45 minutes.
Did you grow up like that? I didn't grow up like that.
No, I did not.
No, you did not,
and I... I never wanted that for my daughter.
I never wanted it for any kid.
That is not the way it is supposed to be. That's all.
We got a better fix on the bomb
that killed Ramzi while he was arming it.
The device was built to be controlled by a radio link,
so the actual bomber could be sitting
in a parked car a block away.
That's the same technology used against
Coalition Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Yeah, and whoever designed the thing
really knew what they were doing.
Any luck pulling any data off the cell phone
we found at the crime scene?
Yeah.
The lab pulled one readable bit
from the call history
made approximately 24 hours ago to a landline in Waipahu.
Address is 680 Malakeke Street.
Movement, movement.
Hey, hey! Do not move! Don't move!
Drop the weapon now. Hey.
Drop the weapon right now.
Don't move!
Go easy.
Put down the weapon now.
Drop the gun...
Drop it!
Are you guys okay?
Yeah.
This gun's not loaded.
Not loaded? So, what, he wanted us to kill him?
No. He didn't want to be taken alive.
Where's Chin?
Come with me.
What the hell is this, Santa's workshop?
Check this out.
Schools,
the HECO power plant at Kahe Point,
the airport.
Targets.
Okay, so we got bad guys on the island
with multiple choice of targets.
What do we think?
The power plant and the airport both have
A-plus security, right?
And they follow every DHS guideline
and they employ every physical enhancement.
But the softer targets like the schools,
they're going to be harder to defend against an attack.
Yeah, these guys want to make a statement.
They're gonna want the maximum amount of economic loss
with as many casualties as possible.
That's right. We need to alert these targets.
Chin, contact HPD.
Have them secure the locations.
Hey, Cath.
What do you got?
I pulled that intel you asked me for.
Check this out.
Recognize this guy?
That's Qaseem Ramzi.
And this guy.
Ayham Al Safi.
You know him?
Uh, kind of, yeah.
Short relationship.
When was this video taken?
Uh, 16 months ago in London.
It was part of an MI-5 surveillance op.
MI-5? What's their interest?
This guy right here.
Hasan Farooq.
Pakistani, educated in England.
Trained as an electrical engineer.
Ah. That comes in handy for building bombs.
Farooq is believed to have recruited his friends
Al Safi and Ramzi.
And now they're here.
Yeah.
If Al Safi and Ramzi are here on O'ahu,
you can be pretty sure that Farooq can't be far away.
Okay, if Farooq knows that his friends are dead,
maybe he will back off.
Or he'll become more determined.
Whatever the case, we need to find Farooq right away.
Guys.
They got something.
Okay, pull him back. Get him out of here.
Easy, easy, easy...
That's C-4.
That's enough C-4 to blow up an entire city block.
What's that red stuff?
That's flexible rubberized explosive.
There are serrated marks on the edge.
I'm guessing that's bad.
This is only half a roll.
So where's the other half?
No, Mom, listen.
Mom, I can't disclose that information to you.
You know that. You're a civilian now.
No, Rachel, I do not know when or where.
Don't you think that if I had that information,
I would share it with you?
Okay, well, fine.
Use that skill set to indentify a secure location
and stay there if necessary.
No, nothing.
Nothing. Please, do not tell her anything.
As far as she knows, I'm picking her up,
we're going to the dance just like we planned.
Mom, I have to go.
I have to go. Bye.
All right, just take care of yourselves,
and I'll call you as soon as I can.
Bye.
Rachel and Grace, they all right?
Yeah.
That was actually the first civil conversation
Rachel and I have had in several months.
Who knew that it would take the fear of imminent death
to make us cordial to one another?
That's nice.
Kono, what's up?
More intel on Ayham Al Safi.
Turns out he was using the alias "Randy Ramirez"
to rent the cottage he was living in.
He got a bogus I.D. and a credit card.
"Randy Ramirez" then used that card
to rent a Town Car from Premium Rentals.
Hey, listen, can you get a location on the car?
Farooq could be driving it right now to a target location.
I just talked to the rental company manager.
All their vehicles have an antitheft tracking device.
They gave me the log-in info.
I'm activating it now.
We got a hit.
You got an address?
T-100 Palm Circle Drive.
That's Fort Shafter.
That's the U.S. Army's Pacific Headquarters.
Guys, there's a retirement ceremony
for a three-star general on Palm Circle today.
The Secretary of Defense is attending the ceremony.
That's the target.
The entire Pacific military leadership in one spot.
Chin, notify HPD and the Army Bomb Squad.
Tell them we're looking at a major terrorist event.
You got that?
Copy.
Command, attention!
Present, arms!
Order, arms!
Parade, rest!
Aloha.
Thank you all for coming.
It's good to be with you here
on this beautiful morning,
and it's great to see
such an incredible turnout
here on historic Palm Circle
to help me honor my friend,
my old friend, General Krakower.
Now, before we bring out the rocking chair...
...first, I would like to acknowledge
the distinguished leaders of the United States Army,
civilian and military,
and the U.S. State Department, who are with us here today...
...as well as the leadership of our other services.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
You need to evacuate the area right now.
The entire area right now.
Get everybody out of there.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please calmly evacuate the field towards the front.
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Get out of here! Come on!
Everybody out! Come on! Out! Out!
Let's go! Go! Go!
Go! Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
Over here, over here!
Right here, right here, right here!
No Farooq.
No explosives.
Okay.
All clear.
Commander McGarrett, this GPS what you wanted?
Yes, sir. Thanks, Master Sergeant.
All right, Farooq drove the car here from an address in Waikiki.
We start there.
Farooq's gone.
Hey, Steve.
Found this upstairs.
Guys.
Farooq's fake documents.
Without them, he can't leave the country.
Looks like Farooq is planning to run.
Chin, notify HPD.
Kono, run facial recognition
through every security camera on the island.
Focus on commercial and noncommercial ports
and airfields, okay?
If you need more eyes, call Homeland Security.
All right, you got it.
All right.
You and me... we're gonna sit on this house.
Farooq's not going anywhere without this.
Monkey, what are you talking about? What do you think?
I bought you that dress for no reason?
We are going, okay?
You have Danno's 100% guarantee that we are going tonight.
Okay?
All right. I'll see you very soon, and I love you.
Okay, bye.
"Danno's 100% guarantee." Sounds serious.
Uh, father-daughter dance tonight.
Oh, right. Right, right, right.
I cannot miss it.
You're not gonna miss it.
Okay, well, don't jinx it.
How... I'm not... I'm not gonna jinx it.
Okay, well, don't say anything else about it.
You gonna wear a suit?
What'd I just say?
What did I just say?
You told me not to talk about the dance.
I'm talking about your wardrobe.
What I choose to wear
and tonight's dance are directly related.
Okay.
You know what I'd like?
I'd like one moment, one moment with my daughter
that is not affected by this job.
Borrowed time.
"Borrowed time"?
Borrowed time.
I got to keep reminding myself this is borrowed time.
What are you talking about?
This. Here. Me. Last ten years
of my life with my daughter-- it is borrowed time.
I was not supposed to have any of this.
Yes, yes, I am scared, all right?
I am also anxious and nervous.
I am discombobulated-- yes, I use that word.
But, most of all, I am happy.
Okay? Let me break it down-- I am 60% happy,
I am 30% completely terrified,
and I am 10% discombobulated.
Yes, it is a real word.
See? This is why you suck at Scrabble.
Okay, listen, I love you very much, Rachel,
and I will see you when I get home, okay? Bye.
You are having a bad day, my friend. Okay.
So, you get, uh...
get pulled over on the Turnpike-- busted taillight.
Got no I.D., no car insurance, so...
uniform runs your plates, finds out that the car is stolen.
Now... that is a big, dumb, ignorant rookie mistake, papi.
Always, and I mean always,
check the lights before you steal a car.
Okay, but... the plot thickens, okay?
The subsequent search of that car turns up
an unregistered firearm and $50,000 cash.
Now, I am positive, absolutely positive,
there is a reasonable explanation for all this,
so I am going to ask you, where did you get the money?
I just won the Pick-6, man.
And the gun?
Never seen it before.
Cops dropped it under my front seat
when they pulled me over.
Of course. You were, uh...
you were set up. I apologize.
Okay, so I'm gonna make this very simple for you--
you answer my questions, you cooperate,
then there's a small chance that you get out of prison
before you are middle-aged, all right?
So I'm gonna ask you again, where did you get the money?
Your mom gave it to me last night.
That's, uh... that's the wrong answer.
But it was good.
Uh, you know, normally,
I would bounce your head off of the steel table,
but you caught me on a good day. I'm in a good mood.
So, uh... you have a shot.
Excuse me.
Fingerprint results just came back.
Tell me this guy's got a sheet.
Oh, he's got a sheet.
Name's Nicky Bova.
Priors include aggravated assault, arson, burglary.
This guy's a three-strikes candidate.
What is he still doing on the street?
He's mobbed up.
Bova's uncle Lou is a capo for the DeAngelis family.
Right. Jersey's finest.
Cash was probably for a drug buy.
I dumped his phone-- found a voice mail
setting up a meet in the city
two hours from now, uptown by the bridge.
Good. Want to go crash a party?
I'll drive. I called it.
Can I drive my car once?
Is that so much to ask, huh?
No. No, no, no.
Danny, you can't stop there.
Come on, what happens next?
That's him. That's Farooq.
Five-O! Farooq! Stay where you are!
Get down!
Danny...
Stop, stop, stop.
What is it?
Steve.
Don't come any closer, all right? Stay right there.
Don't move. Don't move, don't move, don't move. Stop.
What?
What the hell is that?
It's a proximity sensor.
It's an infrared radiation beam that detects movement.
You have to stay completely still.
Okay, wh...
what if I can't stay completely still?
Then this bomb's gonna detonate.
You and me are both gonna die.
What's it doing?
It's okay, man. It's gonna identify the wires in the box
so they know what tools to send in with the guy.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay, so just breathe easy, pal. You're doing great.
Steve, I need you to do me a favor, okay?
What do you need?
I need you to call Grace.
Tell her I'm sorry, okay?
What are you sorry for?
Sorry for missing the dance.
But you're gonna make the dance, Danny.
Says you I'm gonna make the dance.
No, how about Danno's 100% guarantee? Remember that?
Yeah.
You gave that to her, okay?
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Just don't move.
Don't move. All right.
Want to hear something crazy right now?
Sure.
I'd kill for a Hank's Haute Dog.
Don't laugh.
Yeah, I bet you would, buddy.
All right, so you're in the warehouse, right?
The story-- it was just getting good. Let's go.
You were in the warehouse. What happened next?
You think, uh, that's supposed to take my mind off of things?
You got a better idea?
No, I don't got a better idea.
Now, I'm gonna ask you again, copper.
How'd you find out about this place?
Well, why are you here?
Uh, I'm here because I wanted...
to get a box of T-bones.
Does that hurt?
All right.
Forget the T-bones.
Let's have some baby back ribs.
Mighty tough.
This a tough guy.
He got a mouth on him, can take a hit.
Yeah, yeah, I can take a beating all day long, buddy.
All right, tough guy,
let's see how tough your partner is.
Now, look, pretty,
you tell me what I'm asking
and I don't have to mess up your pretty little face.
You feel like a tough guy, hitting a woman?
No. I just like hitting cops.
Little Ray, he's all yours.
I like... hitting cops, too.
Now, now, it doesn't have to be this way,
you know that, right?
It does have to be this way.
There's no other way.
Come on, who told you about this place?
A little bird.
Well, what's the birdie's name?
Uh, I can't tell you that,
because if I do,
you're gonna find him
and you're gonna kill him,
and there goes my star witness,
because when I'm done flipping him,
he's going to send you and these two clowns that work for you
and everybody you've ever done business with your entire life
to prison for a long time, you understand?
Now, that's insulting.
Yeah,
'cause this clown right here is my brother,
and apparently, you're sleepwalking,
so, Ray, will you please wake his ass up?
With pleasure.
Hmm, maybe the little birdie's name is on this paper.
Oh. Looks like somebody's about to be a daddy.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't know,
but he'll never find out.
You shouldn't have done that.
Now I promise I'm gonna hurt you.
Oh, you're gonna what? You're gonna hurt me?
Yeah, I'll be starting with Ray, but eventually,
you and I are gonna tangle, and when we do,
it's not going to be good for you,
you understand me?
All right.
Now, we know you don't want to die
'cause you're about to become a daddy,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance
to get rid of that smart ass,
and tell me what I want to know:
How'd you find out about this place?
Ray.
Hey, Ray?
Do me a favor. Will you work the back a little bit?
Feel a little tense.
Why can't we shoot him?
'Cause he's a knight.
A what?
This is a knight right here.
This ain't no damn knight.
No, no, you gotta...
you gotta take away all of that armor,
and take away the mask.
They look like old slick here.
But I think it's all an act to impress the ladies.
You know, a chivalry thing.
Right, tough guy?
But what's funny,
once you remove that from the equation,
they're nothing.
Grace!
Danny...
Grace, Grace...
Oh, you son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you.
You hear me? I'm... I'm gonna kill you.
Grace?
Grace? I'm gonna kill you.
Now, we both know that that's not going to happen.
Now, I was nice to your partner.
By the time I'm done with you,
you're going to be begging me to put you down.
So, I want you to think about your answer.
Because this one is for keeps, Jersey.
Who else knows we're here?
Uh, besides me and my partner?
The entire Newark Police Department.
Okay, you idiots don't know this,
but you are surrounded right now, okay?
Yeah, well, now you bleed.
Go check it out.
Billy!
You guys mind if I join you?
I've got a date with your friend here.
Good to see you, man.
Hello, darling.
What've we got?
C-4, ball bearings, nails...
This thing was built to make a big mess.
Okay, can we not talk about that now, please?
Don't worry, you're in good hands.
I guess I don't have to tell you to keep still.
No.
My buddy was just wrapping up a story here, right, Danny?
Don't let me stop you.
This shouldn't take too long.
So, Danny?
So, you and your partner,
I bet you didn't tell anybody where you were going, right?
No, of course not.
Grace?
Grace.
Grace, come on, Grace.
Grace. Grace.
Grace.
Hello, officer down here!
Help!
That was September 11.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
Hey, that's... doesn't sound good, buddy, huh?
It's not.
Someone was playing it cute with a fail-safe.
Okay, but you got this, right?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
All right, Steve, get out of here. Go on.
Forget about it.
He's right. You better go.
I said forget about it, all right?
Do me a favor and go, please.
If something happens,
I need you to take care of Grace. Now, go.
That's your job, pal.
Okay? You're her dad.
Done.
Done? Can I move? Done?
Clear.
Thank you.
I, uh... I'd offer to take you for a beer,
but I got somewhere I got to be.
Next time, right?
Yeah, next time.
Let's hope there's not a next time.
Thanks for sticking around, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, man, I got to go.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Are you okay, Danno?
You're okay, I'm okay.
Just thinking, monkey.
Was thinking about a certain day about 11 years ago,
the day I found out Mommy was pregnant.
Was that a good day?
Was it a good day?
It was the best day. Come on, give me a hug.
I need it.
Thank you.
We don't have to dance anymore if you don't want to.
Well, what did we come here for?
We came here to dance, right?
Come on, I may never stop.
Let's go, huh?
