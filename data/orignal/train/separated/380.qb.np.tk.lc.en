over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
hey ! please ! please ! let me show you !
this is 200 .
oh ! honey .
isn &apos;t this marvelous ?
for you , friends , special price , 300 dirham .
300 ? i &apos;ll give you 50 .
250 . sir , this is one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind .
okay , okay .
200 , but that is as low as i can go .
i will go hungry .
i know we said no souvenirs , but --
$ 20 .
isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
yes . yes , very beautiful .
you should listen to the lady . very smart woman .
sir , you &apos;re a lucky man .
yes , i am . 75 .
go with it . it &apos;s part of the bit .
ah , sir . you &apos;re twisting my arm .
okay . uh , 125 .
no , thanks .
this isn &apos;t the good stuff , anyway .
my friend , my friend . you are a wise man .
this cheap . it &apos;s for tourists .
you want to see real moroccan khimar ?
come .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
this way .
here , for you !
okay , people . time to head back to the ship .
no , no !
help !
no !
help !
gentlemen . please be reasonable .
now , we can find terms amenable to both sides .
but first , i need you both agree to a temporary détente .
they &apos;re children , matt . use words they can understand .
he started it !
he said baron von spacewarp
could kick captain freedom &apos;s b @-@ u @-@ t .
baron spacewarp is the most awesomest
space marshal in the universe !
is not !
is so !
uh , fbi train you for this ?
guys . the record is pretty clear .
spacewarp is the most imposing lawman of 2114 .
see ?
but captain freedom is awesome right now .
and i know that because i work for him .
you know what captain freedom would say
in a situation like this ?
no .
what ?
well , he would say --
good morning , simmons .
hey , cap .
we caught another case .
kidnapping in morocco .
yeah .
be right there .
evening , everyone .
hi , jack .
hey , jack .
this afternoon , peter and kate carson
of coeur d &apos;alene , idaho
were abducted in casablanca , morocco ,
while they were visiting on a cruise .
six hours later , the family received ransom demands --
$ 400,000 u.s.
or the kidnappers say they &apos;ll kill the hostages .
method of contact ?
proof of life was photographic ,
sent via anonymous e @-@ mail .
ransom demand came by way of phone call
to the victims &apos; families .
now , the call was routed through a darknet v.o.i.p. relay .
by darknet , you mean --
tor routed . untraceable .
that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
they demanded the ransom be paid in bitcoin .
this ain &apos;t these guys &apos; first dance .
doesn &apos;t look like it .
seems like we &apos;re dealing with experienced kidnappers .
the family was instructed not to contact authorities .
naturally , their first call was to us .
the man on the phone said he &apos;d call back in eight hours .
monty &apos;s gonna intercept the call and re @-@ route it to the jet .
what do we have on similar incidents in the area ?
there have been somewhere between 90 and 100 abductions
in morocco in the last decade ,
most in the southern desert regions .
most are local clans involved in petty land skirmishes .
it &apos;s very rare to involve tourists ,
and never americans until now .
reports in the area are still filed by hand ,
so interpol said it would take a while to scan and send .
let us know what you find .
this says that the carsons were taken from a crowded market
without attracting any attention .
well , grabbing two people would require a team , multiple unsubs .
yes , but in my experience ,
any more than three or four
would be too many to effectively coordinate .
yeah , but there &apos;s got to be a leader ,
somebody calling the shots .
and a point man -- someone who could lure the carsons
without raising suspicions .
has to be around a lot of people .
and left a trace .
that &apos;s where we start --
the spotter .
peter . who are those men ?
i don &apos;t know .
this -- this blindfold --
oh , god .
what ? what is it ?
it &apos;s him .
hello .
hello ?
the family was told not to contact anyone .
they didn &apos;t . the cruise line did .
to whom am i speaking ?
he &apos;s educated .
this is jack garrett of the fbi .
so ... do you have my money ?
i &apos;m working on it .
so what do i call you ? what &apos;s your name ?
you can call me ben .
ben . what &apos;s the significance ?
well , listen to me , ben .
we both want the same thing here --
for you to get paid and for the carsons
to be returned safely to their family .
are you a father , ben ?
not a father .
he &apos;s unwilling to give up any unnecessary information .
i need to speak with the carsons .
i need to know they &apos;re okay .
where is my money ?
it &apos;s coming .
you &apos;ve done this before . you know it &apos;s gonna take time .
but for right now , i need to speak with peter and kate .
no .
you get me my money , jack garrett of the fbi .
you have 72 hours or the carsons die .
第一季 第七集
&quot; you are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth . &quot;
kahlil gibran .
68 hours .
the clock &apos;s ticking .
we ready ?
simmons , head to the abduction site .
see what the kidnappers left behind .
salah sabila of the casablanca p.d. will meet you there .
on it .
mae , you and clara head to the ship .
start a victimology from the carsons &apos; state room
and the other people on that tour .
where you headed , jack ?
you &apos;re not the only one
who has to deal with children .
no , sir . according to international law ,
this ship is subject only to the laws
of the country under whose flag she flies .
not while you &apos;re in port .
here , i am the rule of law .
if you think i &apos;m letting you
or any of your thugs onboard this -- - thugs ?
you heard me . the crime happened in your square .
why won &apos;t you let my men come into town and investigate ?
because you are visitors .
and you &apos;re incompetent .
gentlemen .
unit chief jack garrett of the fbi .
the first thing for both of you to remember
is that we &apos;re here to get peter and kate carson back alive .
my team has been in touch with the kidnappers .
their p.o.c. is a man who calls himself ben .
we want to focus our efforts on locating him .
what do you have ?
nothing .
great .
chief inspector rains ,
considering the victims are americans ,
would you mind if the fbi ran point on this ?
no . that would be fine .
good . mr. veidt ,
while you may be head of security
while the ship &apos;s at sea ,
on land , we &apos;re all subject to the laws and conventions of the kingdom of morocco .
please order your men to stay on the ship .
yes , sir .
we &apos;d like to interview some of the crew .
great . let &apos;s go to work .
agent montgomery , my dad taught sixth grade for 40 years .
i mean , my mom was a social worker .
they built habitat houses in the summer .
there &apos;s no way we can come up with $ 400,000 .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
i just have to let you know that the rules have changed .
the fbi would be allowed to help facilitate any ransom exchange
if you had the money - and if that were your choice .
my parents had to scrimp and save to go on this trip .
it was supposed to be my dad &apos;s retirement celebration .
i just -- i don &apos;t understand .
why would anyone want to kidnap them ?
we &apos;re still trying to figure that out .
so this is how it works ?
you save your entire life and then you get kidnapped ?
stay strong , grace .
agent garrett and his team will do everything in their power
to bring your parents home safe .
did you hear that ?
i think they said fbi .
shh ! i &apos;m trying to listen .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s just a child .
water .
please .
he speaks english .
what &apos;s your name ?
please .
we don &apos;t have much , but we &apos;ll give you whatever we can .
just let us go .
please .
come back !
right over there .
i am sabila .
ssa matt simmons , fbi .
oh , yes . we &apos;ve been expecting you .
suspect ?
he is a nobody .
we &apos;re just trying to put a little scare into the locals .
this market is a -- how do you say --
a wretched hive of scum and villainy ?
so , do we have a crime scene ?
not really .
the souk sets up every morning , tears down every night .
the carts change places every day ,
so there &apos;s not much left in terms of physical evidence .
well , i can see at least a dozen potential points of egress .
14 , by my count .
so the kidnappers could have come and gone from anywhere .
it &apos;s a lot busier than i remember .
the market has undergone a revival in recent years .
nowadays , people travel from thousands of miles
to sell their wares in the casablanca bazaar .
so , between the vendors and the customers ,
any given day you &apos;re getting , what ,
a couple thousand people coming through here ?
anybody see anything ?
you didn &apos;t ask .
cause you &apos;re too busy harassing the locals .
we were getting around to it .
mm @-@ hmm . let me help you with that .
yeah , we &apos;ll start with the merchants .
thank you .
okay .
interior stateroom .
save on the tickets .
budget luggage .
tips for cheap travel .
some leftovers from the ship &apos;s buffet .
so if organized , methodical kidnappers target their victims ,
why would they choose a couple
who so clearly don &apos;t have any money ?
oh ho ho . what &apos;s with the bling , mr. carson ?
can &apos;t afford a room with a view ,
but you can afford a $ 6,000 watch .
it was a gift .
when dad announced his retirement ,
the whole community got together
and created a scholarship fund in his name .
and they gave him the watch as a thank @-@ you
for 40 years of service .
people must have really liked your dad .
you know how everyone has that one teacher
that really believed in them , changed their lives ?
mr. eastman . a.p. calculus .
my father was that to so many people .
he was so proud of that watch .
he wore it everywhere .
you don &apos;t really think that &apos;s what got them kidnapped ?
we don &apos;t know .
but at this point , it does fill in some blanks .
why would i know them ?
cause several people are saying
they saw you bartering with them yesterday .
i see hundreds of people here a day .
i &apos;m supposed to remember them all ?
there were suggestions
that you may have shown them into the back room .
you have something to hide , hassan ?
no . nothing .
my friend , you like ? i can make you a deal .
i can -- i can make you an offer .
see , hassan , this type of behavior --
this suggests to us something we call
&quot; avoidance and transference . &quot;
it &apos;s what makes me think you &apos;re lying .
of course he &apos;s lying . look at him .
if you hadn &apos;t seen the carsons ,
why didn &apos;t you just tell us ?
i did ! i did !
no , you didn &apos;t . no , you didn &apos;t .
when i asked if you &apos;d seen them ,
you asked me why would you have .
then when i ask you a follow @-@ up ,
you make it about pretty much anything
except for the question i asked you .
you want me to beat him a little ?
no , no .
thanks .
hassan .
are you gonna tell me what happened
between you and the carsons ?
that &apos;s perfectly all right .
you can &apos;t remember what you didn &apos;t see .
thanks for your time .
no problem .
next .
please . i @-@ it wasn &apos;t my idea .
it was the merchant &apos;s .
you know , we could have saved time
if we had done this from the start .
where are the carsons , hassan ?
i showed them some clothing .
they went on their way . i swear it !
everybody saw them come in . nobody saw them go out .
where are they ?
no , they went out through the back .
you see ? they left .
the last i saw , they were talking to another man .
describe him .
the vendor said he was a clean @-@ cut man
in his 20s or 30s , wearing western clothing .
body language and linguistics
make me think he was telling the truth ,
but he was holding something back .
i don &apos;t know what .
i do .
he and some of the other shop owners
were running a kickback scheme
with one of the tour guides from the boat .
the guide would steer inexperienced travelers
towards specific shopkeepers in the souk
who would overcharge for cheap souvenirs .
then they &apos;d send a portion of the profits
back to the tour guide as a finder &apos;s fee .
it &apos;s too basic a scam to be our unsubs ,
but they may have been watching , using it to identify targets .
it &apos;s a good start .
guys , i got something , and you &apos;re not gonna like it .
interpol found three other kidnappings
over the last five years with the same m.o. as the carsons &apos; .
couples grabbed off cruise ships .
same anonymous e @-@ mail server , same bitcoin address .
none of the victims were american ,
or else we would have heard of them .
these aren &apos;t even in morocco .
these cases are in algeria ,
tunisia , and libya .
and it gets worse .
in each of these cases , whether the ransom was paid or not ,
all the victims were killed by a single gunshot to the head .
these aren &apos;t simple kidnappers .
they &apos;re serial killers .
and we &apos;ve got 51 hours to find them .
jack , things have changed .
i want my money in 24 hours
or i start sending body parts .
16 hours .
why shorten the timeline now
and not in any of the previous cases ?
look .
every time that they take someone ,
the ransom goes up --
$ 50,000 , $ 75,000,
$ 200,000 , and now $ 400,000 .
so , they &apos;re either getting bolder
or they &apos;re getting more desperate .
moving the deadline makes me think it &apos;s the latter .
they &apos;re not just greedy . they need money .
for what ?
drugs ? guns ? debts ?
so , what do we know about them ?
they &apos;re not emotional .
gunshot wound to the head is -- is dispassionate .
if it was a single actor , i &apos;d say they were unbalanced ,
but groups tend to keep one another in check .
for five years ?
it &apos;s a long time for people like this to stay together .
so they &apos;re tight @-@ knit , loyal .
could they be family ?
i mean ben means &quot; son &quot; in arabic .
family or not , they &apos;re mobile .
it &apos;s 1,200 miles from the first abduction site to here .
why go all that way for a snatch @-@ and @-@ grab ?
you know , at the market , salah ,
he said that people travel thousands of miles
to sell their goods at the casablanca bazaar .
now , i thought he was exaggerating , but --
but north africa is home to some of the world &apos;s
most wide @-@ ranging nomadic merchant populations .
you mean like gypsies .
that &apos;d be a great way for the unsubs to hide .
monty , find resources that track
the migratory patterns of north african merchants .
we &apos;re looking for a group that may have been in the area
during each of the three prior kidnappings .
you understand .
what are they saying ?
his hands are rough like worker .
i @-@ i build houses in the summer .
rich people build houses in your country ?
i told you . we &apos;re not rich .
i really appreciate it . mm @-@ hmm .
i can do that .
i understand .
thank you .
good news ?
yes .
the bank agreed to give me an emergency loan against my house .
i can pay the ransom .
you have news . what is it ?
it &apos;s not about your parents ,
but we have identified three other kidnappings
by the same group .
in those cases , when the ransom was paid ...
the victims turned up dead .
now , grace , we cannot presume anything .
we have every reason to believe your parents are alive ,
but i need you to not pay the ransom
to give my team as much time as possible .
what ?
wait , first , you &apos;re telling me to get you the money ,
and now you &apos;re saying we can &apos;t use it ?
that &apos;s not what i said . i did not say to get the money .
you strongly implied it !
you said you would facilitate the payment .
those were your words .
you told me that we would pay the ransom and get them back .
that &apos;s what you said .
i understand that you &apos;re frustrated .
but circumstances have changed .
if you give them the money ,
you &apos;ll make it very difficult for my team .
no . i &apos;m not gonna just sit here
while some psychopath murders my parents .
i want to pay the ransom , and i want them back .
look , i know you feel helpless .
i know that you &apos;re a person of action ,
and right now , it feels like the only option
you have is to give them the money ,
but i &apos;m telling you from experience ,
that is the wrong thing to do .
my team is the best in the world at this .
please .
let them do their job .
so , tripit doesn &apos;t exactly have a wandering nomad registry ,
but i think i found a link between the carsons &apos; abductions
and the three previous kidnappings .
during the three prior kidnappings ,
the same tribe of tuareg merchants was in the area .
the tuaregs --
as in the &quot; wandering blue men of the sahara &quot; ?
the very same .
now , according to the state department ,
who apparently tracks this kind of thing ,
the tribe is attending
an annual gathering of tuareg tribes
that happens to be in casablanca right now .
the tuaregs are nomadic merchants
who still roam the desert by camel
and set up camp wherever they go .
they &apos;re famous for their silversmithing
and their beautiful indigo clothing .
the blue dye they use -- it rubs off on their skin ,
and over the years , they &apos;ve come to be known by it .
you think you &apos;re gonna get victor laszlo ,
and you end up getting &quot; lawrence of arabia . &quot;
yeah , the tuaregs --
they still live like they did 1,000 years ago .
my god , look at this place .
400 grand would last a lifetime in a world like this .
still , they have to be spending it on something .
let &apos;s find out what .
so , you want that we should ransack it ?
let &apos;s try some diplomacy first .
see how far talking gets us .
it &apos;s up to you .
you think they &apos;re keeping the carsons here ?
i doubt it . this camp is wide open .
it &apos;d be tough to get hostages in and out of here
without the entire tribe being in on it .
these are filthy people .
i would be surprised if they weren &apos;t .
this guy .
so ... we &apos;re looking for a small group
that &apos;s educated and technological .
yeah , you see a lot of places
with a high @-@ speed internet connection around here ?
even if the kidnappers aren &apos;t here ,
we know this is their group ,
so somebody here knows who they are .
just keep your men back .
let &apos;s go make friends .
alpha males everywhere we go .
yeah , it &apos;s the way of the world .
yeah , well , at least this time they &apos;re working to our benefit .
yeah , if jack can keep the boys busy .
you &apos;ve come a long way , friend .
we appreciate your hospitality .
it &apos;s always my pleasure
to welcome new visitors to our camp .
i &apos;m afraid i come with troubling news .
we believe some members of your flock may have strayed .
we think a group of men may have kidnapped some americans .
please .
tell me of these men you seek so i can see if i can help .
we believe there are maybe three or four ,
possibly a family , who are in dire need of money .
that could describe any family in this camp .
certainly you don &apos;t mean to accuse my entire tribe .
of course not . that wasn &apos;t my intention .
these men ... have become deadly .
my men are deadly .
we think they &apos;re abducting men and women to kill them
and steal their family &apos;s wealth .
that , my men would not do .
matrilineal ?
yeah .
in the tuareg culture ,
power is passed down the maternal lines .
women are the property owners ,
and the leadership is not passed from chieftain to son ,
but to the eldest male child of his sister .
so daddy &apos;s in charge ,
but mommy still pulls the strings .
are we gonna scrap ?
my neighborhood , you take off your earrings
and you &apos;re ready to throw down .
you are from greenwich , connecticut .
yeah , well .
welcome .
i was wondering if we could talk .
as you can see , we have everything we could need .
the tuareg life is simple .
we desire not for the indulgence of this world .
what about computers or education ?
we have no need .
our young are taught what they need to know .
the children learn to read and write .
what if somebody wanted a more formal schooling ?
we are an open people .
some have been known to leave the camp
and pursue an education .
how do they pay for that ?
we are not without some resources .
families share .
mr. jack .
your people tell us that we are poor ,
and they tell us that money can bring hope .
is it any surprise to you
that men would do terrible things in the name of hope ?
so you do know who these men are .
let us assume for a moment
that someone from my camp committed the crimes
of which you speak .
i can assure you they will be found
and they will be dealt with .
the carsons don &apos;t have time to wait for tribal justice .
i mean no offense ,
but would you mind if we look around your camp ?
of course i would mind .
you want justice . i find it admirable .
but you must understand that we , as travelers ,
have been accused of many crimes we did not commit .
jack , we are both leaders of men .
if i allow my camp to be searched at every accusation ,
how long do you think that would remain true ?
not long , i &apos;m sure .
our tinesmegelen have provided us with medicine for centuries .
tinesmegelen ?
faith healers .
well , this is more than faith .
can you tell us about this ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have said what i can .
as predicted , the chieftain was cordial but uncooperative .
but he wanted us to know the men we &apos;re looking for
are part of this tribe .
he said men can do terrible things in the name of hope .
modern medicine hope ?
there was an empty cot in the medical tent .
missing patient ?
he &apos;s just a boy !
do you feel powerful when you hit a child ?
you &apos;re no man , you coward !
peter ! no .
stop it ! you &apos;re hurting him !
please ! please ! don &apos;t !
take him to the desert and kill him .
show them we mean business .
no !
10 hours .
if we don &apos;t find the carsons by the end of the day ,
we &apos;ll be lucky to find them at all .
okay , the piece we found at the camp
was a tg @-@ 135 precision i.v. control valve .
that &apos;s used to administer medication to patients
who have chronic conditions like cancer or kidney failure .
long @-@ term diseases that require expensive medical care .
if one of the kidnappers or a family member was sick ,
that would explain why they need the money .
and if the disease is degenerative ,
it would speak to the increasing urgency of the ransom demands .
you saw that camp . it was primitive .
why would people who reject all forms
of modern life turn to this ?
the matron said that some of the children
leave the tribe to go to school .
what if one of them came back ,
thought they could save the life of a family member ?
that would explain where the unsubs learned to use technology .
monty , see if you can find hospital records
for any members of that tribe
who are receiving ongoing treatment
for some type of degenerative condition .
you got a surname ?
the sahara is the largest desert on earth .
well , let &apos;s concentrate on the ports
where the previous kidnappings occurred .
and do it fast . we only have till the end of the day .
or not .
peter carson &apos;s just turned up at a hospital in town .
he &apos;s in bad shape .
is he alive ?
i want to talk to him .
he &apos;s in surgery now .
his injuries were pretty extensive ,
but the doctor says he &apos;s gonna be okay .
where &apos;s my mother ?
we don &apos;t know .
the kidnappers may still have her .
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re paying .
grace .
no .
your people had their chance .
i &apos;m not gonna just sit here
and wait for my mom to turn up dead .
thank you .
hey , jack . we got a problem .
family &apos;s gonna pay the ransom ,
so if kate didn &apos;t escape with peter --
peter didn &apos;t escape .
he arrived here with a femur broken in three places .
the only way that peter got to this hospital
was if someone else brought him .
one of the kidnappers ?
who beats a man to death &apos;s door
and then takes him in to get medical care ?
this doesn &apos;t fit the profile .
none of the other victims were beaten .
there was no indication of violence before they were killed .
the beatings , the urgency --
the unsubs are devolving .
they &apos;re becoming emotional .
the man on the phone was cold and rational .
whoever did this has rage issues .
yet someone showed compassion enough to take peter in .
they &apos;re no longer working in concert .
there &apos;s gonna be a power struggle for control of the group .
any time we thought we had is gone .
wait a minute .
peter &apos;s watch .
it &apos;s not here .
casablanca p.d. already searched the town for it .
that was before when the unsubs were in control .
a few thousand dollars wasn &apos;t gonna get them what they needed ,
but now they &apos;re desperate , losing rationality .
you think they would sell it ?
simmons , go to the map .
the bodies in the previous cases were all found
within three kilometers of the abduction sites .
three @-@ click radius from the bazaar .
not much of a comfort zone , but the hospital fits inside .
now , between the hospital and the bazaar ,
where can you unload a $ 6,000 watch ?
you mean like a jewelry district ?
well ... jewelry store owner said a kid came by
and hawked it this afternoon .
said he came from the docks in a truck filled with blue cloth .
of course . the tuaregs .
they &apos;re -- they &apos;re traveling merchants .
that &apos;s the one thing we didn &apos;t see at the camp .
we were looking for the kidnappers ,
not where they keep their merchandise .
that &apos;s it .
hey , monty .
we need a record search
for warehouse leases near the port .
looking for a short @-@ term rental the tuaregs may be using
to store their wares for the festival .
please , don &apos;t hurt me .
uh , northwest corner of the block .
tuaregs rented a warehouse for the duration of the festival .
copy .
there &apos;s still a hostage inside .
no one moves without my signal .
got eyes on .
tell your men to back off .
let her go , ben .
we &apos;ll kill her . i swear it .
i know you will .
i know about the others .
you &apos;re too smart for this , ben . think about it .
you shoot the hostage , we &apos;re coming in .
we got three kidnappers . the big one &apos;s got a gun on kate .
jack , don &apos;t go in there .
damn it .
you shoot me , they &apos;ll come through that door and kill you .
we all want the same thing --
for everyone to come out of this alive .
you don &apos;t want to see your brothers get hurt , now , do you ?
let her go .
this is about your mother , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s what the money &apos;s for -- so you can take care of her .
what do you care ? no one cared when she got sick !
let the woman go , and i &apos;ll see to it
that your mother is cared for .
american hospitals -- the best .
it &apos;s too late .
the cancer -- there &apos;s nothing we can do .
there is still time !
you heard the doctor .
one more surgery .
one more time and she will be fine !
no , brother ! medicine is not magic !

or shame for their actions .
