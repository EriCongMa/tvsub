Happy Thanksgiving!
Aunt Deb?
So I went to the doctor
and they ran a whole bunch of tests, and, um...
I have a tumor in my brain.
Aunt Deb, she's sick.
It's inoperable,
but she's refusing any other kind of treatment.
I guess that's her choice, right?
Well, yeah, it's her choice, but here's the thing.
I mean, it's not just her who's gonna be affected by this.
Aunt Deb practically raised my sister mary.
We're gonna get through this.
You know that?
Listen, I'm so glad
you decided to fight back, Deb.
You can thank Leonard for that.
Leonard popped the question
and I said yes!
Who here presents this lovely bride
to be married to this man?
I do.
You may kiss the bride.
I remember everything about that day.
I was wearing this wedding dress.
The trade winds had settled,
and there wasn't a cloud in sight.
The ocean was as blue as the sky.
It was magnificent.
But compared to you...
you were standing there in your tuxedo,
so... so handsome, so dapper.
You called me your angel.
Your one in a million.
I had never been so happy.
I miss you, darling.
Take care of my Leonard.
Yes, ma'am.
When we were boys, we had to learn that sacred chant
by heart and understand its meaning.
By the end of this weekend,
I expect all you boys to know it, too.
All right, bring it in.
All right, bring it in.
All right.
Pass that around.
I want all of your electronic devices,
anything that connects you to the outside world--
Your cell phones,
tablets, your fitness bands.
Oh, man.
I wasn't kidding
when I told you that for the next couple of days,
we are going back to the old ways.
That includes the Dick Tracy watch, Liani.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay.
Each of you is being given a pahi.
Now, the blade is sharp, okay, so be careful.
And while we're setting up camp,
each of you boys is going to head into the jungle
and find a koa tree.
Now, using your pahi,
you're gonna cut off a fresh branch
and carve your own ihe.
When you're done,
it should look something like this.
Now, to pass the first test of your ho'ike,
you're gonna have to dodge a barrage of these
that I'm gonna throw at you.
Relax. Tips will be covered. You'll be fine.
All right, any questions?
When do we get our phones back?
Any other questions?
Good. All right, you have two hours
to gather your wood.
How are we supposed to know what time it is?
You took all our stuff.
The same way your ancestors did. Use the sun.
And if you can't, just start counting.
Now go.
It's gonna be a long weekend.
Still got it.
What the hell?
Did you hear that?
Please! Somebody help!
Please! Help me!
Somebody help! I need help!
Please! Help me. I need help.
My boy. He's been shot.
He's all I've got.
Please, don't let him die.
Please don't-don't let him die!
Please don't let him die.
He's all I...
He's my only son.
He's all I have.
Please don't let him die. Please don't...
Please don't let him die.
Well, that happened.
Oh, we had way too much fun.
And way too many Mai Tais.
How did we end up here?
Well, I believe it started
when you insisted on walking me to my room.
This is it?
This is it.
Where do you think you're going?
A gentleman always walks a lady to the door.
Well...
You know, I think all that rum may have clouded your memory.
All right.
All right, have a good night.
Hey. A gentleman walks a lady to the door.
Okay.
Okay. Good night.
That is so not what happened.
Well, you know, this hotel has security cameras
in all the hallways.
I could just go pull the footage.
Okay.
Why don't you go do that.
And I'm gonna take a shower.
Unless you want to join me.
I could look at that footage anytime.
‭No.
Lieutenant Kelly.
Yeah. No, no. I know where it is.
Uh, yeah, I'll pick her up on the way.
Liani's father was back at camp.
He heard the gunshots, and he ran into the jungle
and found his son lying here
with two gunshot wounds to the chest.
No sign of a shooter.
All right, well, the kid is still in surgery.
According to the nurse, in addition to the injuries
that he got from the bullets,
he also sustained several fractures
consistent with a very serious fall.
Hey, that's a koa tree.
It's the wood that Liani would've needed
to carve his spear.
Okay.
So he got shot up there,
and either he fell over the side or he got thrown off.
Look. Looks like he cut a path through here on his way up.
Okay. Kono and I will go up and take a look.
Okay. We'll go talk to the other kids,
see if they saw anything.
Okay.
Hey, you think they're, uh...
Knocking 'em? Oh, yeah.
Footprints.
I got gravitational blood drops.
This is definitely our crime scene.
Okay.
I got a second set of footprints.
Tire tracks.
Kono.
These drag marks are fresh.
This door has been opened recently.
What the hell is this place?
During World War II, the U.S. military
had munitions bunkers all over the island.
Yeah?
Well, I don't think this was one of 'em.
That flag represents the Empire of Japan.
After Peal Harbor, some Japanese Americans
sympathetic to the Emperor
went underground to avoid internment.
This could've been a hiding place.
Okay. I'll buy that.
That still doesn't explain
what our shooter was doing in here.
Look-- more footprints.
Well, he's not gonna have any answers for us.
Well, judging by the size and density of the radius,
I'd say these are the remains of a mature adult male.
Furthermore, I'd estimate
they're as old as this rather spacious crypt.
Okay, well, without the rest of him,
I imagine it's gonna be pretty tough to determine C.O.D.
Well, perhaps not.
CSU found this
in the soil among the bones.
Oh, a slug.
Hey, what if the person who shot Liani
was in here covering up an old murder?
Yeah, but why now, 75 years after the fact?
Hey, guys.
I got something you need to see.
Based on the width of the axle
and the size of the tires,
I'd say our shooter was driving some sort of cargo van.
Once I get these impressions back to the lab,
I'll narrow down and make a model, no problem.
But in the meantime, check this out.
The approaching tread impression is shallow,
the departing is deep.
So the van came up here empty and left full.
Best guesstimate, about 2,000 pounds full.
Well, this wasn't about some old bones, then,
there was something else in that bunker.
All the morning's yours, Aunt Deb. What do you want to do?
What do I want to do?
I want to drive your truck.
What?
Your pickup truck.
I-I want to take that bad boy for a spin.
Oh, my gosh.
Do you even know how to drive, Aunt Aeb?
Honey, I lived in Los Angeles my whole life.
I was driving before you were in camo diapers.
I-I know, but why the sudden urge to drive a truck?
Well, you know, actually, it's for Leonard.
Uh, last year, we got together
and we made up a list of things
that each one of us wanted to do before we died.
Like a bucket list?
Yeah.
What was on it?
Well, we wanted to see the Pyramids,
we wanted to learn how to ski, and...
I wanted to get a tattoo.
Oh, don't get a tattoo.
Trust me, it's not the...
She got a tattoo...
It's too late.
Look.
Yeah, sorry, kiddos, but the two of you
are not the only ones in the family now with ink.
Okay, good. I'm glad you have ink.
So, um, anyway, we never did get to finish the list,
but one of the items on Leonard's list
was he wanted to drive a police car.
That's such a boy thing.
‭So, uh, how many ponies under that hood?
I'd really... I'd really prefer you didn't find out.
Steven, I hate to play this card,
but I just lost my husband,
so you're not really gonna deny me this, are you?
We're flying!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You look a little green.
No, I'm... Can you please watch the road?
Please keep your eyes on the road.
This is torture for you, isn't it?
Are you gonna puke?
Puke, puke!
Uh, no, jo... Joanie, don't.
I'm not gonna puke, joanie.
Puke, puke, puke, puke, puke... He's gonna puke.
I'm not gonna puke!
...Puke, puke...
Tell her to be quiet.
You look like you just saw a ghost.
Rough commute.
How's your aunt?
She's fine.
She's, uh... She's actually not bad, everything considered.
Thanks for asking.
Kono filled me in, but what's the latest?
Well, couple developments.
For starters, ballistics just came in.
Yeah, the two slugs pulled out of the kid
and the one found with the bones
were fired from the same weapon.
A japanese nambu pistol.
Standard issue for the japanese military during world war-Ⅱ.
Discontinued, 1945.
Wait a minute, this thing was in the bunker all these years,
then that kid walks in
and our suspect picks this up and shoots him with it?
Yep. And now he's fighting for his life at King's Medical.
Okay. What else we got?
Check this out.
What was inside?
Cyanide.
Cyanide?
I know, crazy, right?
The secret bunker, the world war-Ⅱ pistol,
the kill pill in the ring with the hidden compartment?
I mean, this is some real-deal secret agent stuff.
Take it easy.
Obviously, we think the remains in the bunker
could've been those of a japanese spy.
Yeah, Max managed to scrape together a DNA sample.
We're hoping Japan will help us I.D. It.
Yeah, once we figure out who the rotting corpse belongs to,
it'll help us figure out who was up there this morning and why.
And what about the rest of the evidence?
Actually, I was just getting to that when you walked in.
Now, I can tell you what all this stuff is,
but I got no idea what any of this means.
This is washi.
A light but durable paper made from the mulberry bush.
Definitely of japanese origin.
Over here we got canvas bags, some bungee cables.
Now, the only thing I can tell you about these items is,
like the paper, it's old,
like, circa 1904s-old.
Also made in japan.
I just got a "Jerry alert."
Yeah, me too.
Same.
Yeah, hope you don't mind,
I took some initiative. fed your boy Ortega some of this intel.
Figured it was in his wheelhouse.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
God, I love the ocean.
It just calms me.
Well, actually, it's overcast today.
Not in here. It's always perfect.
All right, I know it's not real,
but I had to do something.
My mother's basement had more natural light than this place.
Plants won't even grow down here.
I was starting to lose it.
Jerry, your text said it was urgent.
You're not exactly radiating urgency.
Okay, gather round and prepare to have your minds blown.
And I'm not just talking figuratively. Pun intended here.
Okay, jer.
Right. So...
In 1944, the Japanese military
initiated a program called Operation Fugo.
They used the winter trade winds to launch
thousands of balloon bombs from japan,
across the pacific, timed to detonate
when they reached the U.S. Mainland.
As it happens, these balloons were made of paper.
Anybody want to guess which kind?
Uh, washi?
Gold star for you, inspector.
Canvas bags filled with sand and bungee cords
were used as part of the ballast to help control the trajectory.
Each of these balloons was equipped
with an incendiary explosive device and a 15-kilogram bomb.
These bombs were designed to fall on populated areas,
kill civilians and ignite forest fires.
The concept was genius.
But the operation was an epic fail.
Well, maybe 'cause it sounds like a plan concocted by Wile E Coyote.
Look, if this fugo operation was launched in japan,
why did we find all the materials in a bunker on Oahu?
Here's why:
my far east sources-- the same ones that helped us
with the Chinese satellite situation a couple years back--
tell me that there's classified intel that in the summer of 1940
the japanese government
was secretly developing Fugo here on Oahu,
with a planned launch coinciding with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
All the necessary supplies were smuggled in,
but something happened and it never became operational.
So what you're saying is you think
that bunker may have been full of bombs.
Yeah.
That sounds like something someone might shoot a kid over.
According to Eric,
that van weighed almost a ton when it left the area.
That's a lot of explosives.
Yeah, it is. And after all this time,
they're gonna be highly unstable.
Which means that detonation-- whether intentional
or otherwise-- in a populated area...
We're gonna be looking at a mass body count.
Is there anything in this place that is not fried?
The napkins.
So... Tell me, Nicky, how's the singing racket?
Not bad, but it would be a lot better if I had a partner.
My nephew warned me about this.
Don't think about it. Just say yes.
No, I'm afraid not, Nicky.
That ship has sailed.
Oh, the hell it has.
Do you remember Thanksgiving a couple years ago,
you got up on stage, you belted out an Irving Berlin number?
You were dynamite.
The club loved you.
That was a nice night, wasn't it?
And there'll be many other nights just like it.
No, I don't think so.
Listen to me, I get your apprehension,
but just hear me out.
Nicky.
Renovations on the club,
they'll be done in a couple of months.
Look, honey...
The next time you come out...
Honey... ...
We'll bang out a couple of duets...
Nicky...
And you'll love it.
Please.
I'm telling you, you'll just go cra...
Please.
There's not gonna be a next time.
How long?
Not long.
Nicky, it's okay. I've made peace with it.
Did you tell Steve and Mary?
No.
And I-I'm not going to, uh...
When I told them the first time, they were devastated.
Especially Mary.
I... I'm not gonna put 'em through that again.
Is there... anything that I can do?
Yeah, there is one thing.
Name it.
Okay. After I'm gone,
Steve is gonna need someone in his life with a little wisdom.
I'll be there.
Actually, I was going to ask if you knew someone.
Very funny.
Yeah, I know you're gonna be there for him.
Thank you.
You know, your friendship has meant everything to me, Nicky.
Excuse me.
Can I get you anything else?
Oh, yes, anything you haven't had.
What?!
Come on! What do you want to do,
take me with you?
My arteries are getting hard as we speak.
Oh, we haven't had the jalapeno poppers
or the fried zucchini.
That would be g... Oh, and also,
would you bring my friend here
some cholesterol medication?
Very well.
Cheers.
All right, thanks. That was Eric.
The tire treads at the crime scene
belong to a Nissan nv1500.
Hpd's flagged all the plates,
and Duke's got units going door-to-door.
Should be just a matter of time
before we talk to every registered owner.
Time is something we don't have.
All right, who we looking at here?
So, we got a hit on the DNA profile that Max sent out.
Remains in the bunker belong to 2nd lieutenant Aki Hiroda--
which is interesting,
considering that the Japanese army lists him as killed
in action in the battle of Changsha, China,
in the spring of 1940.
So what, they faked his death?
Or they gave him a new life.
The KIA story is classic espionage stuff.
They kill Hiroda on paper, then they send him out here
to work as an agent with a new identity.
All right, well, there's no way that
fugo was a one-man operation.
They had to have other players involved.
That's a safe bet. Also safe to assume
that our perp has a close connection with one of them,
maybe even Hiroda himself.
Otherwise, how would he know about this secret bunker
and what was inside of it?
Yeah, it would also explain
why they tried to take all the bones--
they didn't want us getting an I.D.
Yeah, and we did get an I.D.--
It's still gonna be hard to link someone to that bunker.
Steve's right. We've also got to find the alias
that Hiroda was working under.
I'll get that.
How?
It's not like the Japanese consulate's gonna voluntarily
turn over information regarding an attack on this country.
I'm not gonna ask them.
Looks like Liani's gonna be okay.
He was just moved to recovery.
Oh, that's excellent.
Yeah. Doctors said that
he may be able to be questioned in a few hours.
Good.
How are you holding up?
Um... Hanging in there. Thanks.
What about Adam?
He's keeping his head down, doing his time.
You know, so far the other inmates
seem to be giving him plenty of space.
I was worried that he'd be a target in there 'cause of me,
but it looks like being the son of Hiro Noshimuri
matters a lot more than being married to a cop.
Hey, listen, you make sure Adam knows
that if he needs anything at all...
All right?
Thanks.
That's my guy.
All right, here we go.
Hiroda's spy name was Saburo Mori.
He came here on a temporary visa
to work the sugar plantations in the summer of 1940.
Except he wasn't here to harvest sugarcane;
he was here to stage a terrorist attack.
Right. After Pearl Harbor,
Japanese intelligence assumed he'd been arrested
or rounded up and sent to an internment camp,
but there was no record of that.
Then, after the fall of 1941,
there was no record of him at all.
Until this morning.
Right.
My contact said that these are all the classified documents
related to Operation Fugo,
including names of other agents who were part of the program
when it was here on oahu being developed.
That's microfilm.
Yeah.
I haven't even seen that stuff since I was in grade school.
Wait, can the table read that?
No, the table can't read it. We need a projector.
And where do you suppose we'll get that from?
I'll have the projector back before you close. I swear it.
Like you brought back The Doubt Factory and...
Alien Agenda: Investigating Extraterrestrials Among Us?
Okay, those books were stolen from my basement
by a british terrorist.
Along with your tinfoil hat, I'm sure.
Look, I get it if you don't want to do this for me,
but how about being a good citizen and doing it for Five-0?
For $63.49 in late fees,
I'll be a good citizen.
As we discussed, I'm a little short on cash at the moment.
And I'm short...
On microfilm projectors.
Are you serious? It's a dead technology.
Who's using it?
Not you.
All right, lady, I didn't want to do this,
but you forced me.
We're on the verge of a catastrophe of biblical proportions.
Dozens of japanese-made bombs
were stolen by some wack job
who already tried to kill a kid this morning.
And without receiving any demands,
we're thinking he may just want to blow up the island
with said weapons of mass destruction.
So if you selfishly want to stand in the way
and take on the responsibility of a million lives, be my guest.
HPD sector car patrolling Manoa
just went in pursuit of a Nissan van.
Could be our guy.
Stand down. Have them stand down.
We don't have aviation up yet.
Let it go. I'm telling you,
those bombs are already unstable.
a pursuit could trigger a detonation,
and in that neighborhood,
there's gonna be mass casualties.
All right, we stand down, we lose him.
He's not gonna get far.
Let's just wait till we got those birds in position.
Copy that.
Duke, terminate the pursuit.
I know, I know, but have all units stand down immediately.
Hey, what happened?
So, as soon as HPD pulled back,
the driver ditched his van and took off on foot.
As far as we know, the explosives are still inside.
Wait a minute, our perp had a clean getaway
and he got out of the van and bailed?
Strange, right?
We get a description on this guy?
Partial. Two witnesses say he's male,
he was wearing a hat and sunglasses,
so he could be anywhere between mid-20s and late-40s.
All right, what about the van?
We know anything about the van?
It was reported stolen last night.
EOD boys are here.
火奴鲁鲁警局
All right, boys, listen up.
Anything you don't like, you get the hell out.
Copy that.
She's all yours, Commander.
My man. Thank you.
夏威夷群岛
Hey, guys...
I think we found the rest of Mr. Hiroda.
And this.
That's a nambu type 14.
All right, I'll get it over to Eric,
see if he can pull some prints off of it.
Turns out the navy had some intel on our spy.
According to them,
Hiroda, aka Saburo Mori,
had a handler here on Oahu.
His name was Jiro Takaki.
He worked at the consul general's office as a diplomat,
but after pearl harbor
He was picked up by naval intelligence for questioning.
Items we found in your home
directly link you to Saburo Mori.
We also know Mr. Mori's planning
some kind of attack on the U.S. Mainland.
Now he's up and vanished.
I'm gonna make this simple, Mr. Takaki.
I want to know where Mr. Mori is right now.
I want details on the attack:
time, place and method.
I cannot tell you what I don't know.
You're playing a dangerous game here, my friend.
I'm giving you a chance to cooperate
and spare yourself a turn in the electric chair.
I swear I'm telling the truth.
I don't know where Mr. Mori is,
and I don't know operational details.
I help with logistics and money, that's it.
All I can tell you is Mr. Mori and I were supposed to meet
at Natsunoya Teahouse last week.
That's when he was going to tell me his plan.
But he didn't show.
Who else is involved?
I want names.
There is no one else.
Just Mr. Mori.
Okay, spoiler alert-- Takaki's lying.
According to documents I found on the microfilm,
there was one other person involved in the plot.
And that's this guy.
Yuri Musaka.
He was an officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy
who was sent here around the same time as Hiroda.
Oh, my god, I can hardly keep up.
Okay, so there's Hiroda...
and now Takaki...
and then here's Musaka.
So that makes it at last three guys
who knew about this bunker and knew the contents inside.
Correct.
Okay, so we know
that our shooter's probably connected to one of them,
and we're already looking into Hiroda.
What else can you tell us about the other two?
Unfortunately, not much.
Takaki was sent back to Japan after the war in a pow exchange.
He died of cancer two years later.
There's no surviving family.
How about Musaka?
Still looking.
Problem is, unlike Hiroda, I don't have his alias--
The legend he used when he first got here.
I've been combing through the microfilm,
but so far I've found nothing.
Okay, well, keep digging.
Let us know when you find something.
Roger that.
Okay, so, um, okay, me and Joanie--
We'll go get the car, okay?
You can wait here, all right?
Oh, all right, sweetheart. That sounds good.
All right, I'll be right back.
Oh, Mary?
Take your time, sweetheart.
Uh, I've got something I have to do first.
Can I give you those?
‭Okay. You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Okay.
Are you sure?
Take your time.
All right, I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Hello. Uh, I'd like to talk to someone
about an asset transfer.
Hey, I got your message. You have something for me?
You know it, Lou.
What?
Short for "Lieutenant."
Don't you find that a tad bit confusing,
Considering Captain Grover's first name is Lou?
Yeah, you might be right.
Let's just stick with Lieutenant Kelly.
Copy that.
What have you got?
Found a fresh print on that old pistol you guys recovered.
Pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid.
Ran it through AFIS, came up snake eyes.
But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets
inside the magazine.
Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.
I was able to lift them during a process
called cyanoacrylate fuming,
ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.
Eric... did you get a hit?
Indeed I did.
So the prints that Eric lifted
came back to this guy.
Recognize him?
Yeah, that's Hiroda's coconspirator,
Yuri Musaka.
Except when he got to Oahu in 1941,
he was using the name Youshi Tamuro.
Now, the only reason his prints are in the system to begin with
is because, from 1942 to 1946,
he was a prisoner at Honouliuli Internment Camp.
And it gets better.
Now, Musaka,
still using the name "Tamuro,"
stayed on the island even after the war ended.
In 1947, the guy got married.
In 1949, he started a construction business.
And then, just three days ago,
at the age of 100, he passed away.
So Musaka kills his partner in cold blood.
Then he stays here living under the radar for 75 years.
And now, after all this time, he dies,
and somebody goes right to the secret bunker
and cleans it out.
Anybody else thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, this was never about the bombs.
Whoever shot Liani went in there
to destroy anything that would tie Musaka
to the spy ring or operation fugo.
All right, for all we know,
they had every intention of discarding those bombs.
I think I may know who that person is.
I looked into Musaka's next of kin.
He's survived by two daughters,
both of whom live on the mainland,
and a grandson who lives here on the island.
His name is Kyle Tamuro.
And according to his social media,
he and his grandfather are very close.
Chin, ping his phone.
I got him.
Where is he?
He's in the building.
Kyle tamuro.
On your knees right now. Put your hands behind your head.
Please.
Hands behind your head. Interlock your fingers.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I came here to tell you this was all a mistake.
I was in the bunker cleaning out the place.
No one had been there since the war.
I didn't think anyone else even knew that it existed.
but then I heard a noise.
Someone was coming in.
And there wasn't any other way out.
I was trapped.
Look, all I saw was someone holding a knife,
and I panicked.
Look, I'm so sorry.
I was only trying to protect my grandfather's legacy.
That bunker was hidden for 75 years.
You could have just left it alone.
No, I couldn't.
I mean, that area is about to be developed.
My family's company was asked to submit a bid.
When I mentioned it to my grandfather,
that's when he revealed the truth.
Confessed he had been a spy for the Japanese government.
And a killer. Let's not forget that.
It was kill or be killed.
He said, when it came time to do the mission,
he had a change of heart.
He went to Hiroda, tried to get him to stand down,
but Hiroda wouldn't hear of it.
There was a struggle inside the bunker.
My grandfather had no choice.
He did what he had to do to stay alive.
Look, he was a proud man.
He didn't want anyone to know about his past.
He didn't want to bring shame on our family.
Okay, get up.
How's the boy?
He's all right.
He's got a long road ahead of him.
Please tell his parents I'm very sorry.
Hey, Jer.
Commander.
We, uh... We closed the case.
You know that, right?
Yeah, Chin texted me.
Yet you are still going through the old files.
Yeah, well, it's not every day you get to look
at unredacted government files from the '40s.
Oh. This is like Christmas morning for you.
It's better.
Hey, uh, Jerry,
You know you're not gonna find anything on Roswell in there, Right?
而整个事件被军方掩盖
‭Course not. Don't be ridiculous.
These are navy files.
Air force covered up Roswell.
Right. Uh, okay.
Anyway, I just... I just wanted to come and say good job,
And, uh, you know?
Good job.
Appreciate it.
Hey, did you know the Naval Investigative Service
kept Musaka under surveillance even after the war was over?
No, I didn't know that.
Check it out.
Obviously, they only knew him as Youshi Tamuro,
but they considered him a person of interest.
Kept tabs on him for years.
But the guy was a model citizen, put down roots,
even married a local girl-- Olina Hoku.
They actually met before Pearl Harbor,
but they stayed in touch the entire time
he was in the internment camp.
Wait a minute.
She's the reason he changed his mind.
Look, Musaka came here for one purpose,
and that was to do us harm, right?
Then he falls for this girl.
And in the end, his love for her
outweighed his loyalty to his country.
Love's a pretty powerful thing.
Yes, it is.
That is beautiful, Joanie.
Look at that.
Yes. Do some spirals. Do another one.
Hey, you should flip that.
Okay, well, I know my pancakes,
and I'll flip it when I'm ready.
It's bubbling. It's just,
when it's bubbling, it's ready to be flipped.
Wow. Micromanage much?
Hey. You don't need to get all Danny Williams on me.
I'm just trying to be helpful.
All right, well, if you want to be helpful,
then why don't you go wake up Aunt Deb
and tell her breakfast is ready?
You mean burned, right?
It's not gonna be burned. You're gonna love it.
Okay, hold on.
Joanie, listen to me, okay?
Keep an eye on your mother.
She's got that weird look in her eye.
I don't want her to burn the house down. Oh, my gosh.
Go!
Stop.
Joanie, watch her.
Don't listen to him. Don't listen to him.
Aunt Deb, good morning.
Hey, Mary's burning breakfast downstairs
if you're hungry.
Aunt Deb?
Deb?
Deb?
Deb?
Okay, Deb.
