You ok?
Yeah, I'm just really tired.
He had his meds an hour ago.
Yeah, post-op antibiotics.
Carbenicillin? No, that's not right.
I have a severe reaction to beta lactams.
That's not in your chart.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Garcia! He has a gun!
You saved my life.
Hey, you're ok.
You're ok.
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name,
thy kingdom come, the will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven,
give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
forever and ever.
Amen.
This is not fair.
You should just kill him!
She's right. Why all the fanfare? Let him burn in hell.
Just do it. Kill him!
Kill him! kill him!
Kill him! kill him! kill him!
Kill him! kill him! kill him!
Kill him! kill him! kill him! kill him!
Kill him! kill him! kill him! kill him...
No! no, please! no!
I've been having nightmares all night, every night
about this, and I know you guys
deal with it, and I'm not trying--
it's just that I can't just let it happen.
I--I can't-- I have to go. I have--
Then you should.
You don't think I'm certifiable? You're not mad at me?
No. I'll have Kevin Lynch cover,
and you have a lot of vacation time.
Thank you. Thank you.
You are a terrific boss.
You're a terrific boss.
You're just terrific.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So, what'd he say?
He said I should go to Texas.
Hotch would never say that.
Ok. He said I have a lot of vacation days,
which is kind of the same thing.
He said you were crazy, Garcia, didn't he?
He didn't, because I am not crazy.
Going to see the man who almost killed you and Reid
is way beyond crazy.
He needs to know that I never meant
for him to end up on death row.
Greg Baylor is a murderer.
He's there for a reason.
Then lock him up for life, but killing him
doesn't bring any of the people that he killed back again,
And it's bad karma for everyone.
I've done everything I can think of.
I wrote to the governor on FBI stationery.
I called him 3 times. You said you had a
hook-up with the prosecutor's office.
Baby girl, he pled guilty,
forfeiting a trial. He waived all appeals
and admitted to numerous other killings.
The governor is setting an example.
And Greg Baylor needs to know
that I never meant for this to happen.
So send him a letter.
I already did that. I can't totally explain it,
but I have to go and see him.
Please, I can't talk to Sam about this. You have to have my back.
No. I don't have your back.
He is a murderer. He's scum.
He tried to kill you. Wake up.
Let me know when you're done washing his feet.
So where's Garcia and Morgan?
Are they finally having that love child?
Heard that.
Busted.
Uh, Garcia's taking some personal time.
Is everything ok?
I hope it wasn't those burritos we had yesterday.
She's fine. Kevin Lynch will be presenting the case.
Hiya. Hi.
Sorry.
Where we going?
Seattle, Washington.
Over the past few weeks,
two gentlemen between the ages of 35 and 40
have been killed, with with radically different M.O.S.
First victim, Dan Chen,
was strangled and dropped off on the side of a road.
The second victim, Joe Hazley, was run over by a car.
The intimacy of strangulation suggests a personal attack,
literally and figuratively,
the need to kill in a hands-on manner.
While crushing someone with a car
presents as distance and removal from the kill.
What makes you think they're connected?
The victims' cars were found about two miles from each other,
and they have similar mutilation around their mouths.
And he crosses racial lines.
Well, if you consider that and a similar geo-profile,
maybe we have two different killers.
We could be looking at a team.
A disorganized one.
Or the unsub's just experimenting,
trying to figure out how he or she likes to kill.
Similar to Herzog and Shermantine.
二人共犯谋杀案四起 疑似谋杀案72起
So we need to get to Seattle quickly.
If he's evolving, he could strike again soon.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Where am I?
What is this place?
Pl--
Please.
Please, I'll do--
I'll do whatever you want.
Please!
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope ye who enter here!
"The farther backward you can look,
the farther forward you can see."
Winston Churchill.
All right, victimology. Dan Chen had two children,
Joe Hazley was single.
The first guy was a doctor and the other was a contractor.
Socially they wouldn't overlap.
Well, they may have professionally.
One could have been a patient,
and the doctor could have hired the contractor.
No, I already checked into that. They didn't know each other.
So they were victims of opportunity.
But why change from strangulation
to running over victims in a car?
Well, it seems impulsive,
which implies he's young and inexperienced.
But he had to have the strength to pull this off,
so that probably means he was older.
Um, excuse me, Agent Hotchner.
What is it?
A third victim, Michael Richmond,
was just found about 4 miles
from where they found the last victim.
How was he killed?
He drowned. They found his discarded body on a rural highway,
and he had oral mutilation.
That's near the last victim's abduction site.
Just as we thought, the unsub's moving quickly.
This could be a spree.
All right, when we land, Dave, you and Kate
go to the last abduction site.
Morgan and Reid to the M.E.,
and JJ and I will talk to the families.
Hey, what's going on with Penelope?
Reid, I'll talk to you more about
that when we're alone, all right?
Is she ok? I mean, she isn't sick, is she?
That really depends on your definition of sick.
Goin' to see your boo?
No, not--
No boo.
Girl, I know why you're goin' up there
wearing some flower hose and not trying to get some.
It's complicated.
Trust me.
You want to hear complicated, honey?
My boo is my baby dad's ex.
Ex-girlfriend?
No.
Ex-boyfriend.
Damn. What's he in for?
Armed robbery. But he ain't killed nobody.
He just drove the car.
Oh. Ok.
But, you know, it's a good thing we're going up there today.
'Cause tomorrow they fryin' somebody.
But don't trip.
The day after you can come back and see that boo.
Who I know you're denying is really your boo.
No, he's--
You know, I'm not one to ask the FBI for assistance,
but this was strange.
We're here to help in any way we can.
The first two victims' families should be here shortly.
Have you interviewed the drowning victim's family?
We have officers doing that now.
He was the father of two. Poor kids.
We'll need to talk to his family.
Of course. We'll set you guys up in here.
You have a suspect?
We're putting together a profile.
Shouldn't we hold a press conference?
We don't want to tip our hand.
We also don't want this madman to go crazy.
Unfortunately, we're a little past that.
We'll come up with a media strategy
once we have more information.
We'll see what we get from the family interviews.
All of the victims had different C.O.D.s.
Strangulation,
severe crush injuries,
and finally, drowning.
The last victim's hands and legs were bound
before the unsub forcibly submerged him.
They all have contusions on their heads.
And it looks like he blitz attacks them or hits them
when they try to fight back.
There was no DNA or trace evidence found.
You get the tox screen back?
Nothing out of the ordinary in their systems.
However, I did find some slash marks
on the roofs of their mouths.
Slash marks? We thought it was random mutilation.
What is it?
It's not slashes. It look--
It looks like Roman numerals.
What?
Look.
It's the number 3.
Joe Hazley's body's downstairs.
We'll need to see it.
Reid, what about this guy?
It looks like Roman numeral 5.
So then we may not be looking at victims 1, 2, and 3.
We're probably looking at 3, 4, and 5.
Which means there are two more bodies out there.
I'll have Kevin look into past homicides in the area,
see if any match the M.O.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
9!
They ran him over in a car?
A car? Who would do that? Why Joe?
Does your brother have any enemies?
Not at all.
Ok, um, has he had any run-ins with colleagues or exes?
Joe wasn't like that.
He was a mediator, you know?
The guy at the party who makes sure everyone's having fun.
If you needed $10, he'd give you 20.
Even with his little brother from that program,
he treated him like blood.
So he volunteered as a big brother?
Yes.
He could be tough on Jose.
But that kid went from getting Cs to As thanks to Joe.
How old is Jose?
14.
When he finds out what happened,
it's gonna kill him.
You get anything?
No enemies. Seemed loved.
Yeah, same with Dan Chen.
His wife said he was a good father to the twin 13-year-olds.
The boys said he was tough but fair.
That could be our connection.
Joe Hazley was mentoring a kid the same age
who he was also tough on.
Mike Richmond had a son about the same age, too.
They had an argument about an hour before he went missing.
Maybe our unsub has something against strict paternal figures
with boys in that age group.
Name.
Penelope Garcia.
I'm here to see Greg Baylor.
You're not on the list. Next.
Wait, no. I'm from the FBI.
I left a message.
Oh, yeah. That Garcia.
He said he didn't want to see you.
Next.
No! uh, I came here all the way from Quantico.
He can't just not want to see me.
I have something I have to tell him.
He's on death row.
I understand where he is,
and I also understand the constitution.
And Mr. Baylor still has rights,
which he has decided to exercise.
Next.
Ok, ok.
Uh...can I leave him a note?
You can try.
Can I borrow your pen?
Over there.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Next!
So, this is where Mike Richmond was abducted.
This road is highly trafficked,
but this stretch seems pretty empty.
Our unsub probably followed him.
Yes, so how did he lure them out of their vehicles,
'cause they'd be on alert out here.
He bumps them as they cross the intersection,
then they pull over, thinking they were in an accident.
Like a bump and rob.
But this turned into a bump and abduct.
You know, I had a rapist once
who liked to bump and rape right there on the side of the road.
And no one saw?
No, if they did, they kept going.
I'm convinced most people don't pay attention these days.
If it doesn't happen on the phone, it doesn't exist.
I planned that for effect.
Why don't you answer that?
It's Garcia. I don't know what to tell her, Reid.
She's gone to see Greg Baylor before he gets executed.
Go figure.
It's PTSD.
Her nightmares are PTSD, Reid.
She's taken this to a whole nother level.
You know Garcia.
She carries a laptop, not a gun.
She can't even look at crime scene photos
without needing pictures of panda bears to counterbalance them.
I tried to walk her back from the ledge,
but I think she's already jumped.
I was like that after I shot the LDSK.
Phillip Dowd.
Yeah. At first I felt nothing.
And then-- Gideon was right. It just hit me.
I started to obsess.
Looked up photos of him when he was in the rangers.
I studied cases he worked when he was a cop.
I--even patients he treated while he was a nurse.
Why?
I just wanted to get inside of him.
And I wanted to try to understand why our paths crossed
and see if there was some way that he could have been stopped
before I came along.
What made you finally move on?
All the people he killed.
I put their photos on my wall.
They had lives, too.
If this guy followed our victims
and used a ruse, then he's not just acting on impulse.
No, it's organized victimology.
The father figures are likely surrogates for his own.
There were Roman numerals
carved into the roofs of their mouths,
which is highly symbolic.
Or ritualistic.
With numbers 3, 4, and 5 already found,
it suggests we're missing two earlier victims.
Kevin's looking into it.
Considering the ruse,
the unsub is extremely controlled,
but his M.O. doesn't make any sense.
Then we need to figure out its meaning,
because he's not gonna stop until we do.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Come on, man.
Hey, please. Look, I didn't mean to hit him.
I was just trying to teach him a lesson of right and wrong.
You can understand that, can't you?
Hey. What's wrong with you?
Come on, let me out of here.
What are you doing?
You serious?
Come on, let me out of here.
Please.
Listen.
Hey, come on.
No, no! Come on, no!
Come on, listen!
Listen, listen, listen, come on!
I love my family. Please. Please, please, please!
What are you doing? Come on.
Oh, my God. Oh, Jeez.
Hey, come on, stop!
Oh, God! no!
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Oh, come on! No, no!
Let me out of here!
No! oh!
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Hi, this is Derek Morgan. Please leave a message.
Chocolate mousse?
It's -- it's baby girl.
Clearly we're both into S&M,
because you've been dodging my calls for the last 24 hours,
and I keep calling you although you keep dodging my calls.
Look, I know we parted mad,
and you think I'm nutterbutter for coming here, and...
You're right,
because now I'm here and he doesn't want to see me.
He doesn't want to see me, Derek.
How can I make things better if he doesn't want to see me?
So now I'm here at this motel,
I'm trying not to look at the stains on the bedspread,
and I'm wrestling with the fact that I have egg on my face,
And I'm sorry.
No, you know what? He's sorry.
He's gonna be sorry 'cause he's not hanging out with me.
That's what...
I don't even know what I'm saying.
See, I need to talk to you. Call me back.
Please?
Derek?
You have a collect call
from Baldridge State Correctional Facility.
If you'd like to accept the charges, please press one.
This is Greg Baylor.
Oh, my gosh. It's you.
Hi. How are you?
I mean-- that's a dumb question.
Today at 2:00.
Ok. Ok. Today at 2:00.
This unsub's truly evolving, switching to fire.
This guy's the king of the changing M.O.
He might just be getting more forensically sophisticated.
Fire destroys most trace evidence.
Kevin just found two homicides in the city
from the last 8 weeks which might fit our unsub's M.O.
Were they in the comfort zone?
40 miles out. But they did have
Roman numerals 1 and 2 in their mouths.
The first one was asphyxiated by gas
and the other electrocuted.
That probably makes him number 6,
but why burn him in a box?
You know, it's shaped more like a casket.
What's the symbolism?
Maybe this is how he wanted to see the man
who's at the center of his rage.
Because he's probably in the sixth circle.
Circle of what?
Dan Chen was found in the mud.
The other guy was crushed to death.
I don't think these are random M.O.S.
The unsub is recreating the circles of hell.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
苏格拉底和柏拉图在他身前 其余人站立...
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope.
We believe the unsub we're looking for is a male
between the ages of 35 and 40
who is killing parental figures
based on his need for revenge and punishment.
He's designed his M.O. to recreate Dante's 9 circles of hell.
"The Inferno" is the first part of Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Within it, he describes the sinners he'd encounter
in each circle of hell
and the punishments they'd endured.
The first circle was for those who didn't accept god,
therefore lived in limbo, punished by a blinding fog.
The first victim was found gassed in his apartment.
The second circle was for those guilty of lust,
who'd be blown around in a violent storm.
Oh, no! please...
therefore, our second victim was tied to a fence
and electrocuted.
The third circle was gluttony,
where sinners would be rained on and wallow in mud.
Our next victim was found strangled on the side of the road
covered with dirt.
Our fourth victim was crushed like the punishment
in the next circle reserved for greed.
The fifth circle is wrath,
where sinners were drowned in swampy water,
which is exactly what happened to the next victim.
In the sixth, heretics were trapped in a burning tomb,
like our most recent victim,
and the next 3 circles are just as vicious.
Our unsub killed all the way through the sixth circle
and marked his victims accordingly.
But his victims hadn't committed the sins
associated with each ring,
which suggests that the killings
are symbolic of the father figure who hurt him in the past.
In the poem, Dante traveled with the poet Virgil
who assured him he would enter paradise
if he completed his journey.
Consequently, we believe our unsub
is metaphorically taking this journey with someone else.
I will help you.
I will help you. I will help you.
His Virgil is most likely a sibling
that suffered the same fate
at the hand of an abusive father.
This man's patient. We also think he's an academic.
He stalks his victims,
and after watching them discipline a child,
he waits until what he considers
the appropriate moment to kill them.
We believe he will continue with the final 3 circles
until he feels completely avenged.
4 cavities. Do you know how much that cost me?
I've been brushing my teeth.
Bull!
All you do is eat candy and play video games.
You're grounded for two weeks
and you're not going to the ballgame on Saturday.
Where are we?
The victims' automobiles were found right here.
And that is where all the victims were last seen
prior to the abductions.
So he's able to move around freely.
All right, we need to get back to the poem.
An unsub this committed to a body of work
isn't killing out of the blue.
Maybe he'd obsess over the poem,
maybe even write about it before acting it out.
Create a manifesto?
Yeah. At least be literary enough to post his thoughts.
Kevin, what did you come up with
on people posting online rants about Dante's "Inferno"?
There are over 80 people in the past week.
Subtract high school kids.
We're not looking for screeds about homework.
You got 5 in the state, my friend.
Any in the comfort zone?
One.
What's his name?
Nathan Chow. He's a student at Puget College.
He posted a blog about killing people at his school
using Dante's 9 circles of hell.
When did he do it?
A week before the first murder.
He's a little younger than our profile.
What if he's our Virgil?
We catch him, we catch our unsub.
Send us the address.
Nathan Chow, FBI!
1, 2.
Clear.
Explosives?
That's not circle 7.
No, but suicide is one of the inner circles of 7.
This could be the endgame.
Nathan?
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...
and have him present while you're being questioned.
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
How are you? That's a dumb question.
You look good. I mean, you look good
especially considering--
is this place as bad as it seems?
It could use some paint.
I'm nervous. I can't stop talking. I'm sorry.
Look, I know you got my letter.
And I know you tried to hurt me and my friend,
but I need you to know I never meant for this to happen,
for you to end up on death row.
I tried to stop this.
You tried to stop this?
Yes. I called the governor.
I wrote him a letter.
You had a horrible upbringing. This isn't you.
Why are you really here?
I need you to know I'm in your corner.
Oh. You're not here for me.
You're here for yourself.
That's not entirely true.
Of course it is. You don't know me.
Oh, I know you.
Trust me.
Oh, so you want me to forgive you.
No.
You want me to say I'm a bad man,
I love killing, I deserve this?
No.
Then what the hell is it?
Beause I'm done talking.
I'm done feeling guilty.
I got 10 hours left to breathe,
and the last thing I need is some freaky woman coming up here
with her liberal guilt trying to change things.
I'm a killer.
You can't change that.
I did it.
I killed them.
All 6 of them?
Yes. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Dante had that much of an effect on you, huh?
You figured by taking your victims through hell,
you'd relieve some kind of pain.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
How did you choose the 6 victims?
Were they random, or did they have meaning to you?
Evil isn't random.
It's quite precise.
You made a list and started killing.
No.
They chose their fates.
We're all evil.
Men and women.
Evil doesn't discriminate.
So let's enter through the gates of hell
and talk about the first killing.
You replicated the first circle?
I put her in a fog and I strangled her.
Actually, you chained him in his apartment
and left the oven on.
All the victims were male, Nathan.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Nathan, we know you're working with someone.
Who are you protecting?
Ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Nathan, stop stonewalling us.
You're his Virgil, aren't you?
No. I'm Dante.
I'm Dante.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Ok, why is he taking credit for killings he clearly didn't do?
Ego, maybe.
In the poem, Dante and Virgil had roles
from which they didn't stray.
This unsub and his Virgil would do the same thing.
So who's this kid?
I don't know. He's got some relationship with the unsub.
Guys, with circles 7, 8, and 9 left, we're running out of time.
We need to dig more deeply into Nathan's life.
I think we're getting off to an icky start.
I'm done. You should go.
But--
There's nothing that you can say.
Then why did you agree to see me?
I'm not a friend. I'm not family.
Oh, is that it?
They didn't come?
I'm the only one who showed up?
Shut up.
If I was wrong, you would have called the guard over here by now.
You're afraid.
As tough as you're acting right now,
this is the scariest.
And you don't want to die.
I deserve this.
Why the heck did you call me?
Because I don't want to die alone.
I can't.
Why?
For a lot of reasons.
I--I--I--I hate--
I hate--I don't like blood.
It's an injection.
There's gotta be someone out there--
No, you were right. I got nobody.
Nobody came to visit me. Nobody called.
You're the only human that reached out to me,
in the letter.
Well, maybe the governor will still grant you a stay.
But if he doesn't...
Then I want somebody there.
I'm scared.
I don't know.
Then I was right.
You're not here for me.
You're here for yourself.
No. No. No, wait.
Let me out.
Take me back.
Wait, Greg.
I'm done.
Greg.
No--Greg--
No, Greg, wait.
Greg.
I didn't mean...
Could we...
Greg.
Greg.
No one in Nathan's life fits the profile.
Did you check people in his high school classes?
Yeah. Still coming up empty.
All right, I've got Nathan's copy of "The Inferno"
with detailed notes, but the edition is from 1986.
And if Nathan was in high school two years ago,
he would have had a more recent edition.
Is they a J. Leu anywhere in Nathan's life?
Uh, yeah. There's a Justin Leu.
He was Nathan's high school AP English teacher.
If you give a kid an early edition of a book,
it's because you had a bond.
Oh, in Nathan's digital yearbook,
he says that Mr. Leu was the only reason
he got through high school.
He took his class twice.
Is Mr. Leu still in the school system?
Yeah, he's been there for years.
From the looks of it, he's a very tough teacher.
Oh, and please remember your "Paradise lost" papers
are due next Friday.
Don't forget. Thank you.
Mr. Leu...
You can't give me a "B."
Well, that's what you got.
If I come home with a "B," My dad's gonna kill me.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
What do we know about Leu's family?
The mom passed away of cancer when Justin was 10.
Father started spiraling.
Let me see, Justin.
You got a "B"?
Todd, what did you get?
A b-minus.
How many hours did you study?
Dad...
You don't deserve to eat or sleep.
But, dad--
Shut up!
Stopped going to church, started drinking.
He was very abusive.
Social services said he often locked the kids in a shed.
Was the father violent with both boys?
Yes, but according to child protective services,
Mr. Leu's older brother Todd got the worst of it.
Justin, you shouldn't be here.
It's going to be ok. It's going to be ok.
Remember, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope...
Ye who enter here.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
And where's the brother now?
Todd?
Todd.
Todd!
Todd!
Todd!
He committed suicide.
Dad!
So that's who his Virgil is, his brother.
He's metaphorically going on this journey with him.
Maybe the father committed the sins
found within the 9 circles.
An "A"?
Are you serious?
Thanks.
Is the father still alive?
No, he passed away a couple months ago.
Justin inherited his house.
That's what triggered the killing.
All right, Kevin, send us the school address, the home address,
and his father's address.
Sent.
What am I out here? What do you want from me?
Please, please. Please, what are you doing?
Just paying you back.
You idiot.
Shut up, dad.
I'm not your dad.
What are you doing?
Are you stupid?
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Say it again.
You're weak, just like your brother.
No!
Please...
Don't hurt me!
You think this is painful?
Wait till you get to hell.
Ok, thanks.
Hotch and Rossi just left the school. Justin's not there.
What about at his apartment?
It's empty, too. He has to be headed to his father's house.
Please, I'll do whatever you want.
I just want you to be nice.
We're not perfect.
We're not perfect!
No. You're dumb!
Be quiet!
A "B" in math?
A B-minus in English?
Shut up.
You and your brother are lazy.
No, be quiet.
You should have both died back then.
FBI!
FBI. Don't do it.
Get away!
Drop that gun.
You've killed enough.
I'm not finished.
Please, help me!
Killing him's not gonna help you.
I need to finish this journey.
But you skipped number 7
and went right to 8, Justin.
Part of 7 was suicide.
You were gonna try to complete the circles
and save that for yourself.
You don't know me.
You thought that by killing yourself it would even the score.
But your brother didn't commit suicide
because he couldn't live up to your grades, Justin.
He was depressed.
No. It's my fault.
It's my fault!
It was your father's.
If he'd have gotten your brother the help he needed,
none of this would have happened.
Listen to her, Justin. Think about it.
Come on, now, it's over.
Put that gun down.
Don't let your father destroy you more than he already has.
I'm sorry, father.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hi, this is Derek Morgan. Please leave a message.
Derek, pick up the phone. I need to talk to you.
I went to go see him.
This whole thing is a mess.
I made things worse by coming here.
I thought I would come and, you know, be an uplifter.
I'm an uplifter.
Even on death row I want to be an uplifter.
I wanted to change things. But I can't change it,
I can't fix it,
because it's already in motion.
And now I'm here alone, and I know I made my choices to get here,
but I need you right now.
I don't even know what I need.
I need you to see me. I need you to witness me
as I go through this. I need to know you're out there
while I'm going through this. That's what I need.
Open the gate.
Amen.
Is there anything you want to say?
Thank you.
