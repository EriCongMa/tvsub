okay , people , we are trying to depict the sizzling final days
of the nathan lane of the new testament , jesus christ .
now remember , this is the passion play ,
not the phone it in play .
not the i once had three shows on broadway simultaneously
but i blew all my money on coke and now here i am play ,
so let &apos;s do this thing !
hi . my name is milhouse van houten ,
and i am auditioning for the role of child who points .
yeah , okay , point stage left .
i prepared right !
well , i better get going .
this is starting to feel a little churchy .
why do we have to audition for the stupid play ,
and dad gets to leave ?
i already have my part .
man who buys ticket , but doesn &apos;t show up .
also , the passion play isn &apos;t stupid .
it &apos;s the greatest story ever told .
maybe it was once ,
but now there &apos;s lots of better stories .
krusty vs. the f.d.a.
game six of the 2011 world series .
hitler mashups ! and lenny &apos;s story about cancun .
yeah , why aren &apos;t we doing lenny &apos;s story ?
that thing &apos;s hilarious .
not so hilarious for me .
i nearly lost a toe .
that &apos;s what you get
for having a monkey give you a foot massage .
my bucket list is my business .
next audition !
ah @-@ ha @-@ ha . name &apos;s ned flanders .
credits include jesus in the passion play last year ,
jesus in the passion play the year before that ,
jesus , jesus , a kindly hobo who turns out to be--
you guessed it-- saint peter ...
enough ! enough , already .
i &apos;m so bored i &apos;m ready to introduce myself
to my two assistants here .
you will be a non @-@ speaking pharisee .
but @-@ but @-@ but ...
jesus didn &apos;t stammer !
his voice hit the back of the theater !
he was a god who turned water into wine
and did not wear shoes .
he said simple things that many followed .
just like me on twitter !
我觉得能吃
and he was tragically killed while still in his 30s ...
after an all @-@ night dinner .
i &apos;m your jesus ! me !
boom . done . this guy &apos;s perfect !
you understand why god would have forsaken him .
well , congratulations , homer .
i guess this is just my cross to bear .
what &apos;s that a reference to ?
ooh , nice and roomy .
our lord sure knew how to keep &apos; em cool .
dad ?
yes , sweetie ?
first of all ,
congratulations on getting the lead .
i just hope you &apos;re going to take this seriously .
oh , yes , lisa .
very seriously .
dad , the story of the passion
is the cornerstone of the christian faith .
and although i personally follow
the enlightened teachings of lord buddha ,
messing with jesus really gets people mad .
it &apos;s like wearing a florida state jersey
to a florida game .
o lord , why have you placed
this fearsome burden on my shoulders ?
it &apos;ll be fine .
just learn your lines .
does jesus have a big part in this thing ?
he &apos;s in every scene .
what ?
why do i succeed at everything i audition for ?

dear lord , i know you see all ,
but trust me , you do not want to see this .
and so our lord was brought before pontius pilate .
what &apos;s he in for ?
he calls himself &quot; king of the jews . &quot;
oh , boy .
okay , be straight with me .
you can probably plead this down to crucifixion .
do you call yourself king of the jews ?
thou sayest it .
he &apos;s good .
wow , i &apos;m so moved i renounce science ,
with the facts , and the peer reviews ,
and the hypotheses tested by evidence .
what shall i do then with jesus ,
which is called christ ?
crucify him !
they cannot judge me .
only my father can judge me .
crucify him !
i &apos;ll take you with me , old man !
jesus was handed a heavy cross ,
and upon his brow was placed a crown ...
... of thorns .
what the ... ?
daughters of jerusalem !
weep not for me ,
but weep for yourselves .
you know , homer &apos;s giving it the old bible @-@ college try .
maybe i should &apos;ve dialed down the doubting thomas .
silence , pharisee !
looks like someone didn &apos;t follow the underwear rule !
this man is totally the son of god .
tonight you shall be at my right hand in heaven .
all right !
it pays to network at these things .
jesus cried again with a loud voice
and yielded up his spirit .
lord , forgive me for my pride .
all wise as always , you have rightly raised homer above me .
never again will i question ...
out of my way , stupid flanders ! ow !
i knew we should &apos;ve done spamalot .
i &apos;m not licked .
i &apos;ll just make them think this was planned .
who &apos;s to say
this didn &apos;t happen
who &apos;s to say
and curtain !
diddily ...
doodily ...
no atheist blood , please .
sorry , ma &apos;am , only members of the immediate family allowed in .
it &apos;s okay . she &apos;s my wife .
ned and edna , married ?
that &apos;s right . ha !
wow ! oh , my goodness .
hey , dad .
you remember when you said if flanders got remarried
you &apos;d eat your hat ?
ooh , licorice !
mmm , historically inaccurate .

well , it was nice having a secret marriage while it lasted .
well , sir , now we &apos;ll have an open marriage !
you do know what that means ?
no , but i &apos;m sure newt gingrich
wouldn &apos;t steer us wrong .
at least in the hospital
we can just enjoy a nice , quiet moment together .
congratulations , you two !
we &apos;re so , so happy for you .
welcome to marriage .
another good man bites the dust .
homer !
i &apos;m talking about this guy !
oh , i sure envy him .
homer !
i mean , i envy flanders ,
once again enjoying the joys of marriage .
let &apos;s put it to a vote , america .
enough with the voting .
ned , edna , why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
&apos;cause everyone in this town
makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything .
nedding bells are ringing .
see what happens when teachy met preachy
on channel 6,
your source for news @-@ based puns .
i was just down the hall getting some very bad news ,
and i saw there was a party going on .
congratulations from the mayor . vote quimby .
many happy returns !
hope you &apos;re both happy .
edna , as the runner @-@ up in the race for your heart ,
i would like to make a toast .
my dearest , let me be the first to offer you
the hearty handshake that would &apos;ve climaxed
our own wedding day ...
seymour , did you use my wig glue to patch your shoes again ?
i tied them together with used dental floss ,
as per your memo !
everybody out . now !
not you .
o lord , please bless our blended family .
and thank you for &quot; cigarette mommy . &quot;
oh , honey , please don &apos;t call me that .
okay , &quot; do @-@ over mommy . &quot;
boys , you will please call your new mother
whatever she feels comfortable with .
how about &quot; edna ? &quot;
it &apos;s disrespectful
to call a grown @-@ up by their first name .
yo , homer ,
mom says get your fat ass over to the flanders &apos; .
bart ! don &apos;t call me that !
which one ? &quot; homer &quot; or &quot; fat ass &quot; ?
why , you little ...
they &apos;re both bad , and i suspect you know it !
we just want to apologize ...
... for the commotion in your room .
people here do not respect boundaries .
homer , did you just buckle your belt through my loop ?
sorry .
well , we &apos;re here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor .
a little party might be fun .
the only guests at our wedding were ned &apos;s parents .
look at those squares ,
makin &apos; it nice and legal .
we didn &apos;t need a piece of paper !
we had a paper , nedward .
we just rolled it and smoked it .
oh , yeah .
we got high @-@ diddily @-@ high on that reeferino .
less news from the pews .
okay , simpsons .
well , call me a cock @-@ eyed optimist
&apos;cause i think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun !
great !
we &apos;ll take care of everything .
we &apos;ll just need to borrow your punch bowl ,
17 chairs , your portable dance floor ,
your banner printer , banner ink ,
and a ream of blank banners .
okay , there &apos;s no school ;
your dad &apos;s at work ;
and it &apos;s really coming down .
anyone for scrabble ?
only god can make words .
right , right . yahtzee ?
dice are satan &apos;s bones .
what the hey , mrs. k ?
thank god , a real kid .
you want my advice on dealing with the hardly boys ?
why do you care ?
i don &apos;t . i &apos;m just bored watching worms drown .
okay , what do you got ?
well , what you got to do is get them into the real world .
skipping is cool !
especially when you &apos;re holding hands with your brother .
if you don &apos;t act now , when they grow up ,
people like me are gonna take
all their money and girlfriends .
oh , come on . they &apos;re not that hopeless .
i &apos;m doing it ! i &apos;m doing it !
this is my third @-@ favorite wedding supply store .
whoo ! look at these .
&quot; extreme weddings .
&quot; triathlon ...
&quot; zero @-@ g ...
tie the knot at the top of mount everest &quot; ?
it &apos;s extreme enough for me
when they smear the wedding cake on each other &apos;s faces .
so , marge , the rumors are true .
why did you get to throw a party
for ned and edna and not me ?
well , you &apos;re all invited so you can make your snippy comments
while you eat my hors d &apos;oeuvres .
snippy ? how can you say that in those shoes ?
they have itchy and scratchy weddings ?
为所有左撇子人士提供一切物品
ready to go home , ned ?
i &apos;m sorry , honey ,
but i &apos;m stuck in this meeting of the springfield lgbt .
the left @-@ gifted bidextrous and transhanded community .
we &apos;re trying to decide on the theme for our left is right parade .
&quot; ourcissors , ourselves . &quot;
how about , &quot; death to righties &quot; ?
we have to live among them .
to live among them is to die .
oh , this could go late .
we haven &apos;t even ordered pizzas and pop yet .
could you handle rod and todd &apos;s
parent @-@ teacher conference for me ?
sure , i &apos;d love to be the parent for once .
now i can bring a latte
and leave the cup on the desk . ha !
sorry . i &apos;m still a pre @-@ op transhander .
well , i must say at this school
we &apos;ve never seen a step @-@ parent before .
look , i &apos;m a chalk jockey , too ,
so don &apos;t slap ketchup on bread
and tell me it &apos;s pizza friday .
you teach with that mouth ?
yes . i teach at springfield elementary ,
and we believe that ...
public school ?
well , i &apos;ll be a monkey &apos;s unrelated creature .
well , we &apos;ll fit you into our school prayers .
you do have science here , right ?
we sure do .
behold advanced astronomy .
you pulled the boys out of school ?
ned , i know i should have consulted you ,
but that school is beneath them .
take my word as a teacher of 15 years .
well , sir , when we got married ,
i knew i &apos;d find some spices in my chili .
i guess they can go to springfield hellementary .
why are we here , neddy ?
well , first of all , i think talking dogs
are the spawn of the devil .
yeah , but ...
secondly , we &apos;re watching
my little toddy graduate from college .
oh , now aren &apos;t you glad you let edna take charge
of the boys &apos; education ?
yep , it &apos;s lucky she &apos;s not in my taxes
&apos;cause i underestimated her .
wait a minute .
liberal professors ,
feminist workshops ,
abstract sculptures .
this isn &apos;t a midwestern bible college .
this is an elite east coast university .
it &apos;s okay , daddy .
i majored in religious studies .
whew !
comparative religious studies .
give me your keys !
maybe i &apos;ll just park it myself .
why are you parking yourself ?
why are you parking yourself ?
we haven &apos;t taken in one car all day .
you really put on a great reception , marge .
it &apos;s like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller .
thank you . everyone &apos;s having a great time .
helen , have a canape .
there &apos;s enough for everyone .
but not too much .
no weird hookups !
call me !
i &apos;m married to the sea ,
and i &apos;m seeing two of the great lakes on the side .
i won &apos;t say which ones ,
but it &apos;s eerie how superior they are .
so how do the boys like springfield elementary ?
marge , it &apos;s wonderful .
they &apos;re opening up , they &apos;ve seen a wider world .
i wrote with a flair pen .
well , that &apos;s just great , boys .
now come over here so mrs. simpson can take a photo .
make sure our temporary tats are in the picture .
mine &apos;s a sassy princess who speaks her mind .
mine &apos;s a duck with no pants .
what if we were raptured right now ?
ned , i said it was okay .
yeah , chillax , daddy .
chillax ? young man in the flanders &apos; house
we speak the king &apos;s diddily .
time for cake !
let &apos;s finish this sucker up .
you get my boys tattoos , you change their school ,
you buy rod sneakers
that light up like times square .
shoes are shoes and lights are lights .
now just when do i get a say
in how my boys are raised ? !
this marriage isn &apos;t perfect !
no video ! party over !
cake !
too late , marge .
ned , these boys trust me to be their mother .
you &apos;d better decide whether you do .
and that &apos;s that . another story in the classic ,
infallible three @-@ act structure .
good enough for aristotle ,
good enough for the simpsons .
mr. syzslak , i have a feeling
there &apos;s gonna be one more act to this story .
well , i &apos;m not hanging around for that .
four acts ...
ned , how did you sleep ?
fine , i guess .
thanks for loaning me your pajamas , homer .
and marge , thank you for those helpful chip bag clips .
i just felt so ashamed ,
i couldn &apos;t go home .
yesterday i gave in to the one thing
i vowed i would never have in my marriage : strong feeling .
here &apos;s your lunches ... with some cake .
you &apos;ll be having cake for a long , long time .
bart , aren &apos;t you gonna tell mom and dad
about the problem you have ?
shut up !
i &apos;m just saying it won &apos;t get better
unless you talk to an adult .
maggie knows how to keep a secret .
why can &apos;t you ?
bart , is there something you want to tell us ?
oh , marge , let the kid have
his embarrassing secrets and lies .
that is totally irresponsible parenting .
not according to the internet .
where on the internet ?
i &apos;m sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me .
why would you believe him ?
because his avatar is darth maul ,
the second @-@ coolest darth .
and what he says is true because it &apos;s in all caps .
are you gonna argue with caps ?
why does that make it right ?
he took the time to press the shift key , marge .
i think he knows what he &apos;s talking about .
so after all this time together
you two still haven &apos;t agreed
on how to raise your kids ?
ned , i realized long ago there are some things
homer and i will never completely agree on .
yeah , but we make sure
never to go to bed hungry .
it &apos;s &quot; angry . &quot;
don &apos;t tell me what our thing is !
it &apos;s about not agreeing on something .
i &apos;ve always said hungry !
bart , just tell us the problem .
i &apos;m keeping a dolphin in my bathtub !
i thought i heard clicks and pops !
children , your test scores are down
because we &apos;ve been having so many assemblies ,
you haven &apos;t had time to study .
this assembly will remedy that .
we &apos;ve invited a few friends over
to give you some musical cues .
i &apos;m sally scantron sheet .
and i &apos;m peter pencil .
now , you didn &apos;t hear it from us ,
but the answers to the test are
are you just giving them the answers ?
they still have to sign their names properly ,
so we &apos;re not totally out of woods .
pause the assembly !
i have to talk to my wife .
ned ?
my rival .
some rivalry .
it &apos;s like secretariat versus a can of dog food .
edna , i &apos;m sorry
and i &apos;ll say it in front of god
or groundskeeper willie .
oh , ned , i &apos;m sorry , too .
i overstepped your boundaries .
i guess i never really truly cared about children before .
oh , get over it .
and ned , i &apos;ll be exactly
as much mom as you want me to be .
hey , the simpsons make it up as they go along ,
and they &apos;re as happy as a ribbon in a bible .
what do you say , sweetie ?
开业大吉
