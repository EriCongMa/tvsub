I wanna be with you. I want us to have that chance.
It's spread. Stage IV lymphoma.
How long? How m... how many years?
Not years. Months.
Where's Victoria?
I don't know anything.
And I don't believe you.
I know how Victoria pulled this off.
She made it look like I attacked her in a parking garage.
She staged her penthouse to look like she was assaulted,
making the world believe that I was a monster
who burned the queen alive.
We have dental records and x-rays.
She switched them with a woman named Mary Gaines.
I found the hoodie that Victoria said
Emily was wearing when she attacked her.
You told Detective Hunter this?
I need to retain your services immediately.
You are alive.
When I was a little girl,
the delineation between good and evil
was as clear as night and day.
But as life grows complicated,
that line blurs, and we learn to justify our actions
when we believe we've crossed it.
If we aren't careful,
those choices can fill us with darkness,
leaving us destined to never see light again.
You're getting pretty good at that.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
Why are there bad people, daddy?
Is this about the crash you saw on the TV?
The flight 197?
I don't think that people are born bad.
I think it's their choices that make them who they are.
I think sometimes people convince themselves
that doing something bad is okay.
What if I do that?
You would never.
You always listen to your heart.
And if you ever go off the path,
Dad's gonna be there to bring you back.
Promise.
Detective?
Do you know when Ben Hunter's coming in this morning?
He's not.
Okay, well, this afternoon...
Detective Hunter is dead.
What?
No.
No, I can't believe that.
If you had anything to do with this,
I'm gonna find out.
Did anyone recognize you?
Nobody batted an eye.
And why would they?
Victoria Grayson's dead.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Thanks to you.
I told her to get you out of there before Ben found you.
I never expected her to...
I know that.
What that woman did to Ben was horrific.
Now all we can hope is that no more blood will be shed.
Right?
I've arranged it so that you can stay hidden here
in our new headquarters until tomorrow,
when you'll board a private jet to Montpellier.
This all started
when Amanda Clarke changed her identity.
And now it ends with me changing mine.
Did you speak to Charlotte and Patrick?
They've been invited to the funeral.
Victoria...
You know, until Emily is convicted
and you're safely abroad, you cannot contact them.
Well...
It wouldn't make any difference.
I wrote and phoned Charlotte so many times.
But I never got a response.
You know better than anyone how complicated
the relationship between a mother and a daughter can be.
Even more than you realize.
The corpse I passed off as my own
was my mother.
All rise.
Court is now in session.
The honorable judge Jesse moss presiding.
Please be seated.
Amanda,
Are you absolutely sure about this?
I'm positive.
I see both counsel are present.
Let's get started, shall we?
Your honor, on behalf of my client,
I'd like to thank you for agreeing to this hearing.
This had better be warranted, Ms. Clarke.
It is, your honor.
Well, enlighten us then, would you?
My father once said that no one is born bad,
That...it's our choices that define who we are.
By those standards,
both myself and Victoria Grayson are far from saints.
But only one of us crossed a line...
that we can't come back from.
Your honor, she's making unfounded claims
about the victim's character before the trial's even begun.
Get to the point, Ms. Clarke.
I requested to come before the court today
because there is something you need to know.
I am guilty of the murder of Victoria Grayson.
What on earth are you doing? Why did you plead guilty?
Ben is dead.
What?
He was killed last night, in his home.
They're saying it was an accident,
but I don't believe that.
He was murdered,
And it's my fault.
So you admit to killing Victoria?
That doesn't make sense.
I did it, dad.
You're lying.
You would never kill anyone. That's not who you are.
I don't care if they're listening.
I lost 20 years of my life for something I didn't do.
You can't give up now.
I don't wanna spend what's left of my life without you.
That's it, Clarke. Time's up.
Can you just give us five more minutes, please?
I love you.
Amanda. Amanda!
Emily's a genius.
How is pleading guilty
to a murder you didn't commit smart?
Oh, after my incarceration,
I decided that we needed a plan in place if...
Well, more likely "When,"
one of us ended up getting arrested again.
So I boned up on all the specs and security
For every hoosegow in a 200-mile radius.
So...Emily pled guilty so she could be moved
into a maximum security prison?
Where we're gonna move her out.
Your mother did unspeakable things to you, Victoria.
I thought you'd banished her from your life.
I did.
And in the eight years since,
I've tried never to give her a second thought.
But the night after Amanda destroyed me,
I received an unexpected call.
Victoria.
I didn't expect you'd show.
Well, if I hadn't,
You'd have thought yourself the bigger person.
Well, couldn't have that, could we?
I know you think
I was a horrible mother.
And that after you... humiliated me that thanksgiving,
I bet you hoped I'd...
curl up and die.
I loved you, mother...
So much that I took the fall for the murder that you committed,
hoping that one day you would love me back.
And instead, when I was released to you,
I found that lecherous man in our home,
waiting for me.
I didn't ask you here to fight.
I changed my name so...
there'd be no chance you could hurt me again.
And imagine my surprise when I...
I saw on television that girl
that you forced to do the same thing.
I heard about Daniel's passing,
That Charlotte is in rehab...
Again.
I even heard about...
Your bastard...
who abandoned you
just like you abandoned him.
So now you tell me, Victoria.
Who was the better mother?
I must've inherited my heart from my father.
You owe me the truth. Who was he?
Didn't you recognize him, Victoria?
That lecherous man
that you seduced into your bed...
You...
you are a cruel, loathsome bitch
who deserves to burn in hell.
Well, then...
we'll continue this conversation...
there.
It was only in death
that my mother could finally do something good
for her daughter.
You're the only family I have left,
thanks to Amanda.
I'm here for you.
But she is still a threat.
The only reason for her to confess
is that she's up to something.
Well, whatever her next move,
I will go to my grave
before I allow her to hurt my children again.
Mascelli, where's the fire?
It could be anywhere!
Open 'em up! All of 'em! Do it!
You know...
a most distinct sensation of dejavu.
Just sayin'.
Thanks for being here.
Wouldn't be anywhere else.
Well, after the number I did on their security system,
we should have plenty of time.
What's our next move?
A spot just opened up at bedford hills correctional.
I'm gonna find Victoria and put her in it.
Anyone who believes
will not come under judgment,
but has passed from death to life.
The hour's coming when the dead will hear
the voice of the son of God
And all who hear...
I can't believe they didn't show.
Victoria deserved better.
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
Most people think
they knew who Victoria Grayson was.
The strong queen of the Hamptons.
But they're wrong.
Victoria's tough exterior was merely an armor
built up to protect a heart
whose capacity to love was unmatched.
I know this...
because she opened it up to me,
embracing me as her own.
The loss of Victoria Grayson
is a tragedy.
But the real tragedy is that so few
got to experience the intensity with which she loved.
I consider myself blessed
having been a recipient of that love.
And I can only hope that while she was alive,
she felt I returned it in kind.
Thank you.
Ben would've come here from the morgue
when he realized that Mary Gaines' body was missing.
But there's no sign that he was here.
Well, maybe Victoria's henchman killed him
before he had a chance.
Who the hell is Mary Gaines, anyway?
Oh, my God.
What?
It's her mother.
Victoria burned her own mother's corpse in the fire.
That's insane.
Tell me you have something.
What, other than
your great escape trending on Twitter?
I didn't think they'd admit to losing me so quickly.
We gotta move.
You're not going anywhere, Miss America's Most Wanted!
Look, I can't get you out if you get arrested again,
so just sit tight.
I'll talk to you later.
What is it?
The floor was just cleaned,
but only in this area.
What's that look like to you?
Ben wasn't killed at home.
It happened here.
Where have you been?
Don't worry. No one saw me, not even you.
You were at your own funeral?
I'm trying to protect you.
Why must you insist on making it so difficult?!
I'm sorry...
But I wanted to see my children for one last time.
But apparently, they didn't have the same desire.
Oh, Victoria.
Louise did.
I cannot allow someone who cares about me
to languish away in unnecessary mourning.
Bring her to me. I have to tell her the truth.
You're putting our lives in the hands of an unstable woman.
You heard her eulogy. She's devoted to me.
Your journey is in enough jeopardy as it is.
Victoria, Emily is coming for us.
Well, I knew this wasn't over.
But there's one course of action we can take.
No.
No, it's out of the question.
I won't be a part of any more bloodshed.
Margaux, I never wanted Amanda Clarke dead.
I want her to be in solitary confinement
for the rest of her life.
Your contact can capture and put her there.
I say we make a run for it.
Every second we're not tracking Victoria,
she gets further away.
Nolan said to sit tight,
so that's what we're gonna do.
We need to rest.
When was the last time you actually slept?
We're not safe here, Jack. I'm not gonna sleep.
You're safe.
I'm here.
You know, when I started all of this,
I didn't know...
someone was gonna figure out what I was doing if...
if I would fail, if the whole thing would fall apart.
Remember that day...
I ran into you and Sammy in the park?
Suddenly, I felt like...
everything was gonna be okay.
You've always made me feel safe, Jack.
I know things...
got complicated since then with Aiden and Amanda...
But I never stopped feeling that way when I was around you.
I guess I'm just scared.
This whole mess isn't over yet, and I don't know
how it's gonna end.
Neither do I.
But I know
that I won't let it end...
without this.
The remains were too burnt for D.N.A.,
so all we had to go on were the teeth we recovered.
But the coroner checked her dental records.
It's definitely Victoria Grayson.
You know, I don't think Victoria would've appreciated
you pulling me out of her funeral reception early.
You need to stop burying your feelings, Margaux.
I don't understand how you can be so cold.
You will.
Hello, poppet.
Louise, you are a treasured part of my family.
Then why didn't you tell me?
Because I couldn't risk implicating you
in case something had gone awry.
And now I realize the error of my ways.
I am so sorry.
I just...
I don't understand. Where will you go?
Someplace you cannot come.
But I promise, we will be reunited one day.
Until then,
I need you to keep up the charade.
For me.
Of course.
Mama.
Now I've been looking into Margaux's finances,
and she recently wired a lot of money
into someone's encrypted account in the Caymans.
Maybe that's for Victoria. It could lead us right to her.
I thought the same thing,
but the account's been open for years,
Receiving large sums from all over the globe.
I think I may have figured out who it belongs to.
The F.B.I. have been trying to pin down
a mercenary who calls herself "White Gold."
Most people don't even believe she exists, but...
Wait. Hang on.
What is it?
David, Margaux just cut the ghost assassin
another check.
Ems.
I got it, Nolan.
Wait. Got what, Ems?
Evidence that Victoria switched the bodies.
No, no, no. That's great, but...
I found her mother's original dental records. It's all here.
Emily!
Look, you're in danger, girl.
Margaux paid a hit woman to take out Ben,
and you are next.
That's why I told you to stay at the house.
You're safe there.
No, we're not.
Ben was killed there.
If the assassin finds out, she'll retrace her steps.
Then you need to get as far away from that house as possible.
Jack's still there. I'm not just gonna leave him.
I'm going back.
No, hey, all right.
You know what? Emily, we're sending the police right now.
Do not go back there.
You do, you're either caught or you're dead.
Emily?
Emily?
Either you tell me where Amanda is and you die,
or you don't tell me and you die slower.
Go to hell.
Bad call.
Move, move!
Sir, can you hear me?
We got a man down in here.
Send 'em up asap.
Hang in there, sir.
Help is on its way.
Come on.
Hang in, buddy.
Something wrong?
Ems!
This place is crawling with cops.
I don't care.
By the time I got to Marion's house,
they were loading him in the ambulance. I had to see him.
Please don't leave me.
I need you.
I'm not gonna put Victoria in prison.
I'm gonna put her in the ground.
And don't you dare try to stop me.
I won't.
Do it.
I'm gonna take care of the bitch Margaux paid to do this.
Nolan, you can't. She's dangerous.
So am I.
I trained for four years
with the most dangerous sensei I know.
I can handle her.
We still have to find Victoria.
We don't know where she's hiding.
I do.
It's no use, Margaux.
You can't escape this.
How did you get in here? Leave now.
Doesn't matter if you admit it or not.
I have proof...
that you hired the mercenary
that murdered Ben,
put Jack in the hospital.
Jack?
W-what happened? Is he all right?
He is in critical condition, thanks to you.
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.
I was only trying to put Emily back behind bars
where she belongs.
And where do you belong, Margaux? Hmm?
You and Emily are far from innocent.
I know the crimes you've committed for her.
Can't you see that you and I are the same?
Everything we've done
was out of loyalty to the people we love.
And you crossed a line and you know it!
You took a life!
Hey, I've lost people, too!
My father! Daniel! I lost my own child!
And it doesn't matter how hard we try.
We can't get them back.
We can't undo what we've done.
Someone once told me that...
it's our decisions
that define who we are.
Well...
you've still got a decision to make.
David?
Jack. Oh, thank god.
How you feelin'?
Where's Amanda?
No, no, no. Hey.
Easy.
Nolan left me a message, said that she was okay.
I'll...
I'll let the doctor know that you're awake.
So she can check you out.
David?
Yeah?
Do you remember when Amanda and I were...
were kids, and she made us have
that little wedding on the beach?
With the...
the pipe cleaner rings, right?
Yeah.
How could I forget that?
You approved of us back then.
Would you still approve today?
Jack, you had a rough day.
No. I'm serious, david.
When this is all over, I wanna marry your daughter.
But I was hoping to have your blessing.
Well...
You have it.
I can't imagine leaving amanda in better hands than yours.
Louise.
Please stop.
I am done listening to you.
You have been using me this whole time.
I am nothing but a pawn to you.
No, poppet, I love you.
I never wanted to hurt you.
But you did.
And there's someone else you hurt much more.
Hello, Victoria.
Nolan Ross is the perfect bait.
Put him in danger, and Amanda will come.
You should consider putting me on retainer, Lady Marmalade.
This will be the last time, I assure you.
That's what they all say.
You closed?
Bummer.
Could sure use a shot.
Well, I can make an exception.
What's your poison?
Bourbon.
Now... with your free hand,
you're gonna call your bestie amanda
And you're gonna let her know that her presence is required.
You know the best thing about white gold?
It's an excellent conductor.
Oh, mon Dieu! Nolan!
It'll be all right.
I'll take a knife to the hand over 70,000 volts any day.
Here. Check my front jacket pocket.
What's this?
It's her Cayman account info.
It's tied to records of every fatal accident
she's ever staged.
Don't worry. I removed the connection to you.
I already called the police.
They'll be here in five minutes.
Margaux, you should go.
No, I'm staying.
I started this to get justice for Daniel.
He once told me not to abandon my soul like he had.
He redeemed his by saving a life.
I need to honor him and redeem mine.
Wait.
So you're just gonna give yourself up?
If it's our decisions that define who we are,
then this is who I am.
Before you fire, please know
that like your televised assassination,
your real one will be there for all the world to see.
I installed these cameras
when I heard that you had escaped,
because I knew that you would find your way here.
So you'll be going away for good once you pull that trigger.
You never really have been able to, have you?
Oh, for once, you're right about something, Victoria.
Unlike you, I've never killed anybody.
I believe that the people who hurt my family
deserve to live in agony,
not pay with their lives.
But you...
you are the one exception. For you,
death is my only true revenge.
I died long before you were born.
This...
is just a formality.
Are you ready now?
More than you know.
Goodbye, Victoria.
Dad! What the hell are you doing?! She was mine!
Saving your soul.
You have no idea what crossing that line means.
No matter how justified. It's over.
No.
What are you doing?
You devoted your life to saving me. It's my turn.
I'm not gonna lose you again.
I love you, Amanda.
And I love you, too,
which is why...
No! No!
No.
Amanda, hold on.
Amanda.
Ready to go?
That's my job, to keep you on schedule today.
I appreciate it.
I'll just be a minute.
Isn't it beautiful?
I never thought that...
I would get to sit here again.
I'm glad the judge agreed to grant you compassionate release.
You deserve this.
This...
chance to...
get to know you,
see,
the amazing woman that you've become,
has made me feel like my...
my life is complete.
I can die a happy man.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Whenever you...
miss me...
go to that post.
Go on.
Remember how much I love you.
Infinity...
times...
Infinity.
Dad?
Dad?
Upon embarking on a path of revenge,
Confucius warns that one should dig two graves.
Confucius was right.
The second of the two graves was meant for me.
I was only saved by my father's infinite love.
I know now that revenge brings only darkness.
I couldn't see the light until I considered my father's advice
to try and forgive.
It's not easy,
but my father once said that nothing worth doing ever is.
Well, with one exception.
Come in!
It's almost time.
Anything I can do?
Yeah. Can you help me with this?
You know, I was...
I was thinking about that first night at the beach house.
Called you out.
Yes. I believe I threatened to crush your windpipe.
Good times.
Oh, that night, I...
I offered to help you, too,
and you said I wasn't a part of this.
Clearly, I was wrong.
Back then,
I wasn't really part of anything.
Just.. the awkward billionaire.
No friends, no life.
The time that we spent together...
gave me purpose.
I was good at it.
Now that it's over, I just...
I don't know what's next.
Nolan.
Ems.
I'm serious.
Is there life after revenge for Nolan Ross?
Of course there is.
You will find new purpose.
Trust me.
Let's get you dressed.
I think you've made Jack wait long enough. Don't you?
Very funny.
On behalf of Amanda and myself,
I'd like to take a moment to remember
the people we love who couldn't be with us today...
My brother Declan,
who always encouraged me
to be the best man that I could be...
Emily Thorne,
to whom we both owe our lives and who brought my...
my beautiful son Carl into this world.
And my father Carl Senior,
and our friends Aiden and Ben.
And finally...
David,
who we lost earlier this year.
We miss you all more than words can say.
To David.
You know, it was David who brought
Amanda and I together as kids, and...
reunited us years later
with the passion that he instilled in his daughter.
And it's his legacy now...
that sets us off on our first journey
as husband and wife.
Amanda and I will be leaving on the boat
that he painstakingly restored for us. And...
Well, we're just lucky to have you all here with us
to... to see us off. So...
Thank you.
Now that I have all of your attention,
there's a little something
that I wanted to give my new husband.
Nolan?
I consider myself lucky.
Most morality tales don't have a happy ending.
For some reason,
karma saw fit to spare me,
but not without leaving deeply etched wounds.
Is she going to make it?
Time will tell.
What she went through was extremely traumatic,
but the surgery was a success.
Your sister owes you her life.
But she can never know how.
Or rather, who.
As you wish.
But it's extraordinary that they were a match.
Amanda's heart was damaged beyond repair.
If you hadn't volunteered Victoria's for transplant...
It's what mother would've wanted.
You had that dream again.
I just can't get it out of my head.
It's so real.
Well, it's not.
It's just a nightmare.
I'll never be able to put her behind me, will I?
I love you, Jack Porter.
I love you, Amanda Clarke.
When everything you love has been stolen from you,
consider my story
as you embark on your own journey of revenge.
Excuse me, Mr. Ross?
Amanda Clarke said that you could help me.
And always remember...
That's my mom.
What goes around, comes around.
She's innocent.
Well played, Ems.
Well played.
