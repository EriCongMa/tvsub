you need to walk in there and tell them everything , ..
about mona being &apos; a &apos; ,
shana taking over where mona left off , all of it .
are we in agreement ?
we can begin with the night that you disappeared .
i didn &apos;t disappear .
i was kidnapped and held hostage for 2 years .
ali goes rogue and we &apos;re just expected to back up her story ?
i killed her , emily , and i don &apos;t know
how i &apos;m gonna be able to live with that .
shana had been using us as target practice for months .
i sent that text .
and you &apos;re gonna wish you stayed dead .
your mother can never know what you told me .
mrs. d wrote that email the night
that she skipped town , but she never sent it .
jason , why were you in new york ?
you think i &apos;m the one who kidnapped her ?
don &apos;t ! no , jason !
are you okay ?
can we get you something ?
something to eat ?
some water ?
just leave her alone .
i think you girls should go .
but , mr. dilaurentis ...
she &apos;s been through a lot .
but ...
he &apos;s right .
we should all get out of here .
do you want me to help you get dressed ?
no .
do you think there are gonna be a lot of people at the funeral ?
i don &apos;t know .
you can go downstairs .
i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
okay .
i don &apos;t want to see any police--
not at the funeral , not at the cemetery .
no police , no press .
i took care of it .
did you ?
yes , i did .
hey , how is she ?
she &apos;s getting dressed .
yeah , but how is she ?
she &apos;s going to her mom &apos;s funeral .
how do you think she is ?
she &apos;s going to bury the woman who tried to bury her .
question is ,
who buried ali &apos;s mom in spencer &apos;s backyard ?
it wasn &apos;t jason .
what makes you so sure ?
because i saw his face when ...
the dog found the body .
a dog who knows where the body was buried ?
that sounds exactly like &apos; a.&apos;
dogs dig . okay ? that &apos;s just what they do .
they smell something and they dig .
you didn &apos;t have to mention the smelly part .
aria , &apos; a &apos; is gone .
you know that .
yeah , &apos; a &apos; might be gone ,
but we still have to deal with mona .
she knows that ali wasn &apos;t kidnapped .
got in ali &apos;s face about it .
she &apos;s not the only one we have to worry about .
noel kahn ?
who &apos;s going to do whatever is best for noel kahn .
that &apos;s not who i was thinking of .
that &apos;s not the dress we picked out .
that &apos;s not hers , but i &apos;ve seen it somewhere .
why are you wearing that dress ?
i wanted to wear something of mom &apos;s to feel close to her .
i got it out of her closet .
change it .
dad .
why ?
go upstairs and put on something else .
we &apos;re late now .
i just wanted to wear something of hers .
why is he so angry ?
ali , your mother wore that dress .
i know .
she wore it to your funeral .
we should go .
come on .
coincidences happen .
yeah , all the time .
they grow on trees , like coconuts .
just waiting for you to walk under them .
the four of you have had a very stressful week .
i want you to know how legitimately relieved
we all are that you &apos;re safe
and what it means to have you back
in the halls of rosewood high school .
we &apos;re happy to be back .
but i would be disingenuous to say
that things will be as they were before ,
at least in the short term .
i think we understand that .
as i told your parents ,
the school will protect you
from the press and the curious .
we appreciate that , mr. hackett .
but there are limits to what we can do
under these unusual circumstances .
i need to know that you will do your part
to keep the disruptions to a minimum .
you won &apos;t even know that we &apos;re here .
god , hackett wishes we transferred
to a high school in borneo .
maybe coming back wasn &apos;t such a good idea .
we have to at least act like things are normal .
this is your idea of normal ?
when we were in new york , ali &apos;s mom was killed
and now we &apos;re in one of ali &apos;s biggest lies ever .
we can &apos;t pretend forever .
somebody &apos;s gonna connect all this to shana .
yeah , probably jenna .
i &apos;m more worried about the people who already know
that ali was lying about new york .
noel and mona ?
and ezra .
you know , somebody has to go talk to him
and make sure he &apos;s gonna keep quiet
about what really happened .
not me .
aria .
he &apos;s alive , he &apos;s safe , but we are over .
you guys can ask me to do anything else ,
but you can &apos;t ask me to do that .
mr. dilaurentis kept the cops away
before the funeral , but that &apos;s over .
i mean , it &apos;s not gonna take them long
before they start punching holes in ali &apos;s kidnap story .
and when that happens ,
i mean , we have to have something
real to give to the police
to explain why alison lied and why we backed her up .
real such as ?
real as in who hit alison that night
and who killed mrs. d.
we &apos;re all thinking the same person .
really , did you start reading minds ?
spencer , it has to be jason .
i told you , guys , i saw his face .
hanna found the email where mrs. dilaurentis was telling him
she couldn &apos;t protect him anymore .
protect him from what ?
he was the one who hit alison that night .
we don &apos;t know that .
it makes sense .
mrs. d saw who hit alison .
and what did she do ? she covered up the crime .
who else would you have done that for ?
we should probably go inside .
she doesn &apos;t think that jason would do this .
jason &apos;s her half @-@ brother .
she &apos;s going to take some more convincing .
do you want to do a trip to philadelphia tonight ?
what &apos;s in philadelphia ?
i want to know what &apos;s in that house jason went to .
i can &apos;t tonight .
why ? are you hanging out with travis ?
no . i have to be with ali .
i have to take her somewhere .
where ?
the funeral home .
welcome back to these hallowed halls .
thanks .
oh , i wanted to make sure i found you
before all the good spaces were taken .
mr. fitz &apos;s get @-@ well card .
you know what happened to him in new york .
yeah , he was mugged .
he was shot , but he &apos;s back now .
wait a second . what do you mean that he &apos;s back ?
not here , not in school . in rosewood .
recuperating .
you didn &apos;t know that part ?
no .
don &apos;t you want to sign the card ?
i think that you should , for the sake of appearances .
we all have to be careful how others see us .
i heard you were floating around with this .
are you going to give it to him ?
maybe with candy ?
well , they said that he was shot in the stomach ,
so i thought flowers .
ah , good choice .
sign .
what &apos;s it going to be like
when ali comes back to rosewood high ?
oh , come on .
if she &apos;s still ali , she wants to come back ,
pick up where she left off .
and look at that story she &apos;s got to tell .
all that drama and danger and suspense .
couldn &apos;t be more exciting if she made up the whole thing .
hey , mona , have you seen noel kahn ?
oh , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s around somewhere getting into mischief .
she said that ezra &apos;s back in rosewood .
sorry .
i wasn &apos;t following you . i just saw you dropped that .
thank you .
i &apos;m really sorry about what happened to alison .
are you sorry about anything else ?
i &apos;ve had all the being @-@ stared @-@ at i can handle for one day .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i know her . she &apos;s on the team , she just transferred in .
it &apos;s not important . forget it .
nice having emily back , isn &apos;t it ?
you haven &apos;t signed the card for mr. fitz .
can i help you with something ?
sorry ?
people have been staring at me and my friends all day .
so why don &apos;t you take a really good look ,
and we can all move on with our lives , okay ?
and , yes , i know the dead girl who isn &apos;t dead anymore .
okay ?
i was just looking at your trophies .
my what ?
the trophies in the case .
you &apos;re emily fields ,
your name is on all the trophies .
i figured out who you were when i saw you talking to paige .
i &apos;m on the team with her .
i &apos;m sydney driscoll .
sorry for shouting .
i thought you &apos;d be taller .
what ?
i mean , you &apos;re tall , but i thought you &apos;d be taller .
all the trophies .
i figured you had an advantage .
being tall helps ,
but not as much as everybody thinks .
they said you hurt your shoulder .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not on the team anymore .
you must miss it .
i do .
listen , i transferred 3 weeks ago ,
i &apos;m bottom of the roster
and i can use all the help i can get .
what does that have to do with me ?
watch me in the pool .
fifteen minutes , and then tell me what you think .
please ?
don &apos;t let them catch you looking .
what do you think ? somebody &apos;s gonna throw a rock ?
it &apos;s a possibility .
they hate us enough .
we &apos;re not exactly the hatfields and the mccoys .
nothing so rustic .
more like the borgias and the medicis .
that ended pretty nasty as well , too .
a lot of matricide .
you think that jason killed his mother .
people are capable of all sorts of things
under the right pressures .
well , there &apos;s plenty of pressure right here in this house .
why did you send toby after me ?
i didn &apos;t .
he went on his own .
why did you lie about seeing him in london when you hadn &apos;t ?
on a practical level , there &apos;s no difference between me
seeing him and knowing he was there .
then on a practical level , why lie about it ?
i was trying to keep wren out of it .
mom and dad are worried enough without me
dragging him back into things .
and who do you think they &apos;re more worried about , me or you ?
worry less about me , spencer , and more about yourself .
you brought alison back home , safe and sound .
good for you .
frankly , i wish you would have left her
where you found her , but you didn &apos;t .
she &apos;s back in the bosom of what &apos;s left of her family .
now stay away from her and the rest of them .
i &apos;m related to parts of that family .
and so are you .
and blood is thicker than water ?
that &apos;s what they say .
it can also be very slippery .
he could &apos;ve just dropped the damn visitation back at my house .
he said he wanted to meet you .
everybody wants to meet me .
god , i hate these places .
nobody likes them .
well , i hate them .
my mom always wanted me
to understand the fragile nature of life
so she dragged me to all of my relatives &apos; funerals
starting from the time i was seven .
all these people i didn &apos;t know standing around crying ,
me choking on the smell of flowers .
god .
i &apos;ll be right back .
do you want me to come with you ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry you had to wait .
it &apos;s fine . it was only a minute .
thank you .
i only got back to town yesterday .
i spoke with your father on the phone .
you did ?
i like to meet as many family members as i can .
that &apos;s why i wanted to give you that in person .
if i could have returned for your mother &apos;s services ,
i would have .
my mother ? i ...
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s alison dilaurentis .
are you mr. donahue ?
yes .
i apologize .
mr. thorpe told me that alison dilaurentis was here
and from the description i had i just assumed that ...
this is my friend hanna .
it used to be a little easier to tell us apart , wasn &apos;t it ?
sad , sad , sad .
how are you , hanna ?
i &apos;m okay .
two months .
that &apos;s not good .
they say the longer someone &apos;s missing
the less likely they &apos;ll ever come back .
where are your glasses ?
i don &apos;t wear them anymore .
you look different .
look how pretty she is .
ever wonder what you &apos;d look like
on one of those flyers ?
probably just put a blank space instead of a picture .
if alison &apos;s really gone ,
someone has to take her place .
what do you mean , &quot; if she &apos;s really gone &quot; ?
do you want to know the secret ?
what secret ?
the secret to becoming unforgettable .
hanna ?
let &apos;s go .
how long are they going to keep us out of the backyard ?
the police still consider it an active crime scene .
what &apos;s gonna happen when the tape comes down ?
how would you feel about selling the house ?
i don &apos;t know .
think about it .
you know , when you sell a house ,
don &apos;t you have to inform the buyer of things like
mold and termites and dead bodies ?
well , we might have to knock
a few thousand off the asking price .
yeah . life is full of sacrifices .
stay or go , we &apos;re finished with that family .
you know , dad , we can sell the house ,
we can move away ,
but we will always be connected to that family .
and you know why .
sometimes complicated problems have simple solutions , spencer .
melissa thinks that jason killed his mother .
that &apos;s for the police to determine .
well , it &apos;s not her job to point them in his direction .
what do you want me to do ?
stop her .
spencer , anything that gets the police
to look anywhere other than this house is a good thing .
for all of us .
you know , dad , forget about selling the house .
we can just put a koi pond out back .
somebody already dug a hole .
so i have my own healthcare professional ,
mrs. esther walling .
she comes over every day .
it &apos;s very nice .
she says that i &apos;m her favorite gunshot victim .
look , i know i promised
that i wouldn &apos;t come back here .
but i don &apos;t really have anywhere else to go .
how do you feel ?
how do i feel ?
i feel like a turkey that &apos;s been carved up
and then sewn back together .
nothing really feels like it &apos;s in the right place .
my counselor says that &apos;s ...
post @-@ surgical mind @-@ body dysphoria .
it &apos;s supposed to go away , though .
do you know everything that &apos;s happened with alison ?
only what i &apos;ve seen on the tv .
she told the police that she was kidnapped
and that you found her in philadelphia .
is that the story you all agreed upon ?
well , it &apos;s the story that she told , so ...
and we have to live with it ?
that &apos;s the deal ?
yeah . at least for now .
do you know about mrs. dilaurentis ?
i know she was murdered .
and i thought shana did it ,
but the timing doesn &apos;t really work out .
i had everything backwards .
but once i knew that shana was following you
and then i saw her in new york
dressed like that , well , i knew she was &apos; a &apos; then .
have you heard from her at all since you &apos;ve been back ?
no .
you have to be careful then ,
because she &apos;s clearly still out there .
yeah , well , there &apos;s cops at rosewood high and all over town ,
in case ali &apos;s kidnapper comes back .
you need to be careful .
all of you .
i better go .
that &apos;s a new lock .
let me get that for you .
thanks for coming and for letting me see you .
yeah , i wanted to see you .
i watched your videos .
i &apos;m trying to match your stroke rate .
my stroke rate won &apos;t work for you .
because you &apos;re taller than me ?
no , it &apos;s not the height , it &apos;s your ratio .
of what to what ?
well , what &apos;s your ape index ?
my what ?
stand up against the locker ,
touch the floor with your middle finger .
okay , now reach up with your other hand
and stretch out as far as you can .
now stand up with your back against the locker .
it &apos;s about 3 inches .
your ape index is negative three .
should i be taking something for that ?
no , no , it just means that your reach
is 3 inches less than your height .
so ?
so if you don &apos;t have long arms ,
don &apos;t copy swimmers who do .
emily has great arms .
for swimming .
just adjust your stroke rate .
did you two spend a lot of time together ?
training ?
not really .
not one @-@ on @-@ one .
but we were together .
in the pool .
and out .
in and out .
of the pool .
right .
well , i &apos;m gonna change now .
okay .
abracadabra .
now we have to do something about this ,
because you need a new wardrobe to go
with your new silhouette .
hanna ?
that was ali &apos;s .
she left it here after a sleepover one night .
try it on .
it &apos;s not gonna fit .
try it .
it fits .
like it was made for you .
see ? everything &apos;s better with a friend .
so what did he say ?
he heard about the story of you being kidnapped .
and ?
and he said he &apos;s not gonna say anything different if anyone asks .
good . that &apos;s one less problem .
does he know ... about shana ?
no .
it &apos;s better that he doesn &apos;t .
look , mona thinks that you &apos;re coming back to rosewood high .
does she ?
yeah .
she could really create some trouble if you did .
mona and ezra know that you weren &apos;t kidnapped , ali .
but ezra doesn &apos;t look at the world the way mona does .
ezra &apos;s not a bad guy , aria .
he &apos;s just too romantic for his own good .
that &apos;s probably why you fell for him .
okay , i really don &apos;t need you analyzing my personality right now .
here .
this is what you asked for .
keep it . burn it . i don &apos;t care .
do you need anything else ?
shana tried to kill ezra ,
and she would have killed all of us
if you didn &apos;t stop her .
do you need anything else ?
no .
hey , you girls looking for a sub @-@ let still ?
we weren &apos;t really honest with you the last time we were here .
no kidding .
you make a good watchdog , arnie .
i was talking to your friend
who owns the pizza shop down the street .
he says that you &apos;re a regular customer and a good tipper .
three pies , two , three times a week .
you feeding an army in there ?
what kind of army orders all that pizza
and no beer to go with it ?
what do you want ?
we &apos;re looking for a friend .
his name is jason .
i need to make amends for something .
are you an old drinking buddy of his ?
is that what this is ?
this is where jason came to get sober
when he said he was at clark .
when was he here ?
my dad &apos;s not here .
you &apos;re the one that i wanted to see .
are you leaving ?
funeral &apos;s over .
mother &apos;s gone , dad doesn &apos;t need me .
if anybody wants me , they &apos;ll find me .
look , what happened to your mother ...
my mother had a lot of secrets .
too many .
that &apos;s what really killed her .
and alison ?
alison .
i come into this room and see her sitting
at the piano or catch a glimpse of her
going around a corner upstairs , and i think to myself
this is what it &apos;s like to live in a haunted house .
i decided i didn &apos;t like it .
i think you need to look at this .
your mother wrote this the night that she died .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how i got it .
i got a pretty good idea how you got it .
if mrs. dilaurentis didn &apos;t send that email to jason ,
then who was it for ?
all we know for sure is it wasn &apos;t jason .
he was at that dry @-@ out place
with no less than half a dozen people
the night his mom died , and we were in new york .
so he &apos;s in the clear .
you sound disappointed .
no .
a little . i just thought that we had something .
what was it like to come out ?
where is this coming from ?
i just never really asked you .
i mean , what was it like to stop being one thing
and then just become something else ?
i wasn &apos;t becoming something else .
i was becoming who i really am .
you always knew ?
i couldn &apos;t admit it .
but you knew ?
yeah .
not me .
i never knew who the hell i was .
that time stamp means
that your mother wrote that 2 hours after the last time
anybody saw her at that police station .
and she never finished writing it .
she didn &apos;t even enter an address
to whom she meant to send .
maybe she changed her mind .
what would make her do that ?
what would make you chang your mind ?
a message like that ...
is something that i would want to deliver personally .
so she got up from her computer ,
she walked out the front door
and she went to go tell somebody
that ali was alive and that things
were falling apart faster than anybody could fix them .
too bad she never got to give the message .
what if she did ?
maybe that person , the person she was writing to ,
the one that she couldn &apos;t protect anymore ,
maybe that &apos;s who killed her .
any idea who that could be ?
yeah , tons of ideas .
all of them pretty nasty .
there &apos;s a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings :
do you want to be right or do you want to be happy ?
i don &apos;t have that choice .
i never did .
cut your losses , spencer .
get out while you still can .
then remember , you can &apos;t trust him .
i can &apos;t trust who ?
our father .
i &apos;m glad you were on that roof .
you saved us . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
we were scared that you were gonna die , ezra .
so was i.
i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t .
why are you here , alison , with that ?
aria let me read it .
i was looking for something .
did you find it ?
not all of it .
not what i need to know if i &apos;m gonna stay alive .
there &apos;s more , isn &apos;t there ?
all the watching , all the listening that you did .
you didn &apos;t destroy all of it . you couldn &apos;t have .
if there was anything left ,
the only thing preventing me from burning it
is the possibility that it would help aria ,
if she would let me help .
well , then you better keep it in a safe place .
did aria know you were coming here ?
no .
tell her .
absolute honesty ?
that &apos;s all i got left .
i hope it &apos;s enough .
do you want anything to eat ?
no , just coffee .
you &apos;re gonna have a coffee this late ?
seven @-@ tenths of my body is made up of caffeine .
i have to maintain a consistent level .
order for me ?
hi there , girly @-@ girl .
i need to ask you a question .
shoot .
metaphorically speaking .
when you and i were going through
glamour boot camp together , you knew ali was alive .
is that what she told you ?
well , it &apos;s the truth , isn &apos;t it ?
the point is she was gone .
that could either create a hole or an opportunity for you and me
to help each other up the pyramid .
you didn &apos;t help me , you changed me .
you made me dye my hair , you made me wear her clothes ,
you made me walk like her , talk like her .
and exactly how much pushback did i get from you on that ?
ali was gone , but you wanted her back .
why ?
reality check ? you didn &apos;t like being hefty hanna
anymore than i liked being loser mona .
how about a little gratitude ?
gratitude for what ?
if i hadn &apos;t given you the ali upgrade ,
where would you be ?
i &apos;d still be me .
and who remembers her ?
not even you .
and then emily texts from the car
that jason has an alibi
for what happened in new york and rosewood .
wait . jason actually told you
that you shouldn &apos;t trust your own father ?
more than that .
he made it seem like mrs. d was writing
to my dad , &quot; i can &apos;t protect you anymore . &quot;
that &apos;s crazy .
well , crazy , as you know ,
around here works on a sliding scale .
i mean , look , i know that i didn &apos;t kill
that girl in ali &apos;s grave , i know that .
but i can &apos;t prove it and i really think
that my parents don &apos;t believe me .
they wouldn &apos;t do anything about that , would they ?
that &apos;s a very interesting question ,
and i will have to get back to you on it .
i &apos;m so sorry you had to go talk to ezra .
yeah , well , we had to know
what he was going to say about new york .
but somebody else could have gone and done that .
no , not really .
are you okay ?
do you need anything ?
yeah , i need to know that it didn &apos;t happen .
shana in the theater .
but it did .
alison ?
hey , i thought that was you . wasn &apos;t sure .
hello , mr. hastings .
how are you doing ? you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine .
thanks .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m a little surprised to see you out here
all by yourself .
i can &apos;t hide in my room forever .
even if i &apos;m still scared i have to get out
or else i never will .
yeah , but you have police at the house , right ?
i do .
but i know my way around this town
better than any cop .
i can get out if i want to .
yeah , maybe , but under the circumstances ,
i think it &apos;d be a good idea if i gave you a ride home .
does my mom know you &apos;re out here ?
she said i could wait inside .
i told her i was okay here .
your mom knows we &apos;re fighting .
we &apos;re not fighting .
we &apos;re done fighting .
which makes us what ?
we go to the same school , we used to be teammates ,
maybe we &apos;ll be friends .
i practiced what i &apos;m gonna say to you .
did you know that ?
i talked to myself the whole way over here .
i &apos;m pretty convincing .
then i get to this porch and i forget everything .
all i can say is , &quot; i love you . &quot;
like if i say it just right , it &apos;ll fix things .
somehow you &apos;ll hear it differently this time
and everything will be all right .
i &apos;m sorry .
that doesn &apos;t sound very good .
i better go .
paige ...
you deserve the best of everything .
that &apos;s what i had .
where have you been at this hour , young man ?
okay , hear me out .
pretzels that i will share with you
if you don &apos;t tell your mother .
deal .
you know the world &apos;s in a sorry state
when i have to make a secret out of eating salt .
mrs. dilaurentis wrote this the night that she died
after she got back from the police station .
she never sent it .
i think she wanted to deliver it in person
and that &apos;s why she &apos;s dead .
is this a magic trick ?
are you going to make it disappear ?
this doesn &apos;t mean anything .
every thing means something , dad .
who was she trying to protect
and why did she suddenly feel like she had to stop ?
was it because alison was alive ?
who was she writing this to ?
leave him alone .
we &apos;re having a conversation .
i know what your idea of a conversation is .
don &apos;t worry about that .
oh , that &apos;s a grand gesture ,
but it doesn &apos;t amount to anything in a digital age .
this woman was crazy .
she was crazy and afraid .
enough ! both of you .
people are dead , you two are acting like
cranky little 5 @-@ year @-@ olds
on the way back from the beach .
no more friendly fire .
have i made myself clear ?
dad , maybe we should tell her .
no . don &apos;t .
spencer , go upstairs .
what ?
go upstairs .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
do i look like i &apos;m kidding ?
maybe that &apos;s a good idea , spencer .
what is going on ?
it &apos;s complicated .
no , actually , it &apos;s simple .
you can &apos;t lie about something you don &apos;t know anything about .
i meant to warn you that alison might stop by .
i just didn &apos;t think that she &apos;d move so fast .
i just heard a knock on the door
and i thought it might be you .
i don &apos;t know why .
i honestly thought i would never see you again .
yeah , i was kind of thinking the same thing .
but here i am once again , back at the scene of the crime .
there &apos;s no crime here .
not the way i see it .
look , ezra , i didn &apos;t just come over here
to warn you about alison .
i came here to tell you something
that i should have told you before .
aria , you don &apos;t need to tell me anything .
no , listen .
you don &apos;t have to worry about shana anymore .
she &apos;s dead .
and i know that she &apos;s dead , because i &apos;m responsible .
wh @-@ what do you mean &quot; responsible &quot; ?
i mean that i killed her ...
in new york after i left the hospital .
i just meant to stop her . i never meant to kill her .
anyway , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been telling myself .
but it was just in that moment ,
i don &apos;t know .
how can i help ?
same shade of blonde this time ?
no , not the same .
it &apos;s time for a change .
