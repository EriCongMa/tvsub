&quot; the face of change &quot;
i &apos;m not big into change .
okay , great .
um , now let &apos;s just try a few
where you &apos;re actually smiling .
in oncology , when a normal cell
changes into something malignant ,
it &apos;s called cellular transformation .
look , i don &apos;t even want to be the hospital mascot ,
whatever you do--
brand ambassador ,
and you haven &apos;t been appointed yet .
you &apos;re just a very strong contender .
handsome , good with kids ...
just what the buyers want .
i &apos;m outta here .
the damn cells turn toxic right in front of your eyes .
so as far as i &apos;m concerned ...
look , you &apos;re going to have some public relations reps
following you around tomorrow .
try and be civil .
transformation sucks .
brand ambassador ? what does that even mean ?
you get to wear a funny hat
and cut things with oversized scissors ?
all i know is , cahill creeps me out .
that creeps me out .
who comes over to somebody else &apos;s house
and starts sucking face ?
you invited &apos; em .
what &apos;s that ?
we are directly underneath yang &apos;s room ,
and owen &apos;s visiting .
what do you think ?
is that him or her ?
do napkins work as earplugs ?
what the hell ?
you &apos;re nuts .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know . a giraffe . dinosaur .
for the millionth time ,
jo and i are not into each other .
oh , please .
you and ponytail @-@ mcgee were canines in heat last night .
literally .
told you they were doing it , avery .
pay up .
i don &apos;t like him like that .
guys don &apos;t just hang out with girls .
it &apos;s not in their d.n.a.
that &apos;s not true .
okay , it &apos;s true .
you two are , like , one drink away
from crazy monkey sex .
just stuff her turkey . you &apos;ll feel better .
i feel fine .
look , i &apos;m not screwing my ex every night
and i &apos;m not taking advantage of interns ...
on someone else &apos;s sofa .
you &apos;re gonna pay to have that thing disinfected .
not taking advantage . it &apos;s a really nice sofa , though .
hey , apes .
hey , here &apos;s a question .
um , what ever happened
to good old @-@ fashioned romance ?
no stuffing of turkeys or disinfecting sofas ,
but , you know , what about nice normal dates
where people talk ,
share a meal , get to know each other ,
and then wind up together , not because they &apos;re monkeys ,
but because they have genuine feelings
in a committed way .
i mean , what is so wrong with that , huh ?
are you gonna eat all of those ?
y-- unh--
i like this , seeing you every morning .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s nice .
yeah , it is .
it &apos;s really nice .
i feel bad , though .
i mean , you guys shouldn &apos;t even be here
now that the e.r. is closed .
nicole &apos;s just standing out there .
you sure you don &apos;t want your seat back ?
aren &apos;t you cold ?
my burrito will keep me warm .
you okay ?
you seem a little off .
yeah .
i worked all night .
do you know how boring a night shift is
with no incoming traumas ?
i was praying someone &apos;s appendix would burst
just to keep me awake .
i--how am i supposed to train to be a trauma surgeon
with no e.r. ,
no trauma ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m , uh , tired and i &apos;m venting .
dispatch to unit 33,
we &apos;ve got a 55 @-@ year @-@ old male with chest pain ,
prior m.i. , near pioneer square . over .
unit 33 responding .
you have to go already ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
you want to come , too ?
you &apos;re with me
all day ?
we just want to get to know who you are , dr. karev .
see you in your element .
it &apos;s important we choose just the right ambassador
for our brand .
your brand ? this hospital isn &apos;t a luxury car .
hold please .
uh , good morning , dr. karev .
pre @-@ rounds went well . got your scans .
do you want to tell me who the creepy lady is
taking our photo ?
uh , i &apos;m amrita .
i do public image assessment for pegasus horizons .
they &apos;re buying the hospital ,
and they want a face to slap on some posters .
and they chose you ?
maya noel , 13 days old
with gastroschisis and staged silo repair .
she was born with her intestines outside of her body .
they &apos;ve been too swollen to fit back inside .
is that ... am i looking at a bag of organs ?
we &apos;ve been gradually compressing the organs a little bit each day
to help them fit back inside the body .
imagine going two weeks without getting to hold your own baby .
well , good news .
looks like we &apos;re finally gonna be able to close her up .
today is the day .
oh , my god .
oh , thank you .
thank you ! thank you ! thank you ! thank you !
hold please .
thanks , guys .
if i could just have you sign this release .
yeah .
these are real people with sick kids .
this is not a photo op .
i was just trying--
look , i don &apos;t care , all right ?
the next kid i &apos;m about to go see
is a very sensitive case .
all right ? you don &apos;t say a word .
you do not take a photo .
you &apos;re a shadow , a freaking shadow . got it ?
protective of your patients . passionate . i like it .
forget it . you &apos;re waiting in the hall .
great . great .
now if you could just ...
move a little closer to her--him .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m the him . she &apos;s the her .
i @-@ i--no , i was born a her , and jess was a him .
i get it &apos;s confusing .
yeah . you &apos;re kidding .
cahill &apos;s got more of you guys trailing me ?
he &apos;s &quot; trailing me . &quot;
it &apos;s for this brand ambassador thing or something .
it &apos;s not a-- not a big deal .
just , uh , we &apos;ll be done in a sec .
ready ? one , two , and three .
how &apos;s that ?
you really think it &apos;s okay
to let these people in here ?
the patient &apos;s fine with it .
if he gets to stay , i get to stay .
it &apos;s the ambassador thing .
you think this kid makes you look good .
i always look good .
we &apos;re at u.w. together .
i &apos;m a sophomore , and brian &apos;s a freshman .
and is that where you met ?
uh , actually , no . uh , dr. karev introduced us .
a few years ago , i booked an appointment
to see how old i had to be to ,
you know , start the process .
he was 14 .
and , uh , dr. karev told me
about this transgender support group .
that &apos;s where jess and i met .
brian walked in that first day ,
and all i could think was ,
oh , my god .
he &apos;s so cute .
i thought he &apos;d never notice me .
it &apos;s impossible not to notice you .
i &apos;ve been saving up for this ever since that appointment .
well , dr. karev , you really changed brian &apos;s life .
well , you could also say that i &apos;m changing brian &apos;s life ,
today , in surgery ,
where i &apos;ll be taking the lead .
and what is today &apos;s surgery exactly ?
a full gender reassignment ?
oh , no . uh , nothing that drastic yet .
today we &apos;re just chopping off my boobs .
all right , enough questions .
uh , edwards , wilson , take these guys outside .
jackson avery as the new face of seattle grace ...
now that makes sense .
alex also makes sense .
if you want a face that &apos;s unshaven
and sweating light beer .
you &apos;ve got this in the bag .
walk with me . here &apos;s what i know .
they like avery &apos;s looks and they like his name .
now you don &apos;t have either of those .
gee , thanks .
but you have africa .
lead with africa .
he &apos;s a scrapper and a fighter .
now some people find that charming ,
but you &apos;re an avery .
use it . own it . impress them .
they want to be impressed .
and i saw your breakfast .
your brain can &apos;t function on powdered sugar .
here .
oh , you just carry those around in your pocket ?
every time i touch this thing , it deletes another patient .
it deletes a patient ?
i did the exact same thing this morning .
here . let me see ...
who are your stalkers ?
oh , uh , the new guys
are looking for a hospital show pony--
a face for the brochure .
yeah , karev &apos;s my competition .
mm . if you can call it that .
you can &apos;t .
bite me , pretty boy .
and why are there no women in the running ?
oh , there was . i turned them down .
this face only goes on the nobel brochure .
and here we have
a fully centralized electronic records system .
everything you need to know about any client at anytime .
smart , streamlined , efficient--
oh , efficient .
it would be more efficient
if it didn &apos;t keep deleting my patients .
sing it , grey .
don &apos;t encourage her .
why not ? cahill deserves it .
this morning she gave me this whole load of crap
about how to talk to the buyers .
emphasize sports medicine . don &apos;t emphasize my research .
she doesn &apos;t want anything to jeopardize the sale ,
and neither should you .
research is risky .
the suits don &apos;t like it .
whereas , if you &apos;ve got the seahawks as patients ...
ah . she doesn &apos;t call &apos; em &quot; patients . &quot;
she calls &apos; em &quot; clients , &quot; like we &apos;re ,
oh , i don &apos;t know , real estate agents .
real estate agents look happy .
maybe we &apos;ll be happy .
their benefits package says they have dental ,
including orthodontics .
now i happen to have a family history
of very straight teeth ,
but tuck may grow up and need braces .
i don &apos;t know .
but if he does , they have dental .
that &apos;s--i &apos;m just gonna focus on that .
no , no , no . we cannot settle .
we have to rise up and we have to do something .
you &apos;ve done plenty .
maybe those of us from the plane
should keep our heads down for a while .
am i crazy ?
i mean , am i the only one that thinks
these ... wonks are gonna destroy the place ?
no .
you &apos;re not crazy at all .
i just felt like , what kind of doctor would i be
if i didn &apos;t try to help out all those african kids .
it takes a lot of dedication
to get a program like that off the ground .
this is your fault .
you put these ideas into her head .
his head .
and while i do support the decision ,
believe me , he came to it all on his own .
she &apos;s barely out of high school ...
he .
for god sake .
she is a child !
he .
she doesn &apos;t know what she wants !
he ! he !
jess , is everything okay here ?
are you the one ?
what ?
are you the one ...
who wants to hack my little girl into pieces ? !
hey , hey , calm down .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
通向更好的明天
pegasus ...
racing you to a brighter tomorrow .
i &apos;m gonna hurl .
click there where it says &quot; hospitals . &quot;
holy crap .
they must own half the hospitals in the country .
they &apos;re the guys who bought out portland gen last year .
right there .
hey , look at this .
&quot; hand in hand , we &apos;ll walk together ,
partners on the road to your brighter tomorrow . &quot;
this is who &apos;s buying us .
that &apos;s a cute logo . sofia would like it .
she likes horses .
it &apos;s not a horse . it &apos;s a pegasus .
and it wants to hold your hand .
this web site has
not one tangible piece of information
about the company or health care .
why doesn &apos;t this bother you ?
it does , but they &apos;re buying us .
and we are all about to gallop down the road
towards a brighter tomorrow .
so , you know , cool your heels .
chill out . there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
she just told me to cool my heels .
have you ever known me to cool my heels ?
how do you feel about a road trip ?
i &apos;m sorry . i ... lost my cool .
you think ?
it &apos;s just , i learned about this surgery last night
in an e @-@ mail .
i mean , a stupid e @-@ mail .
i had no idea about ...
any of this .
guys , you can go .
we &apos;re fine here . scram .
let &apos;s go .
a surgery like this
is a big adjustment for any parent ,
let alone if you &apos;re hearing about it for the first time .
so let &apos;s just take a breath and ...
dad .
what are you doing here ?
my name &apos;s calliope ...
plant ...
tain .
plantain .
and this is ...
my husband .
um , uh ... julio plantain .
and he needs a doctor .
can i see some i.d. ?
he has chest pain .
so by the end of this seminar ,
i expect all of you to be able to perform
basic wound closures
using the interrupted 2 @-@ layer technique .
i don &apos;t like that guy in the back .
i can feel him watching me .
no , it &apos;s just me .
i like to look at you .
quick question , dr. avery .
do you use this technique more often
when you perform butt lifts or breast implants ?
actually , isn &apos;t this the technique
you used to attach the face
on to your last face transplant patient ?
well , i &apos;ve never actually done--
sidebar . what do you find more fulfilling--
liposuction or body sculpting ?
sidebar . isn &apos;t it true you &apos;ve completed
more successful skin grafts
than any other doctor in this hospital ?
um ... yeah . what are you doing ?
saving your ass . you hit a rock and you &apos;re sinking .
iceberg ahead , captain .
larry .
you know , we &apos;ve got a free station right over here
if you want to try your hand at some actual surgery .
please .
oh , excuse me one moment .
have a seat , please .
what &apos;s up ? i &apos;m kind of in the middle of something .
i know and i swear i wouldn &apos;t call
unless it were an emergency .
look , i did a ride along today ,
and we got this call--
a kid , about 10 years old , hit and run .
damn it . he &apos;s still locked down .
we can &apos;t intubate .
can you ventilate him ?
barely . his sats are still in the gutter .
okay , let &apos;s get him backboarded .
we need to load and go .
seattle pres is slammed ,
so they &apos;re diverting us to redmond ,
but that &apos;s an hour away , and this kid ...
he doesn &apos;t have an hour , jackson . he doesn &apos;t .
all right . all right . how are his vitals ?
bad . we &apos;ve got no airway .
i can &apos;t crike .
he &apos;s got sub @-@ q emphysema .
he will die en route if we have to go way out there .
he will die .
are you asking what i think you &apos;re asking ?
if i am , will you do it ?
and a few years ago ,
we renovated the waiting room to provide--
chief , a moment , please .
give me a moment .
kepner &apos;s calling with a hit @-@ and @-@ run kid .
he &apos;s in bad shape .
wait . kepner &apos;s in the field ?
they diverted her to redmond . okay ? we &apos;re closer . much closer .
so i can arrange--
absolutely not .
we are not a trauma center anymore .
if we take them in , and something happens to them--
chief , it &apos;s a kid .
protocol dictates the patient goes
to the nearest trauma center , and that &apos;s not us .
i &apos;m sorry .
you need to get back to the seminar .
and you have to step it up .
what do you need , a pep talk , tough love ?
no amount of tough love is gonna make up for the babies ...
alex saves on a daily basis .
can i trust you ?
why do i have to be the patient ?
&apos;cause you look the part .
oh , and i &apos;m naturally vivacious .
yeah , &quot; manic &quot; &apos; s more a word for it .
i &apos;m so sorry for the wait .
we &apos;re gonna get a doctor to you just as soon as possible .
well , it really wasn &apos;t a wait .
ew . wow . you &apos;re a happy one , aren &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s up there , too .
hello , i &apos;m dr. mattoo . you can call me kan if you &apos;d like .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if you weren &apos;t experiencing
some pain or discomfort .
i apologize if we exacerbated that with a wait .
uh , we got here , like , half a minute ago .
it &apos;s ...
okay , mr. plantain .
uh , it &apos;s like the fruit .
it &apos;s cuban .
can you spell that for me ?
um , p @-@ l @-@ a @-@ n ...
uh , t @-@ a @-@ i @-@ n .
well , mr. plantain , we know you have
a lot of options for your health care management ,
and we are honored that you &apos;ve chosen us today .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
saw your e.k.g. it looks pretty good .
how are you feeling today ?
uh , well , uh , dr. kan ,
uh , you know , the last 24 hours , i @-@ i &apos;ve--
uh , uh , sorry . let me-- let me put that another way .
what brought you in today ?
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s wrong with ...
asking him how he feels ?
that could take us down the wrong road ,
and because your time is valuable to us ,
we don &apos;t want to get off on any tangents .
mm . well , if you ask him how he &apos;s feeling ,
maybe he &apos;ll tell you that he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s blue , &apos; cause ...
yeah .
you know , his company
was just purchased by a bigger company ...
that he doesn &apos;t like .
and , you know , he can &apos;t talk to me about it
&apos;cause ... i &apos;m the self @-@ involved type .
you know , we just , like ,
you know , shop online and redecorate the house .
and so he &apos;s been-- he &apos;s been , uh , hanging out
at the ... local watering hole ,
where he has been bumming cigarettes .
and , uh , now he &apos;s experiencing shortness of breath .
so if you ask him what brought him in today ,
he &apos;s just gonna tell you &quot; shortness of breath . &quot;
and then you &apos;d miss the whole cigarette connection .
i ask about smoking on screen two .
fine . whatever .
okay , let me get back to screen one .
darn it . the screen froze .
sorry . technical difficulties .
uh , i &apos;m gonna have to exit the system ...
and take us back to the top .
uh , it @-@ it @-@ it &apos;s okay . uh , take--take your time .
can &apos;t really do that .
we &apos;ve only got 15 minutes together today .
there we go .
mr. plantain ,
can you spell that for me ?
wow . they really cleared the place out .
okay , where do we start ?
you can start by guarding the door .
hey , no one can know about this .
no one comes in . you understand ?
okay .
medusa me all you want . you &apos;re not getting in .
i &apos;m an attending
and i &apos;m ordering you to let me in .
well , you &apos;re not my attending today , so--
don &apos;t make me force you .
i &apos;d like to see you try .
jo . it &apos;s okay .
i paged her . she &apos;s cool .
i hope you understand .
i would never ordinarily speak to you that way
and i look forward to working on your service again soon .
how can i help ?
you &apos;re barely 18 .
you know , what if you wake up ,
you realize this was all a mistake ?
this isn &apos;t a haircut or some meaningless tattoo .
this is my life .
this is me .
all right . you feel different .
you want to belong . okay .
i get that , but you have your whole life ahead--
i mean , what--what-- what &apos;s the rush ?
i &apos;m just asking for you to wait .
brian feels like he &apos;s dying inside .
we both do .
if you just listen ,
brian will tell you that
living inside of a body like this--
i &apos;m sorry .
could you just ... give us a moment alone ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t want her to go .
and i don &apos;t want you mutilating yourself !
i &apos;m not !
brian &apos;s just trying to be--
oh , for god sake . her name is brianna !
dad , just get out .
go .
just get out !
you heard him .
i just snagged a monitor ,
a ventilator , and central line kits .
i have saline , infusion pumps ,
a crash cart , and cristina .
i &apos;m sorry . they overpowered me .
the fewer people who know about this , the better guys .
i brought lackeys .
what ? no , i don &apos;t need interns .
no , this room has three internal exits .
you have a lookout on one .
happy , ponytail , you man the doors .
mousy , um , be the nurse . we need gloves .
on it .
why do i have to be the nurse ?
we are gonna need lights .
no , if i turn on more overheads ...
you can see it from the hallway .
we can use those .
hello . yep . okay .
all right . they &apos;re pulling up now .
let &apos;s go .
oh , jeez .
i &apos;m okay .
that &apos;s why we needed interns .
the door won &apos;t open ?
watch the i.v.s.
hurry .
april , what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know . jackson ? jackson !
pull . it &apos;s starting to give .
more ! more !
go sit down , mer .
oh , come on . just because my uterus is occupied--
go sit down . i &apos;m not kidding . give me your spot .
what--
don &apos;t worry .
i ditched my p.r. chick before i got down here .
how did you know that we--
i paged him .
you &apos;ve got an incoming kid .
you &apos;re gonna need kid @-@ sized equipment .
i brought a peds cart with a bunch of crap .
all right . are we doing this ?
all right , guys , on my count .
one , two , three !
go , go , go , go . go . come on , guys .
we need to do rapid sequence intubation , stat !
we could only get a 20- and a 22 @-@ gauge in the field .
i &apos;ll start a central line . i need some lactated ringers .
on it .
i got it . i can see the cords .
paralytics are working .
all right , uh , i @-@ i need an e.t. tube .
orange drawer . orange drawer .
i knew that .
no chest sounds on the right . i have to throw in a chest tube .
uh , i think i saw betadine somewhere .
wait a second . does anybody actually have chest tubes ?
i &apos;m trying to set up this saline drip ,
and i can &apos;t get this thing to stop beeping .
anyone ?
i can give it a shot .
all right , i &apos;m not finding chest tubes now ,
but i got n.g. tubes . did anybody actually bring suction ?
uh , there &apos;s a portable suction in the rig .
okay .
i &apos;ll go get it .
thank you .
incoming !
lights .
all clear .
i &apos;m in . brooks , bag him .
so dr. avery is taking a power nap .
he likes to rest up before big surgeries .
and dr. karev had a dentist appointment .
even doctors have to go to the doctor .
meanwhile , have you seen the skin lab
where dr. avery grows actual skin ?
come on .
okay , i &apos;m back . i got it .
help me secure this n.g. tube .
all right , hook it up so we can suction .
okay , who &apos;s got the portable ultrasound ?
we don &apos;t have one ?
happy ?
on it .
wilson , get in here . we need some more hands .
if this kid dies because you brought red along
on same lame idea of a date ...
the ride along was a date ?
i need some 4x4s to control the bleeding on the scalp .
all three lines are patent .
we can start dopamine at 5 mics per kilo per minute ,
but we need to figure out his i.v. drip rate .
it &apos;s different for kids , depending on size .
um , anybody have a calculator ?
i always ask a nurse .
not a real nurse .
broselow tape says he &apos;s 30 kilos .
standard concentration of dopamine is 1,600 mics per cc .
so 5 times 30 is 150 .
times 60 minutes in an hour is 9,000 .
divide that by 1,600 .
infusion rate is 5.625 cc &apos;s per hour .
what ? i &apos;m really good at math .
okay , let &apos;s , uh , give him 5.6--
except we don &apos;t have any dopamine , guys .
we don &apos;t have access to any non @-@ code medications at all ,
unless we have a nurse or a code--
yes , you do .
you paged him , too ?
well , i knew we were gonna need meds .
i have the codes . tell me what the patient needs .
&quot; don &apos;t smoke &quot; ? that was his big advice ?
uh , yeah , he examined me and found nothing wrong ,
which in fact , is the case .
oh , he was an idiot .
and now i feel like an idiot .
we &apos;re just wandering around .
we look like interlopers .
hey , you know , let &apos;s grab a cup of coffee .
you always look like you belong when you &apos;re carrying a coffee .
no , walk with purpose . don &apos;t look shifty .
i don &apos;t .
okay . oh , look .
okay .
want to make sure we &apos;re on the same page .
that makes sense .
i think one more diagnostic--
do we have time for that ?
just one ? i think we &apos;re pretty good .
all right .
15 minutes a patient ?
can a doctor learn anything in that little time ?
you get really efficient .
and patient outcomes don &apos;t suffer ?
wow . you &apos;re that efficient ?
are you visiting a patient ?
hmm ? oh , uh , i &apos;m richard webber .
this is my colleague , uh , callie torres .
um , we &apos;re with pegasus ,
and we just wanted to check in , get a little feedback .
see if you had any concerns .
really ?
really .
okay , you need propofol ... gentamicin and , uh ...
you will be really impressed by our next stop downstairs ...
downstairs , which will be the site for our new hernia clinic .
get down there now .
okay .
alana .
is this the group from pegasus you mentioned ?
hi , i &apos;m dr. shepherd . good to see you .
hi , very nice to meet you . how &apos;s the tour going ?
good ?
we like what we &apos;re seeing so far .
oh , i &apos;m glad to hear that .
you know this is more than just a hospital
for a lot of us .
and i don &apos;t want to sound cheesy , but it &apos;s , uh ,
it &apos;s like family .
it &apos;s like home .
hey , have you ever seen a human brain up close ?
i can &apos;t say that i have .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna give you the unofficial tour
by way of the third @-@ floor coffee cart .
we &apos;ll have some coffee first . you &apos;re gonna love it .
i &apos;ve got free fluid in the left upper quadrant .
crap . what time is it ?
we have surgery on brian in 20 minutes .
cahill will definitely notice
if we don &apos;t show .
if you guys need to go , go . we can handle this .
look , i &apos;m seeing a pneumopericardium .
okay , we should put in another chest tube on the left ,
just to be sure .
well , this kid needs an o.r.
guys , we &apos;ve gotta move him .
we can &apos;t . not till we have someplace for him to go .
there &apos;s no time . cahill &apos;s on her way down here right now .
okay . we &apos;re staying .
are you hungry ? can i buy you lunch ?
actually , we have a very tight schedule .
we need to get down to the hernia clinic now .
you know what ? why don &apos;t i join you ?
we gotta move the rig . it &apos;s still parked outside .
it &apos;s okay . go . move , guys . move !
hurry !
we gotta get this thing mobile .
what happened ?
he &apos;s bradying down .
we gotta keep moving .
i &apos;m not getting a pulse !
ross , start c.p.r.
damn it . his trachea is deviated to the left .
his sats are dropping .
i think he has a tension pneumo .
he has bilateral chest tubes .
it must have gotten blocked .
someone find me a 14 @-@ gauge cannula or a 16 @-@ gauge .
whatever you can find , the biggest .
um , got it !
guys , what about cahill ?
oh , god . what-- what if he dies ?
what if we brought him here and what if he dies ?
hernias are one of
the most common general surgery procedures .
and as it turns out , also one of the most lucrative .
why did i agree to this ?
guys , we gotta keep moving .
i can &apos;t even think !
we have to move !
cahill &apos;s coming down right now . if we don &apos;t move--
we &apos;re moving . yang .
wait one second . one second .
now keep in mind , the site is still under construction ,
but you &apos;ll just have to use a little imagination .
before we go in there , i &apos;d like to , uh ...
okay , right this way .
and , uh , watch your step please .
last month , i had to do a cardiac cath on a patient
with no signs of heart disease .
it &apos;s putting the patient at risk for no reason .
forget physician advocacy . it doesn &apos;t exist .
we have no say in anything ... at all .
yeah , and if you decide to go crazy ,
and think for yourself ,
they know , like , instantly .
i swear the walls have ears .
are you the reps from pegasus ?
uh , dr. webber and dr. torres .
hi .
callie torres ... from seattle grace ?
uh , i &apos;m--do i-- do i know you ?
no . kenton giles .
i &apos;m an ortho just like you .
yeah , i read all about your cartilage generation work .
it &apos;s incredible .
i didn &apos;t realize you stopped practicing .
so you work for pegasus now ?
yeah .
yeah , i guess i ...
needed a ... i needed to mix it up a little , so ...
she peaked , you know , with the cartilage generation .
uh , you know , sometimes it &apos;s best
to get out before you decline . yeah .
and after the anesthesia is administered ,
brian will be ready for surgery .
and when exactly are we gonna see doctors avery and karev again ?
no offense ,
but we &apos;re here to trail them , not you .
edwards , nice work .
ah . no problem .
we &apos;re ready to scrub in .
wilson , could you show our friends up to the gallery ?
you guys can watch from up there .
you have a little bit of blood on your left shoulder .
everyone , right this way .
here we go .
by streamlining the process ,
we will significantly decrease the hospital &apos;s hernia complication rate ...
and become a destination medical center .
how many patients will this place accommodate at a time ?
upwards of 30 ...
once everything is ... finished .
shepherd ,
uh , would you mind taking over ?
uh , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
right . uh , yes .
i was gonna try a similar research project ,
but now that i &apos;m the face of portland gen ,
i don &apos;t have that kind of time .
really ?
yeah . i do a lot of press .
about orthopedic surgery ? that &apos;s great .
well , more like , you know , wellness , nutrition ,
get eight hours sleep , take a walk .
uh , sometimes i do a photo op in the o.r.
they don &apos;t want to shoot a real person ,
so they have me cutting a chicken breast or something .
well , i work on the portland trailblazers , though .
real guys , not chickens .
yeah , that &apos;s--that &apos;s good .
nothing innovative like dr. torres does .
or ... did , i guess i should say .
y @-@ you know what ? uh ...
i was wondering ,
can this stay between us , not get back to pegasus ?
nothing you say to us will ever get back to pegasus .
great .
well , now that you &apos;re not practicing ...
is there an ortho opening at seattle grace ?
well , i hope you get it , the brand ambassador thing .
i don &apos;t want to be the face of any hospital
where i have to sneak around and risk my job
just to do the right thing .
screw that . i hope you get it .
all right , well , this keyhole incision is done .
we &apos;re ready to begin closing .
who are you operating on , dr. avery ?
my transgender patient , why ?
what did you do ?
this part of the lung is fried .
i &apos;m gonna have to do a resection .
the spleen is out .
let &apos;s irrigate with antibiotic solution .
does somebody want to tell me
where the hell this patient came from ?
whose patient is this ?
fine . you don &apos;t have to tell us .
we can just look it up .
all i need is the patient &apos;s name .
wait . no , um--
i can do it . i &apos;ll look it up . it &apos;s my patient . you got this ?
thank you , dr. grey .
appreciate your cooperation .
sure . no problem .
i &apos;m happy to . okay .
i just have to get into the patient file .
oh , no .
what ?
this keeps happening to me .
i try to go into the patient file
and i guess i deleted it .
what happened ?
cahill figured it out ?
they &apos;re taking us in one at a time
to see who &apos;ll break first .
i can &apos;t lie . i &apos;m no good at it .
they &apos;ll see right through me .
stay strong , dopey .
you can do it .
they started with the interns .
i &apos;m just trying to find out what happened .
you want to know what happened ? i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
a kid was dying , and we kept him alive .
dr. karev , hello .
you mentioned the word &quot; we . &quot;
who else was involved ?
i was .
this was my call .
i took the kid in . i decided to treat him .
we did the right thing .
we saved his life .
and that &apos;s what matters .
not these idiotic new policies
or some stupid ad campaign .
so you can punish us however you want .
we don &apos;t care because--
that &apos;s enough .
just ... go .
oh , that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re not going to discipline them or ...
go .
you paged me ?
no .
yes .
we have a problem .
my presence seems to have ignited an uprising ,
which makes it a little tough for me to do my job ,
especially when you help them .
what ?
it was your code that accessed
the medication case on floor five .
is that true ?
that stuff you said , dr. shepherd ,
about how this hospital is such a family ?
it was lovely , really .
i even think you meant it .
but it means nothing if there is no hospital .
do you know how much this stunt
would &apos;ve cost this place
if that kid had died on our watch ?
pegasus would &apos;ve backed out .
and without them , you &apos;re done .
i am trying to help you .
but i can &apos;t do that
if you are undermining me at every turn .
if you care anything about this hospital
or the people in it ,
then it &apos;s time that you get on board .
otherwise the next doors to close will be yours .
jess , the surgery went very well .
brian should be in recovery soon .
you &apos;ll be able to visit him then .
mr. weston ?
is that you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just want to hear
how bri-- how everything went .
i sent you the e @-@ mail last night .
not brian . it was me .
he wasn &apos;t gonna tell you .
i know you guys don &apos;t talk that much
since he moved out ,
but ... he talks about you .
a lot .
he admires you .
i think he wants to grow up and be you .
and you &apos;re his dad .
it was a major surgery . i thought you should know .
i get why you blame me for this .
he met me
and started changing ...
dressing differently
and acting differently .
but ...
i &apos;m not ...
it &apos;s hard ...
being like us ...
trying to fit into this--
this mold that
doesn &apos;t fit .
he just wants you to love him , mr. weston ...
the way he loves you .
he didn &apos;t tell you
because he didn &apos;t want to mess that up .
you guys okay on rent ?
here .
that &apos;s all i have on me .
you don &apos;t want to be there when he wakes up ?
change is a funny thing .
not everyone can handle it .
so i know you keep saying
that you and wilson aren &apos;t a thing .
&apos;cause we &apos;re not .
well , maybe you should be .
she kinda kicked ass today .
just saying .
come on .
come on where .
just come on .
it can sneak up on you .
it &apos;s funny how you don &apos;t appreciate a thing
until you &apos;re about to lose it .
no .
no , don &apos;t-- don &apos;t say that .
that &apos;s ...
we can still fight this .
you can fight this .
me ?
i &apos;ve got an early retirement package waiting .
maybe i &apos;ll take it .
good night , torres .
good night .
things aren &apos;t what they used to be .
matthew ?
i was hoping to catch you .
uh , how &apos;s the , uh , kid ?
he is doing great .
he made it through surgery with flying colors .
oh , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s good .
uh , april , i , um ,
oh , man .
i had this whole thing
that i @-@ i wanted to say to you ,
and then you look at me , and i just ...
okay . pull it together .
you are the strongest , most fearless ,
beautiful woman i &apos;ve ever met .
you were incredible today .
you are incredible .
and , uh ...
i like you .
i @-@ i really like you .
and i ...
just thought i should say that
so you knew , because i--
your whole world has transformed .
what are we doing in here ?
just wait .
i stole them from the nurses in derm .
they won &apos;t eat &apos; em anyway .
they &apos;re all &quot; no sugar &quot; and &quot; gluten @-@ free . &quot;
cheers to an incredible day .
you deserve it .
actually , i helped , too . so cheers to us .
hey , powdered sugar &apos;s your favorite .
yeah , no . this is great . thanks .
what ?
nothing .
you realize ...
the ground beneath you has shifted .
you guys are killing me .
it was the right thing to do .
you &apos;re still killing me .
things are uncertain .
and there &apos;s no turning back .
she &apos;s not answering .
i really want to wait for cristina .
okay , fine . fine . let &apos;s wait for cristina .
let &apos;s just wait downstairs where it &apos;s warm .
no , we can &apos;t . the walls have ears .
i &apos;m outta here .
okay , all right .
uh , look , i called this meeting
because we can &apos;t just keep our heads down and lay low .
okay , we &apos;re the reason the hospital &apos;s in trouble .
we have to do something .
we can &apos;t let pegasus take over .
we have a responsibility .
which is why i think
we should buy the hospital ourselves .
the world around you is different now ...
unrecognizable ...
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
you &apos;re stuck .
the future &apos;s staring you in the face .
and you &apos;re not sure you like what you see .
like i said ,
