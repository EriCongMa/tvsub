come on !
it &apos;s over there .
help ! help me .
help me , please .
help me .
please help me .
not bad for your first time .
i could &apos;ve kept going .
first rule of spearfishing is :
you kill what you eat , you eat what you kill .
well , guess what &apos;s for lunch today .
you know , your dad took me fishing a couple of times .
he and some of the vets would rent a boat for the day .
where , in kailua bay ?
yeah .
oh , man , when i was a kid ,
i always wanted him to take me .
it was back when i was a rookie ,
very eager to impress .
took me five minutes to realize
it was less about the fishing , more about the drinking .
yeah , that was my dad .
i &apos;ll tell you , though ,
he had some great stories .
i want to show you something .
one of the last things
my father said to me before he was killed--
it didn &apos;t make sense at the time--
but he called me &quot; champ . &quot;
my entire life , he &apos;s never once called me that .
it &apos;s got to be a clue-- he wanted you to find it .
all this stuff was inside .
the postcards are from osaka , japan .
i got two names off them , both former yakuza lieutenants ,
now deceased .
they &apos;re photos of a car .
looks like the result of a car bomb .
i got an unmarked key .
looks like a furniture key .
right . and i &apos;ve tried every single lock in this entire house .
i even tracked down my dad &apos;s old desk from the hpd ,
nothing fits .
this number right here , i &apos;ve been trying
to match this number to bank accounts
passports , social security numbers .
nothing , nothing comes up .
look , you were his partner when he retired , chin .
does any of this make sense to you ?
i think this is a case number .
no , i considered that .
it doesn &apos;t match hpd &apos;s filing format .
no , no , no . back when everything was logged manually ,
they used this format for police reports .
now it &apos;s all done electronically .
well , if this is a case file ,
can you get your hands on it ?
well , i know someone back at the archives .
he &apos;s probably the only guy on the force that &apos;ll take my call ,
but ... yeah , i &apos;ll reach out .
thanks .
that &apos;s us .
all right , if you could escort them out , it &apos;d be great .
shoots .
so , vic &apos;s name is erica harris .
she &apos;s 26 , and she &apos;s here on her honeymoon .
they found her in kahana state park
wearing nothing but a nightie .
totally disoriented .
she was suffering from dehydration and exposure .
any signs of assault ?
no sexual trauma , but she does have
some minor injuries , including defensive bruising .
looks like a possible abduction case .
possible abduction ? either you &apos;re abducted or you &apos;re not .
the thing is , she doesn &apos;t actually remember being taken .
hpd tried to get a statement from her ,
but she doesn &apos;t even know how she ended up
in the middle of the forest 20 miles away from her hotel .
have we ruled out the obvious , like psychiatric disorders ,
sleepwalking , i don &apos;t know , a hard night of partying ?
yeah , thank you very much .
yeah , i have definitely heard wilder drinking stories
than ending up half naked in the forest ,
but her blood alcohol is normal .
yeah , we &apos;re still waiting on her tox panel .
medical history &apos;s clean , though .
what about the husband , he see anything ?
his name is jake harris , and he &apos;s nowhere to be found .
which means he might be a suspect .
or a victim .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
i mean ...
why would somebody do this to us ?
why would they take jake ?
look , i know this is hard , but , um ...
i need you to try to tell us what happened last night .
after dinner , we , um ...
we went for a long walk along the beach .
we got back to our hotel room around 10 : 30 ...
went to sleep .
i woke up .
it was dark and cold .
you were in the forest ?
no , it was inside a room .
inside a room but not your hotel room .
was anybody in the room with you ?
i &apos;m not sure .
it was really dark .
it &apos;s okay .
you said your hands and feet were tied .
how did you free yourself ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was all really foggy .
i just remember ...
running through the woods ,
and i kept thinking ...
&quot; don &apos;t stop .
&quot; just keep going . &quot;
so that &apos;s what i did .
what happened after that ?
that &apos;s all i remember .
okay , um , listen , we &apos;re gonna let you rest .
okay ? i know this has been really hard for you , so just try to relax .
come on .
okay , why &apos;d you cut that short ?
because i have interviewed enough victims to know
when to back off .
danny , she &apos;s not just a victim ,
she &apos;s a witness , and the information we get from her
could help find her husband .
she can &apos;t tell us something she doesn &apos;t know .
all right ? it &apos;s called trauma @-@ induced amnesia .
okay ? a person &apos;s in shock , they suppress memories .
tell me where my son is .
erica &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law ,
nancy harris , just flew in from san francisco .
i want to know what happened to my son .
mam , you need to calm down .
just where is he ?
ms. harris ,
i &apos;m lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett with five @-@ o.
my unit is handling this case .
okay , we are putting all of our resources into finding your son .
i &apos;d like to talk to my daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
erica &apos;s fine , okay ? she &apos;s being treated for her injuries right now .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
erica is no victim .
if something happened to my son , she &apos;s responsible .
jake and erica met six months ago ,
and three weeks later , they were engaged .
so you don &apos;t believe in love at first sight ?
well , jake has never been the impulsive type ,
so it concerned me to see him act so recklessly .
nevertheless , i decided to give them my blessing ,
provided they sign a prenuptial agreement .
so jake had some money ?
jake is a managing partner
at harris , axelrod and price .
it &apos;s the law firm that my late husband founded .
so i guess they didn &apos;t sign the prenup , huh ?
no . no , and after i suggested it ,
he stopped returning my phone calls ,
i couldn &apos;t reach him at the office ,
and then ... i found out that
they ran off to hawaii .
it was erica .
i am sure of it .
she targeted my son for his money .
she rushed him into marriage , she manipulated him .
jake has a vast fortune .
all she has is a spotty past and a lot of debt .
how do you know that ?
&apos;cause i did my homework .
now , i trust that you will do yours .
please ...
find my son .
mother @-@ in @-@ laws .
i take it you didn &apos;t have a good relationship with yours .
no , not really . she lives in manchester .
she came to visit once--
it was the longest and worst 48 hours of my life .
wait a minute , your mother @-@ in @-@ law came
all the way from england and stayed for two days ?
no , no , i checked her into the holiday inn after two days .
it was me or her , babe .
guys , what do we know ?
we ran background on our newlyweds .
erica harris , born erica wells ,
jacksonviille , 1984 .
since then , she bounced around the country taking dead @-@ end jobs
and amassing over a hundred grand in debt .
six months ago she lands in san francisco and
lands temp work at a law firm where she meets her husband ,
jacob harris .
wow , look at that guy .
she obviously married him for his looks .
love is blind .
it &apos;s not that blind .
okay , so evidently ,
you , danny , are down with the , uh , mother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s
gold digger theory .
she gets a temp job at a law firm ,
and six months later she is married to the senior partner ,
so yes .
it could be she targeted him .
okay , so the debt gives her financial motive
and might be why she wants to get rid of her husband ,
but stage her own abduction ?
so she looks like a victim instead of a suspect .
and it keeps us busy looking for someone who doesn &apos;t exist .
hotel security reported no signs
of forced entry at the honeymoon suite ,
and the room wasn &apos;t accessed by key card .
okay , so we got two people that get grabbed
from their hotel room in the middle of the night ,
and we have no idea how the abductor got in or out .
we know that the couple &apos;s rental car was taken
from the south parking structure at 2 : 30 a.m.
i also pulled the call log from the hotel room phone .
nothing out of the ordinary there .
but ... the night they were abducted ,
there were five calls
placed from erica &apos;s cell phone to the same local number .
pagoda hotel , waikiki .
all right , so if she did clip her husband ,
maybe she had an accomplice .
i don &apos;t know anything about a pagoda hotel .
i certainly didn &apos;t make any calls to it .
okay , so how do you explain the five calls
from your cell phone to the front desk there yesterday ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe jake borrowed my phone .
he forget to bring his cell charger .
yeah , from what we hear , you had to pack in a hurry .
you spoke to jake &apos;s mother .
look , i know what she thinks of me ,
but i didn &apos;t marry jake for his money .
is it true that you wouldn &apos;t sign a prenuptial agreement ?
no .
no . i was willing to sign the prenup .
jake was the one who refused .
he didn &apos;t want to give his mother the victory .
that &apos;s why we came here .
to get away from her .
the woman is toxic .
wait . you think that i would do something to hurt jake ?
we &apos;re not saying that , okay ?
but you need to understand
you &apos;re our only witness in this investigation .
yeah , and unfortunately ,
that does make you a person of interest .
we just got married .
this is our honeymoon .
now jake is missing .
i @-@ i can &apos;t even go back to our hotel room
because it &apos;s a crime scene .
listen , why don &apos;t you let us set you up in a hotel room
with an hpd detail ?
why ? so you can keep an eye on me ?
this room alone is bigger than my whole apartment .
the trunk of my car is bigger than your apartment .
oh , thanks for reminding me .
so this is what $ 5,500 a night buys .
you know , i &apos;m probably biased &apos; cause i &apos;m local ,
but i can &apos;t imagine a honeymoon spot less exotic
than a waikiki hotel
with a ukulele band in the lobby .
why ? where do you want to go when you get married ?
cleveland ?
haaaaaa .
if i get married ,
it &apos;ll probably be somewhere with cobblestone .
like prague or brussels .
ooh . fancy .
malia and i were gonna go to lanai .
that &apos;s the furthest i could take her on a cop &apos;s salary .
yeah . she didn &apos;t even deserve that .
hey . easy to judge from a distance .
it wasn &apos;t so simple .
sorry . it &apos;s just ...
if you want to forgive her for abandoning you
when you needed her most , that &apos;s fine .
but i sure as hell don &apos;t have to .
hey , cuz .
you smell that ?
what ?
oh . smells like nail polish remover .
lots of it .
connecting suite next door .
what , you think that could have been the point of entry ?
yeah . there was this case a few years back .
a burglar pumped acetone gas
into a high @-@ rise condo before he robbed the place .
acetone , like in nail polish remover .
yeah , exactly . but in gas form ,
it actually incapacitates the victims .
so they won &apos;t wake up during the robbery .
that &apos;s disturbingly well thought @-@ out .
it might also explain
why erica has no memory of the abduction .
hold on .
what are you doing ?
just large enough to feed a gas line through .
we need to get into that room .
i spoke to the manager .
all the calls from erica &apos;s cell ?
room 106 , right here .
did you get a name ?
no . the guy paid cash up front .
he &apos;s been here a week .
hello ?
hello ? anyone home ?
nobody &apos;s home . all right .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m trying to open it . that &apos;s what doors do .
first of all , you cannot open doors without consent .
is that clear ?
and second ?
second , it &apos;s probably locked .
yes . it &apos;s locked .
but i may have heard a distant cry for help .
&quot; please help me , &quot; coming through this door .
therefore giving us probable cause to enter the premises .
and we would be remiss not to render assistance to that call .
right ?
i agree , yes .
whoa ! whoa ! what the hell are you doing ?
probable cause . i thought we were just doing a thing .
a thing ... i meant that we &apos;d get a key from the manager ,
you neanderthal animal .
okay . just go .
come check this out .
i cannot wait
to tell these people that you
and the state of hawaii owe them a new door .
erica and jake harris .
they &apos;re in all of these .
looks like they picked up a stalker on their honeymoon .
yeah .
gun ! gun ! oh ! oh !
whoa , whoa , whoa ! five @-@ o !
you move , i &apos;m gonna kill you . okay ?
yeah .
kurt miller . berkeley , california .
what are you people doing in my room ?
we &apos;re investigating a case . what are you doing ?
he &apos;s got a p.i. license .
i &apos;m investigating a case , too .
this looks like our source of the acetone .
chin !
you find something ?
yeah . jake harris .
medical examiner says jake &apos;s been dead for 12 hours .
that puts the murder at about 2 : 00 a.m.
fits erica &apos;s timeline .
yeah , but that &apos;s not the only thing .
someone fed gas into their room from an adjoining suite .
my guess is that it &apos;s acetone ,
which explains erica &apos;s memory gap
and how she just woke up in the woods .
did you get an id on whoever rented the adjoining suite ?
no . it wasn &apos;t booked for last night .
suspect gained access using a stolen maintenance key .
you get anything on your end ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
look , i know how this must look .
i &apos;m a former cop , myself .
there &apos;s an abduction . there &apos;s one person missing .
you find me here with some incriminating photos .
some incriminating photos ?
huh ? pay attention .
magnum . all right ?
you &apos;re like stalkerazzi .
there &apos;s 200 photos of the same couple .
i &apos;m not saying anything else without my counsel here .
so book me if you have to .
do not say it .
thank you .
we book you , it &apos;s going to be for murder one .
what are you talking about ?
jake harris is dead .
they found his body at the akahai .
his father &apos;s an old friend .
i &apos;ve been working at the firm for over 20 years
as an in @-@ house investigator .
jake was like family .
nancy asked me to help .
nancy harris ? jake &apos;s mother ?
after they got engaged ,
she had me run a background check on erica .
then the kids took off , and she sent me to find them .
how long were you tailing them ?
i got here after the wedding .
followed them for about a week ,
until two days ago .
why did you stop ?
i got made .
jake spotted me and demanded i back off , so i did .
oh , maybe if i &apos;d been there , i could have stopped it .
okay , uh ...
let me ask you a question , okay ?
you ran background on erica .
you saw how she was with jake .
was she playing him ?
i &apos;ll tell you like i told nancy .
i &apos;ve seen a lot of gold diggers in my time ,
but erica was not one of them .
the way she loved jake--
there &apos;s no faking that .
i got this one .
thank you .
my first week out of the academy ,
we get a call .
drive @-@ by shooting .
and um , an eight @-@ year @-@ old kid gets shot in the crossfire .
and it is my job to go tell this kid &apos;s mother
that she has lost her son .
i remember that moment . it was brutal .
i remember sitting there , thinking ,
&quot; this has got to get easier . &quot; you know ?
yeah . but it doesn &apos;t .
i was 16 .
my mom was late for dinner .
mom was never late .
and , uh , the doorbell rang , and from the minute
i saw that cop &apos;s face , i knew right away .
how did it happen ?
it was a car accident .
drunk driver .
you know , my dad used to say he felt sorry for the cop
who had to come and tell us .
and i never understood what he meant by that ,
until the day came that i had to do it myself .
i guess the day you get used to it
is the day you hang it up , right ?
radio ?
yeah .
are you serious ?
what ?
you &apos;re not gonna do something ? you &apos;re not gonna change this ?
what &apos;s wrong with this ?
you &apos;re gonna leave this ?
you &apos;re not gonna do something about this ?
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay ? !
all right . okay .
i know that you have been trained to endure torture .
okay ? but this is unbearable , okay ?
this is ... this is ... this is not right .
okay ? songs this bad make even stable people want
to kill other people . you understand ?
i think it &apos;s kind of catchy .
you ...
sounds like he &apos;s torturing a walrus .
max ?
max !
uh , yes , oh , hi .
uh , uh , th @-@ the room gets extremely cold ,
which causes the soundboard to expand and contract ,
which causes the pitch to be off @-@ key .
i had a piano tuner , but he liked to ... chat .
it was emotionally draining .
max , do you have the autopsy results on jake harris ?
i do .
c.o.d. was asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation .
no defensive wounds ,
no apparent signs that the victim tried to resist .
there was a canister of acetone gas at the scene .
we think he was sedated .
yes , that would be consistent with the tox panel .
mr. harris had elevated levels of ketone in his blood .
i &apos;m guessing we &apos;ll find the same thing
when we get back erica &apos;s tests from the hospital .
the wife was assaulted as well ?
yeah , she was abducted from the hotel .
was she taken to a remote area ?
yeah .
and let me guess-- they were newlyweds here on honeymoon ?
okay , how are you putting this all together ?
well , in my spare time
i contribute to an online community
devoted to unsolved homicides .
so you work with dead bodies all day ,
and your hobby is dead bodies ?
i also make pickles .
it &apos;s a good way to reuse specimen jars .
there we go .
about a year ago there was a series of homicides
in french polynesia .
so you think they &apos;re connected to the harris case ?
similar m.o.
all victims were newlywed couples ,
all were dosed with tranquilizing agents prior to the attack ,
and in every case the men were asphyxiated on site .
what about the women ?
well , the killer took more time with them .
they were always found 24 to 48 hours later ,
mutilated .
their bodies were discarded in isolated areas .
this is our guy .
we have a serial killer .
we got three couples murdered over the course of seven days .
one in bora @-@ bora , one in huahine ,
the other in moorea .
all of them were newlyweds .
the newlywed killer .
someone should just tell this guy
that if people stay married long enough ,
they just kill each other .
it gets weirder . check this out .
so here &apos;s erica harris .
now , here are his previous three female victims--
all from the mainland , dark hair , blue eyes .
at least we know he has a type .
this may help us find his next victim .
and there definitely will be a next victim .
last time this guy dropped three bodies .
all right , this guy &apos;s pretty clever , right ?
he commits a crime ,
and before the bodies are found , he &apos;s off to another island .
which means he may not be on oahu anymore .
mcgarrett .
i &apos;ll put out an alert
to all the statewide law enforcement agencies
and send over what we have so far .
okay .
that was hpd .
they found the harris rental car .
nothing in the trunk .
the rearview is tilted up , the seat &apos;s pushed way back .
i &apos;m thinking our guy is tall--
probably about six feet .
right , well , if erica was unconscious ,
he couldn &apos;t have taken her very far .
she said she came to in a dark room ,
didn &apos;t know where she was .
we should check all nearby storage facilities and outposts .
i need all of your men .
we &apos;re gonna start here , we &apos;re gonna canvass outwards .
guys , guys ,
our suspect could still be here , so look sharp .
okay , let &apos;s go .
these the photos we got off the p.i. ?
yeah , he was trailing the harrises for over a week ,
snapping photos , so i got to thinking
that maybe he wasn &apos;t the only one following them .
well , serial killers tend to stalk their victims beforehand .
so i ran the photos through the facial recognition software .
i didn &apos;t get any hits on the national database ,
so ... i started going through the photos manually .
you ever play where &apos;s waldo ?
look at that .
he &apos;s in three different photographs ,
each one taken at a different time in a different location .
what are the odds that that &apos;s a coincidence ?
that &apos;s not a coincidence .
i think you just found our serial killer .
hey , yo , over here .
this door , huh ?
this is where he could have been holding our victim .
okay , one , two , three , go .
good ?
clear .
see this rope ?
has blood on it .
come check this out .
wow .
very charming fellow .
must have been the popular kid in high school .
i got morphine .
this must be how he sedated her .
i guess he didn &apos;t use a big enough dose .
morphine is a schedule i controlled substance .
right , which means every dose is traceable .
i &apos;ll get kono onto it .
have you tracked that vial of morphine ?
yeah , i got a hit on the rx number .
it looks like this particular vial was released
to the chief medical officer
aboard a pacific discovery cruise ship-- the eternity--
but it was stolen from the ship &apos;s infirmary two days ago .
a cruise ship ?
yeah .
why , what are you thinking ?
the previous murders--
bora @-@ bora , huahine , and moorea--
they &apos;re all popular stops on polynesian cruise lines .
so this guy &apos;s traveling by cruise ship
and he &apos;s stalking his victims on shore when the boats dock .
i &apos;m betting he &apos;s on the eternity right now .
mcgarrett .
so we took another look at those murders from a year ago .
each one of them occurred
when the star of polynesia was docked at port .
that &apos;s a cruise ship that tours those islands .
dates and locations match exactly .
now we know how he got from island to island-- on that boat .
right , and that morphine you found ?
that was just stolen off a local ship called the eternity .
i checked the passenger lists for both cruise ships ,
and there &apos;s one name that appears on both .
bradford matinsky , 36 .
he boarded the eternity four days ago on the big island .
and he matches the photos we got off of that p.i.
this is our guy .
okay , where &apos;s that ship now ?
ten miles off of kauai-- it &apos;s scheduled to dock
in less than an hour , right around sunrise .
we &apos;re working on all our options to keep it at dock .
okay , well , tell them customs is backed up ,
call in a bomb threat .
hell , have cdc quarantine the entire ship
on suspicion of a black plague outbreak .
i don &apos;t care what you do .
okay , nobody disembarks .
got it .
give me those .
put that on .
absolutely not .
listen , we &apos;re going after a dangerous suspect
who may now be aware the police are after him .
we don &apos;t want to spook him ; we want to blend in .
put the lei on .
please don &apos;t make me wear flowers .
danny , we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
i &apos;m gonna do it , okay , but i &apos;m not gonna be happy .
and take the tie off .
no one on a cruise ship wears a tie .
oh , yes , they do , they do all the time
so they can hang themselves when they &apos;re bored .
okay , well , put it in your pocket
and you can kill yourself later .
kalia deck , cabin 226 .
make sure the corridors are clear before we go in .
i &apos;m not going to put any passengers at risk .
keep all these folks back , okay ?
all right .
ready ?
one , two ...
he &apos;s not here .
listen up . you guys have been docked here for over an hour ,
which means our suspect is more than likely
getting a little antsy right now ,
so we need to execute the search as quickly as possible
before he takes things into his own hands .
take a look at the photos
and pass &apos; em along .
his name is bradford matinsky .
he &apos;s six feet tall ,
36 years old .
he &apos;s extremely dangerous
and he &apos;s more than likely armed , so do not try to apprehend him .
okay ? if you spot him , you radio me immediately .
got that ?
okay , move out , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , go .
unfortunately , we are experiencing
mechanical issues with the gangway at this point .
for your safety we ask that you remain onboard
until further notice .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be able to get you folks underway soon .
danny , check that luggage .
we got to find out how this guy picks his victims .
heads up .
what do you got ?
wedding and engagement rings .
matinsky took these off his victims .
these are trophies of his kills .
this guy is beyond disturbed .
okay , i bet he even eats from the buffet line .
wait a minute , danny , check this out .
looks like this guy did his homework .
these are from the akahai &apos;s internal booking system .
it &apos;s a reservation list for every room in the hotel ,
and jake harris &apos; name is circled .
how the hell does he get this stuff ?
he &apos;s got travel itineraries , topography maps ,
wedding announcements .
all the women look alike .
in each of these couples all the women ...
that &apos;s how he does it .
that &apos;s how he does it .
danny , look , they &apos;re all couples .
he finds couples booked into honeymoon suites
and he stalks them online .
finds the ones that fit his m.o.
i mean , we got ... we got at least four couples here .
okay , so how are we going to find out who &apos;s next ?
i don &apos;t know , pick .
commander mcgarrett .
commander mcgarrett , i &apos;ve got eyes on the suspect .
atrium deck , headed down the stairwell .
copy that . do not close on matinsky , okay ?
we &apos;re headed your way .
i &apos;m still on him .
he &apos;s heading towards the staterooms on the ...
danny .
i got him , go ahead .
you all right ?
he went that way .
ma &apos;am , back in your room .
back in your room , close the door .
all right , coast guard &apos;s got divers in the water .
kauai pd has been up and down the shoreline .
there &apos;s no sign of matinsky .
yeah , he &apos;s gone . question is , where did he go ?
all right , he could have gotten on the plane
when erica got away , but he didn &apos;t .
all right , he got back on the boat .
that &apos;s right , &apos; cause he &apos;s not a runner .
his drive to kill overpowers his self @-@ preservation instincts .
he didn &apos;t kill erica , so now he needs a substitute .
all right , listen , i &apos;m looking over his file . check this out .
kristen and elliott clark .
right ? they got married four days ago .
travel itinerary says that they are in kauai now
staying in a honeymoon suite
at a hotel that i cannot pronounce .
the hikina .
that &apos;s not far from here .
all right , chin , you got me and super seal .
go ahead . hey .
so i dug up a little more background info
on our man bradford matinsky .
turns out , he &apos;s a systems analyst
for an engineering firm in lansing , michigan .
well , explains his computer skills .
two years ago , he was engaged to be married to a natalie hayes .
they were planning a big beach wedding in barbados .
let me guess . she had a change of heart . can &apos;t imagine why .
took it pretty hard , though .
he quit his job , he went on unemployment .
and two months later ,
natalie hayes goes missing .
surprise , surprise .
was matinsky ever charged ?
no . he was a person of interest ,
but he was never formally charged with the crime .
case is still unsolved .
all right , so this nut job kills his fiancee ,
and now he &apos;s living out some sort of
sick , sadistic revenge fantasy .
exactly . the dates of the murders coincide
with the anniversary of the wedding ,
almost to the day .
marriage gets called off in december of &apos; 08 .
polynesian murders go down in december of &apos; 09 .
and a year later , here we are .
oh , crap .
i thought i turned it off .
oh , honey , you just completely ruined my zen .
sorry . it &apos;s a private number .
don &apos;t do it .
it could be my parents .
exactly .
hello ?
aloha , mrs. clark .
this is jonathan from guest services .
i &apos;m sorry to disturb you ,
but you have a call at the front desk .
i &apos;m in the middle of a massage .
do you know what it &apos;s about ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t ,
but they said it &apos;s a family emergency .
oh , my god . okay .
i &apos;ll be right there .
there &apos;s a courtesy phone on the second floor
at the end of the hallway .
i can connect you from there .
thanks . i &apos;m on my way .
i wasn &apos;t able to get in touch with the clarks .
all right , we &apos;re still ten minutes out .
we need to find them .
get their security on it .
this can &apos;t be right .
i don &apos;t know . he said the courtesy phone would be here .
i said to look for ...
hey , that &apos;s him right there .
that &apos;s him ?
that &apos;s him .

i &apos;m warning you .

put the guns down !
put your weapon down and let the girl go , please .
i do , and i go to jail .
you don &apos;t , and you die .
so does she !
listen to me , huh ?
we know about your fiancee .
we know she left you on the altar in front of your friends ,
in front of your family .
we know that must have hurt .
you don &apos;t know anything .
i do , all right ? i know what it &apos;s like
to have someone you love walk away from you .
what are you doing ?
what ?
what are you doing ?
the guy &apos;s clearly a psychopath .
you trying to make friends with him , you trying to connect ?
he &apos;s standing right in front of us .
i see he &apos;s standing right here , danny ,
but you &apos;re a cop .
you &apos;re not a therapist , you know ?
hey , hey , hey , i have been trained
for this kind of thing , okay ?
what , what , to bore people into submission ?
don &apos;t listen to him , okay ?
his idea of communication
is @-@ is he drops a witty one @-@ liner
and then shoots you in the face .
don &apos;t worry about it . know what ?
i might shoot this guy just so
he doesn &apos;t have to listen to you talk .
why don &apos;t you do your thing ,
i &apos;ll do mine , all right ?
okay .
matinsky , put the knife down .
it &apos;s over . it &apos;s over !
no ! no ! no ! no !
hey , hey , you &apos;re okay .
come here , come here . you &apos;re all right .
i don &apos;t know that i can do this .
i don &apos;t think you can afford not to .
you accused your daughter @-@ in @-@ law of some pretty terrible things .
she has every reason to hate you right now , but ,
the truth is , she needs you .
you both loved him .
and despite everything , you &apos;re family .
that should stand for something .
do you really think that she &apos;ll forgive me ?
never know unless you try .
take all the time you need .
hey , got a minute ?
yeah .
so , i heard back from my guy over at the hpd archives .
he looked up that case number that your dad had written down .
what did he say ?
the file is missing .
which means it was either lost somehow ...
or somebody stole it ?
yeah . i was able to get a little bit of information
just based on the file number itself .
here &apos;s the thing .
the case was opened on april 19 , 1992 .
that was , uh ... that was the day
my mother had her car accident , the day she died .
yeah .
okay , uh ... why ...
why would somebody steal my mother &apos;s accident report ?
because according to this ,
it wasn &apos;t an accident report .
what are you talking about , chin ?
it was a homicide .
you &apos;re saying that my mother was murdered ?
