第一季 第十八集
i never told the police where you were .
do you believe me ?
that &apos;s what i asked you ...
before the cops picked me up .
i never got an answer , either .
the d.a. is dropping the charges against me . i &apos;m free .
we can get that awful thing off your leg right now .
the cab is waiting .
i &apos;m going with spencer .
well , how did you like mr . fitz ?
every english department has one ,
full of charm and promise .
this is crazy . you can &apos;t keep staying here .
hey , if you need a place to stay ,
there &apos;s an old couch in my basement .
my mom will never know .
i figured out what the message means .
it wasn &apos;t b @-@ a @-@ d . it was the number 214 .
all em , all the time !
don &apos;t tell .
whatever it is you &apos;re holding on to ,
it &apos;s got to stop .
come closer .
i think he &apos;s dangerous .
and i think you need help .
melissa ... spencer , we &apos;re pregnant .
mr. fitz , this is byron montgomery .
i &apos;m sorry about how our meeting went ,
and i &apos;d like to talk to you ,
so maybe we could have a beer ?
if you &apos;re trying out for the bad seed ,
you need to sign up here and wait by the auditorium door
until your name is called .
thank you , and good luck .
start with the line about the stolen medal .
why isn &apos;t she wearing any shoes ?
so she can look short enough to play an eight @-@ year @-@ old .
what &apos;s my line ?
i don &apos;t see anything about a medal .
no , that &apos;s what the eight @-@ year @-@ old killed her classmate for .
penmanship medal . that &apos;s why they call her the bad seed .
a penmanship medal , really ?
didn &apos;t you read the whole play ?
don &apos;t look at me . hanna &apos;s the one trying out .
i &apos;m just here to make her look taller .
why do i have to read the whole play ?
i don &apos;t wanna be the bad seed &apos;s mother .
i want the other mother , the one who &apos;s drunk all the time .
no comment .
are you still ragging on me for bringing a flask to a dance ?
i don &apos;t need another parent , spence . one &apos;s plenty .
well , has the one figured out that caleb &apos;s in your basement ?
no , but &quot; a &quot; has .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna tell my mom before &quot; a &quot; gets to her .
i &apos;m just gonna ask her if caleb can stay in the guestroom .
hey , there , hanna and her clanna !
hey , mona . how &apos;d it go in there ?
honestly , i nailed it . it was epic .
i think mr. fitz cried .
good for you , mona .
i guess the rest of us should go home .
no ! there are no small parts ,
only parts that don &apos;t make it into the yearbook .
good luck .
why don &apos;t you audition ?
you kind of have an in with the director .
stop .
is he wearing the tie you gave him ?
stop !
it would be so awesome to hang out with you two
after school , see you as a couple .
news flash . just &apos; cause we &apos;re on this side of the building
doesn &apos;t mean that we can suddenly light candles and slow dance .
that &apos;s the opening night party .
&quot; hello , aria . &quot; &quot; hello , ezra . &quot;
are you finished ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;ll ever be able
to go on a double date with you guys .
you won &apos;t even send us pictures .
pictures ? hanna , we meet at his apartment .
it &apos;s not sea world .
we &apos;re just saying it &apos;d be nice .
believe me , i know .
wish i could .
but i can &apos;t . um , where &apos;s your other scene ?
is mr. fitz in the auditorium ?
uh , i &apos;m , uh , right here , jenna . what can i do for you ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re interested ,
but i would like to compose some music for the play .
sure . that &apos;d be great .
for the flute ?
yes .
is there a reason that you picked the bad seed ?
it &apos;s one of my favorites .
the theme is so inspiring .
uh , inspiring ?
i &apos;m fascinated by the nature of evil .
mama .
oh , hey . didn &apos;t , uh , wake you , did i ?
sort of .
are you packing or unpacking ?
uh , little bit of both .
you know , i gotta make room .
babies come with a lot of gear .
yeah , it &apos;s time i get rid of some of this dead weight .
what &apos;s in there ?
junk , mostly . yearbooks .
baseball gloves , trophies .
stuff my mom probably wants more than me .
listen , can you , uh , hold this flap down for me ?
it &apos;s a tape gun , spence . you won &apos;t get hurt .
i know that .
really ?
&apos;cause you flinch every time i come near you .
have to go get ready for school .
yeah , melissa told me
what you said to her at the swim meet .
you think i had something to do with
what happened to alison de laurentis ?
well , for the record , i didn &apos;t ...
though i &apos;m not surprised she ended up that way .
what is that supposed to me ?
it means your friend alison was a psycho stalker
who wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer .
okay , someone else probably had enough of her .
yeah , or maybe you had enough of her .
listen , our relationship
could be summed up in two words : get lost .
right , well , it &apos;s too bad she &apos;s not here to defend herself .
trust me , she never played that position .
your friend alison was always on offense .
didn &apos;t i just buy this milk ?
is it sour ?
empty .
and ... so is the butter dish .
why are we going through so many groceries ?
i may have made some mac &amp; cheese for caleb and me .
he stayed over for dinner a couple times .
i thought we talked about this .
i &apos;m not crazy about this friendship .
mom , his home situation sucks .
his foster parents treat him like dirt .
hanna , there are a lot of great families out there
he could be placed with , just not ours .
and ... there &apos;s no sugar , either .
uh , yeah , we made brownies for dessert .
so , i guess this would be a bad time to see
if he can stay in our guestroom for a couple nights ?
ah , so the cat in the hat now wants room and board ?
he never asked . i &apos;m asking .
i mean , how do you expect
him to study or get a good night &apos;s sleep ?
hanna , we need our privacy .
mrs. potter &apos;s nephew is still circling out there .
we &apos;re not in the clear .
i applaud your compassion ,
but i worry about your judgment .
so , is that a maybe ?
and now i &apos;m worried about your hearing .
i &apos;m late . i love you .
she &apos;s gone .
morning .
how much did you hear ?
between you and mommy ? not much .
i will , uh , put some groceries on the back porch .
my parting gift .
caleb , chill .
i &apos;ll talk to her . she &apos;ll come around .
said the girl with poor judgment to the cat in the hat .
surprise .
uh , hey . what &apos;s this ?
your newspaper .
i don &apos;t subscribe .
w @-@ what &apos;s up ? what are you doing here ?
nothing . i just wanted to talk to you before school .
about your dad wanting to take me out for that beer ?
i don &apos;t have to do it , aria .
i can dodge him .
no , don &apos;t dodge him .
i want you to spend some quality time with him .
why ?
because
it &apos;d be cool if my dad could see how special you are .
i want my friends to see that , too .
and why do we suddenly care
what your friends think about me ?
have you told them about us ?
your homies will like me just fine .
i cast spencer and hanna in the school play .
really ? excellent . they &apos;ll be so psyched .
who &apos;s your stage manager ?
ah , couple of kids have asked . why ?
well , you &apos;ll be spending every day after school
and weekends ... so if i &apos;m stage managing
we can see each other all the time .
on campus .
off campus , too . it &apos;ll give us an excuse
to finally have coffee outside this little apartment .
i love this little apartment .
i do . a lot .
aria .
come on .
let me be your stage manager , please ?
part of me says this is a terrible idea .
but i &apos;m not talking to that part .
just say yes , ezra . come on , just say it .
say it .
yes .
caleb , can you get me my mascara ?
i &apos;m in the shower !
can i just come in and grab it ?
sure .
you know , if you guys cleaned this showerhead ,
you could have amazing pressure .
go for it .
hanna ?
is my phone in your bathroom ?
um , i @-@ i-- i &apos;m in the shower , mom !
i was halfway to the bank
when i realized i didn &apos;t have it .
what is with this charger ?
i only have three bars .
uh , i really can &apos;t talk right now , mom .
i &apos;m getting shampoo in my mouth .
okay .
all right . see you at dinner .
wanna share a towel , too ?
that &apos;s awesome . that &apos;s the part you really wanted , right ?
yeah ! it &apos;s pretty cool .
if you guys are all involved ,
maybe i should do props or something .
why is paige mcvullers calling ?
is she still torturing you ?
no , she &apos;s-- we &apos;re cool now .
really ?
what brought you closer , her trying to drown you ?
she &apos;s got a cousin in the military ,
and she &apos;s kind of anxious about it .
did you and toby figure out
that braille thing yet , what 214 means ?
you haven &apos;t given up , have you ?
definitely not . we &apos;re still working on it .
i &apos;m supposed to drop off his french book after school , so ...
can i do it ?
i haven &apos;t seen him since they dropped the charges ,
and i &apos;d kind of like to talk to him again .
yeah .
maybe now he &apos;ll be more willing to hear me
when i say i didn &apos;t turn him in .
what are you looking at ?
i didn &apos;t even know they knew each other .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we don &apos;t know .
what is that ?
what did he just give her ?
so , the play raises an interesting question .
are people born evil , or do they learn it ?
i brought some additional material
to give you guys some background on the period .
what gives , velma ?
did you have a nasty dream last night about shaggy ?
i was in the shower with him .
oh , talk about a wet dream .
no , it wasn &apos;t a dream . he took a shower at my place .
did you lose your v @-@ card ?
no ! nothing happened .
well , that was a waste of water .
are you into him or not ?
okay , you know , i &apos;m just confused .
decide soon . bad boy only showers once a year .
do you need help ?
oh , no , i &apos;m good , thanks .
so , i recommend that you read the novel ,
and to whet your appetites , i copied the first chap--
i @-@ i got it . thanks .
why don &apos;t you hand out the schedules ?
oh , aria , uh , while you &apos;re up ,
could you do me a favor ?
uh , sure . what do you need , mona ?
could you hit the vendy and
grab me a powerbar and some mints ?
i think i should just pass these out ,
but everyone can &quot; hit the vendy &quot; when we go on break , okay ?
i think you &apos;ll see , even with the novel ,
rhoda is not the typical eight @-@ year @-@ old .
only the janitor is--
yes .
uh , i &apos;m guessing this isn &apos;t the varsity booster club .
my bad . sorry .
let &apos;s all take a look at the first scene with rhoda and the janitor ,
if you &apos;ll turn to page 25 .
he is so creepy !
i can &apos;t believe you ever kissed him .
we all wanted to kiss him .
never .
at that frat party
when he was big man on campus ?
the one that alison got us into ?
not me .
yes . you .
you are so bad @-@ ass .
did you make these ?
where &apos;d you get this picture of me ?
i look like my mother .
that is your mother .
so , you guys can thank me later .
wait ! so ...
what do we-- what do we do now ?
act your new age .
oh , excuse me . sorry .
hey , spence , isn &apos;t that your sister &apos;s new boyfriend ?
really ? that &apos;s what i thought . are you-- ?
he &apos;s kinda cute . so &apos;s his friend .
easy . he &apos;s a little bit old for you .
not tonight ... &apos; cause i &apos;m 26 !
put that away .
yeah , and take a math class . you &apos;re 21 .
okay . all right . just right up here .
looks like mr. melissa is giving miss rum &amp; coke a special tour .
maybe he &apos;s just taking her to the bathroom .
or finding an empty room so she can lie down .
yeah , on top of her .
what ?
look , i don &apos;t know about you vestal virgins ,
but i &apos;m here to make some memories .
let &apos;s divide and conquer and meet back here at midnight .
you should &apos;ve said something to your sister that night .
like what ? &quot; i crashed your boyfriend &apos;s frat party &quot; ?
i would &apos;ve been so dead .
like your sister isn &apos;t now ?
yeah , knocked up with his bad seed .
hanna , why do you think that the janitor in the play
is the only one who knows the little girl &apos;s not a liar ?
um , that &apos;s because the janitor is childlike himself .
it &apos;s like when we were reading shakespeare ,
and ezra talked about the fools
and how they can get away with saying ...
things that ... other people can &apos;t .
let &apos;s just focus on this play .
okay ?
spencer asked me to drop off your french book .
there is a reason she didn &apos;t want to ?
no . not at all .
i practically snatched it out of her hand .
i wanted to .
i should be on your porch .
i found out who turned me in .
it was jenna .
her way of keeping me close to home .
well , no one can do that now .
it must feel good , knowing you can ride that whenever you want .
it &apos;ll feel even better when i can get it to move .
so , i was thinking ...
maybe we could go out sometime and celebrate ,
now that this is over .
what happened to maya ?
i meant celebrate as friends .
breakfast or something .
i like breakfast .
tomorrow ?
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re still working .
no , just prepping .
i like to fool myself into thinking
they actually read some of the things i put up here .
well , hope springs eternal .
look at you , you &apos;re teaching , writing ,
directing the school play .
do you even have time for a beer ?
sure . just , uh , don &apos;t tell my students .
it &apos;ll only make them love you more ,
if that were even possible .
my daughter thinks that you are pretty hot stuff .
and you know what ?
after reading your stories that aria gave me ,
i have to agree .
but i gotta say , it &apos;s very bold of you ,
exposing yourself to your students .
come on . you look like you need that beer .
okay , pick up the coat , move stage left ,
and then push him out the door .
can he have lunch first ?
i ... wasn &apos;t talking to you .
oh , you have someone crashing in your attic , too ?
no . i &apos;m learning my lines .
can i help ?
nope .
can i make the sandwich ?
no .
so , how was the rest of your day ?
mine got off to a really strange start .
i was taking a shower--
yeah , you know what ,
you can make a sandwich , and you can eat it , too .
i have to practice being drunk .
can i ... help ?
no !
thanks .
here you go .
you know , when you talk about your writing ,
you seem much more relaxed
than when you talk about your day job .
you &apos;re not hiding out at that high school , are you ?
what ?
listen , ezra , i have known many gifted people
who were too scared to bet on their own talent .
no , no . no . not me . i love teaching high school .
oh , of course you do .
i mean , everybody always loves their first class .
you bond with them in a special way ,
but don &apos;t forget-- the same kids
that you love are gonna move on , you know ?
you know , time goes by so fast .
i mean , aria &apos;s already looking at colleges in california .
you know , if you taught at the college level ,
you &apos;d have a lot more time for your writing .
i need your help .
what &apos;s going on ?
i saw ian hand jenna a bag at school .
so ?
well , do you have any idea what was in it ?
no .
why do they even know each other ?
he &apos;s a coach . what team does she play on ?
i don &apos;t want to have to ask jenna .
we &apos;re not talking much these days .
you don &apos;t have to talk to her . just ...
get her phone .
what ?
we have to find out if ian is in her recent call lists ,
and hanna has a friend who can unlock her password .
i &apos;m not stealing her phone .
toby , we &apos;re no closer
to figuring out what 214 means .
ian might be who she &apos;s whispering to on the other end .
i don &apos;t know . if-- i &apos;ve gotta be careful .
if i start stealing--
if we don &apos;t get to the bottom of this ,
you &apos;re just gonna be waiting around
for the next piece of evidence to be planted in your room .
until they find the real killer ,
your nightmare is never going to end .
we need jenna &apos;s phone .
morning .
is that emily ?
yes .
toby &apos;s not here .
or are you here to see me ?
he &apos;s not here ? we made a--
i said i &apos;d take him out for breakfast .
well , he &apos;s having that with spencer .
he left early this morning .
said he needed to do homework .
it sucks , doesn &apos;t it ?
what ?
feeling like you &apos;re second choice .
how soon can i get it back ?
shouldn &apos;t take him long .
have you eaten ? you want some toast ?
is whole wheat okay ?
she goes ballistic when i touch her stuff .
yeah , i get it . my sister once threatened
to break my thumbs for using her hairbrush .
toby , can i ask you something ?
why was alison so sure it was you
spying on us the night of jenna &apos;s accident ?
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t--
i never spied on anyone .
i never looked in anyone &apos;s window .
your friend alison made that up .
why ? why you ?
because she thought she had something on me .
she-- she didn &apos;t understand what was really going on ,
and she used it against me anyway .
well , it seems like she had something on all of us .
maybe , but you don &apos;t have to live in a town
where everyone believes you killed her .
not everyone .
you did .
yeah . i guess i did .
but i &apos;m not proud of that .
this whole alison thing
has never made any sense to me .
it still doesn &apos;t .
hey . you &apos;re ... already taping .
i thought you wanted me to .
i do . just not sure we &apos;ll have people up on their feet yet .
look . i &apos;m sorry about slipping up yesterday ,
but i don &apos;t think anyone picked up on it .
oh , they did .
i &apos;ll be more careful . i promise .
oh ! so how was that beer with my dad ?
what &apos;d you two talk about ?
lots of stuff .
he offered to help me get a job at hawes college .
why ? you already have a job .
but there &apos;s one class available there ,
and it could lead to something more .
why would you need something more ?
truth is , i ... need something less .
if i worked at hawes ,
i would have more time to do my own writing .
yeah , but teaching here
hasn &apos;t kept you from your writing , has it ?
not entirely , but i gotta think about the future .
so , you &apos;re planning on leaving here ?
maybe , eventually .
but you are , too .
leaving eventually , right ?
oh , hey , mr. fitz .
oh , aria , um , i &apos;m a little parched .
have you had a chance to pick me up some throat coat ?
um , you &apos;re gonna have to go get your own tea , mona .
i &apos;m a stage manager , not a gopher .
wow . you sure bite like one .
where did you get this ? the year 2020 ?
it &apos;s for someone who can &apos;t see .
okay . well , someone who can ,
might need to call nasa to turn it on .
uh , take however long you need .
no . take an hour .
it has to be returned as soon as possible , or the person who
borrowed it might be in trouble .
they should be .
stealing a blind person &apos;s phone ? that &apos;s sick .
what do you like to do for fun on the weekends ?
break old lady &apos;s hips ?
you know what ? just give it back to spencer as soon as you can , okay ?
where does my character sit ?
uh , i haven &apos;t blocked it yet , mona .
we &apos;ll get to that on saturday .
for those of you just arriving ,
the stage has been taped off to mark the living room ,
and the prop table is being stocked as i speak .
wait , this saturday ? i can &apos;t be here this saturday .
i only sent the e @-@ mail
to those who were called for that rehearsal .
well , am i called in or not ?
we &apos;ll be blocking that scene on saturday .
i thought i mentioned that .
you didn &apos;t .
mr. fitz , can we find a way to work out the kinks in the system ?
i assure you , mona , from this point on
aria will be on top of things .
i just need some clarification
from our director on the scheduling .
can we take five , everyone ? !
thanks .
are you still angry at me about yesterday ?
i &apos;m angry at myself because ...
i knew this wasn &apos;t gonna work .
fine . i will help you find a new stage manager .
but it sounds like you &apos;re
trying to replace me in other parts of your life .
who said that ?
you did .
suddenly , everybody &apos;s leaving here .
and why were you talking
about your future versus our future ?
because they may not be linked .
look , i &apos;m not saying i &apos;m leaving here tomorrow ,
but , let &apos;s face it--
we are not tied to this place forever .
you &apos;re looking at colleges in california ,
which you have every right to do .
one , i looked at one college in your favorite city .
we could move there together !
aria , that &apos;s not how it works .
why can &apos;t it if we want it to ?
the whole point of college is to broaden your world ,
oot pack up your high school english teacher and bring him with you .
you &apos;re not just my high school english teacher .
is that how you see yourself ?
no . but you will , when the time comes .
cute couple , aren &apos;t they ?
we should study our lines .
yeah , i still don &apos;t get my second scene .
your character is suspicious .
it doesn &apos;t say that in the script .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s underneath the words .
that &apos;s the reason why she &apos;s drinking .
no , she &apos;s drinking because her kid drowned .
hanna , at this point even the little girl &apos;s
mother thinks that she &apos;s a murderer .
it &apos;s the drowning , the old lady who fell down the stairs ,
the janitor who was set on fire ...
i was just talking about this scene .
she could think it was an accident .
maybe there are no accidents .
what do you mean ?
we never questioned what happened at that party .
all right , i &apos;ll see you guys later , okay ?
hey , mike , i want to see pictures .
i really like that top , em ...
and i think someone else might like it , too .
no .
why ? he &apos;s drooling in his beer pong cup .
just go talk to him .
no .
go talk to him !
are you okay ?
don &apos;t touch her !
i &apos;m gonna go get help !
somebody call 911 !
she &apos;s still breathing .
we should go . now .
why didn &apos;t you tell us about ian at the top of the stairs before ?
i ... i didn &apos;t think about it till now .
what if that girl didn &apos;t fall just &apos; cause she was wasted ?
we &apos;re ... starting .
what &apos;s going on ?
the night that we crashed that frat party .
yeah , what about it ?
we &apos;re thinking alison
wasn &apos;t the first person ian shoved .
i can &apos;t do this right now . this phone is out of my league .
i can &apos;t crack it , and i know you &apos;re dealing with a time issue .
you &apos;re just gonna give up ? this is important !
why ? why are you breaking and
entering jenna cavanaugh &apos;s phone ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
how &apos;d you know it was jenna &apos;s ?
because i &apos;m not blind .
are you gonna get over what happened yesterday morning ?
because i can have that tattoo removed .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so , what do you think ? are people born bad ?
i &apos;m having a hard time figuring out
who &apos;s evil and who &apos;s just naughty .
i think you know the difference , mona .
but let &apos;s ask some of your classmates .
spencer . thoughts ?
yes . some people are pure evil .
we should get out of here .
they &apos;re gonna start questioning everyone .
we can &apos;t leave without alison !
i voted for mini golf .
this was a huge mistake .
what &apos;s going on ? what happened ?
you missed it ? where were you ?
that-- that girl that was with ian--
she fell down the stairs , and it was terrible .
can we just tell her on the bus ?
note to self : don &apos;t drink and dive .
if my mom finds out i was here ,
i &apos;m gonna be grounded until i &apos;m 50 .
guys , if we run away like babies ,
we &apos;ll definitely be questioned .
what is she doing ?
excuse me . my friends and i made the mistake
of having a little drink before we ate ,
and none of us feel comfortable about getting behind the wheel .
can we trouble you for a ride back to rosewood ?
what-- what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking we &apos;re not taking the bus .
chillax , ladies .
the bolder the move , the less anyone questions it .
i think my character &apos;s being totally selfish .
i don &apos;t even know how to play that .
miss verne is protecting the future of her school , mona .
so , is she forgivable or not ?
it &apos;s unforgivable if she &apos;s only thinking of herself .
let &apos;s stop here .
these are all good thoughts .
we &apos;ll pick up where we left off tomorrow .
study your lines . put away your props .
i &apos;ll see you then .
guys .
what are we looking at ?
why would that be in here ?
what &apos;s that ?
is that blood ?
em , where did you get this ?
i didn &apos;t ! i &apos;ve never seen it before .
oh , god , no .
you think that &apos;s what ian used--
to kill alison , don &apos;t you ?
guys , slow down .
we don &apos;t know that that &apos;s alison &apos;s blood .
we don &apos;t even know if that is blood .
yeah , but we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s insane .
why would he hide that in here for everyone to see ?
because it &apos;s a bold move ,
and no one would ever look for it here .
why did the bad seed hide
the medal in the box on top of her desk ?
why didn &apos;t she just bury it ?
because she was eight !
guys , we all saw that video .
ian did not have a trophy in his hand .
we didn &apos;t see what was on the ground .
it could &apos;ve been in his luggage .
this was when they were together at hilton head .
what are we gonna do ?
we hand it in .
we &apos;re not wasting time losing evidence again .
emily &apos;s right .
this goes to the police now .
so , what do we do now ?
just wait .
how long until the police
figure out that it &apos;s alison &apos;s blood ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll tell you this-- i don &apos;t want to go home .
i don &apos;t want to be anywhere near where ian is .
you can stay at my place .
could we just all stay at your place ?
i don &apos;t know , it just feels weird splitting up after this .
i can &apos;t believe we had it ,
the weapon , in our hands .
after all this time , it &apos;s like ...
like ali can finally rest in peace .
yeah . we all can .
we &apos;ll pick up some food on the way to emily &apos;s .
i @-@ i can &apos;t stay over tonight .
look , believe me , i don &apos;t want to go home either ,
but my mom hears something in the basement ...
you haven &apos;t told her about caleb ?
there &apos;s only so much i can do in one day , okay ?
actually , can we just make one stop along the way ?
i @-@ i promise it won &apos;t take long .
yeah , sure .
wait , em . we didn &apos;t call toby .
what ?
we have to tell him what we found .
you tell him .
that should be you .
sorry to bother you , but i &apos;m--
i &apos;m not sleeping tonight until i say this .
take your coat off . sit down .
no , no . i &apos;m not staying .
i just came here to say that
i signed up for the play for all the wrong reasons ,
so i &apos;m officially done .
you &apos;re right , it was a terrible idea .
aria--
but you were wrong too ...
about the future . you have no idea
what &apos;s gonna happen tomorrow . nobody does .
my friend alison , she didn &apos;t .
she didn &apos;t get a future . she didn &apos;t even get to turn 16 .
listen--
no , but let me finish .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna end up in california ,
or some fishing village in guam-- it doesn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;re both here now .
can &apos;t we just be happy that we have that ?
good answer .
didn &apos;t take anything that wasn &apos;t mine , officer .
are you leaving ?
i thought you &apos;d be relieved .
why would you think that ?
because you &apos;ve been treating me
like something you scrape off your shoe ?
at least , since our shower .
look ...
i know . i just ...
i wasn &apos;t ...
ready to see that much of me ?
no .
yes .
what , and now you think you have to throw down , too ?
what if i don &apos;t want to ?
it &apos;s okay .
what if i do want to ?
that &apos;s okay , too .
did you guys sleep at all ?
no . just tossed and turned .
she tossed . i turned .
i cannot wait for him to be carted out of here .
just knowing that he &apos;s in this building now--
thinking he could get away with it ,
her blood in that trophy case
makes me sick .
guys .
oh , my god . they &apos;re going
to drag him out in front of the whole school .
why is he coming over here ?
ladies .
which one of you found the trophy ?
who &apos;s , uh , spencer hastings ?
so , was this a group effort ,
or are you three just along for the ride ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , you should &apos;ve done a little research .
there &apos;s no golf tournament on hilton head on that date .
what about the blood ?
it &apos;s not human blood .
comes from a rat .
no , but why would there--
let &apos;s save our questions for the precinct .
follow me .
detective breyer ?
&quot; a &quot; planted that trophy .
we should &apos;ve known .
guys , where was she that night ?
at the frat party when the girl fell ,
where was alison ?
she wasn &apos;t with us .
she wasn &apos;t with us , either .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying maybe it wasn &apos;t ian who pushed that girl .
maybe-- maybe that drunk girl was just in alison &apos;s way .
why would alison do that ?
because that frat party wasn &apos;t a random pick .
she took us there because she wanted to see ian .
maybe she was stalking him .
wait , so now you believe ian ?
you don &apos;t think he killed alison ?
i didn &apos;t say that . i think he killed her .
there &apos;s just a lot about that night that was still don &apos;t know .
oh , my god .
what ?
what if jenna was also blocking her way to ian ?
what if ali threw that firecracker in toby &apos;s garage
knowing that jenna was in there ?
she had us all fooled ...
until now .
