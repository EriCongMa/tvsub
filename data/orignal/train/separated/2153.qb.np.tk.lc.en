oh , my gosh !
this is amazing !
i &apos;ve never been this close to the fire line before .
i think maybe we should turn around .
are you crazy ?
like now .
don &apos;t be such a chicken .
look , i &apos;ve got my dad &apos;s credit card .
if you don &apos;t want to go back to my place ,
maybe we can get a hotel room ?
you are such a dork .
hi , catherine .
remember me ?
we shot a few rounds of eight @-@ ball down at the sports bar .
oh , and i was your ticket into
the witsec database , too .
agent channing , if you wanted a rematch ,
all you had to do was call .
hands .
who do you work for ?
naval intelligence .
wrong answer .
your interest in doris mcgarrett &apos;s relocation
has nothing to do with navy intel .
so why don &apos;t you tell me who you were working for
when you hacked into her file ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you think this is some kind of a joke ? !
i lost my badge !
it was suspended because of you !
so don &apos;t lie to me !
where &apos;s mangosta ? !
now , who the hell is mangosta ?
got to admit , dumping a body
in the burning sugar cane fields isn &apos;t a bad idea .
can &apos;t be the first one you found out here .
yeah , but the thing is , this body was still alive
when it was set on fire .
that &apos;s why we found it so quick .
couple of kids were out here chasing the fire
and hit the guy with their car .
so what killed him , the fire or the car ?
my preliminary examinations
indicate that the immediate cause of death was
blunt @-@ force trauma due to impact with the car .
however , if the victim
was not set ablaze and hit by the car ,
he would have died as a result
of the gunshot wound he sustained to his chest .
okay , so he was shot ,
burned and hit by a car ?
wow . this guy &apos;s having a great day .
we got metal detectors out in the field
and picked up a nine @-@ millimeter shell casing .
but that &apos;s not all .
please don &apos;t tell me he was poisoned or stabbed .
as far as i can tell , he was not .
however , i did detect traces
of accelerant on his body-- gasoline .
okay , so he was shot , doused with gasoline
and then left in a sugar cane field that was about to be burned .
well , tells me our perp is smart .
knows how to cover his tracks .
intelligence and foresight--
ingredients to a perfect murder .
there &apos;s no such thing .
tell me who mangosta is .
look , i &apos;m sorry you got suspended .
you were right .
i hacked into doris mcgarrett &apos;s
witsec file ,
but i didn &apos;t do it to compromise her safety ,
and i certainly wasn &apos;t working for anyone named mangosta .
who were you working for ?
nobody .
i did it as a favor for her son steve .
he &apos;s a ... a friend , and he needed to find her .
yeah , well , guess what ?
mangosta found her first .
who the hell is he ?
mangosta is a colombian assassin that doris was assigned
to take out 37 years ago .
what , but she didn &apos;t kill him ?
everyone thought she did .
then a man believed to be mangosta resurfaced .
the intelligence community hasn &apos;t been able
to confirm that it &apos;s him yet .
but you think it is ?
that &apos;s right .
and you think he &apos;s going after doris ?
all those years she was in japan , she was off the radar .
going into witness protection actually heightened her profile .
now there &apos;s been a lot of chatter
that mangosta &apos;s on the island .
why else would he be here ?
i need to tell steve .
forget it !
mangosta will smell a full @-@ blown of
coming a mile away .
the only way to catch him is by surprise .
now , you want to protect your boyfriend &apos;s mother ?
you don &apos;t tell anyone anything .
hey , chin , what do you got ?
i.d. &apos; d our vic . his name is aiden o &apos;connell .
we were able to run facial recognition
based on the photos max sent back .
turns out he &apos;s in the system for a couple of duis .
he &apos;s a honolulu local .
what was he doing on maui ?
that &apos;s the question . according to his phone records ,
he made a couple dozen calls
to a dr. olivia victor yesterday .
they finally connected
and had an eight @-@ minute conversation at 6 : 12 p.m.
okay , and this dr. victor lives in maui ?
actually , she &apos;s a psychotherapist
and her practice is in waikiki ,
but a cell tower places her on maui .
she must have been the last person
to talk to him on the phone .
or maybe even saw in person .
see , from what i can gather ,
it looks like aiden actually flew to maui yesterday afternoon
and rented a car at the airport .
maui pd then found that
car abandoned at a gas station .
and there was one address programmed into the gps :
4214 makena lane in lahaina .
拉海纳镇
olivia victor ?
i &apos;m dr. victor .
i &apos;m commander steve mcgarrett .
this is officer kono kalakaua .
we &apos;re with five @-@ o.
is everything okay ?
do you know aiden o &apos;connell ?
he &apos;s my patient .
okay , we &apos;re sorry to inform you of this , ma &apos;am , but he &apos;s dead .
what ? what happened ?
he was murdered .
his body was found up in the cane fields .
here ?
i don &apos;t understand .
what was he doing in maui ?
we were hoping you could tell us .
i have no idea .
because according to phone records ,
you , uh , you spoke to him for eight minutes ,
last night , around 6 : 00 .
aiden may have spoken to someone
on my cell phone last night ,
but it actually wasn &apos;t me because i lost it
yesterday morning on my run .
so , somebody stole your phone ,
spoke to your patient for eight minutes ?
how do you explain that ?
i can &apos;t .
wish i could .
i wish i could tell you what happened .
dr. victor , where were you last night ?
last night , i was here .
was anybody here with you ?
what are you ... ex @-@ military ?
you didn &apos;t answer the question , ma &apos;am .
neither did you .
you in the army or the navy ?
air force ?
navy .
how many times you been deployed ?
last night , you were home alone ?
that &apos;s right .
you in iraq ? afghanistan ?
you seem like you &apos;ve seen a lot of combat .
you see a lot of violence over there ?
dr. victor , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to step away from the car .
kono , call csu ,
get them down here right now
to process this vehicle . there &apos;s evidence on it .
um , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
olivia victor ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of aiden o &apos;connell .
are you sure about this , boss ?
look at her , she &apos;s not exactly shaking in her boots .
that &apos;s a front .
she knows we &apos;re watching .
she &apos;s already lied to us twice , kono ,
once about the cell phone ,
and about where she was last night .
she did this while
destroying evidence right in front of us .
all without breaking a sweat .
commander mcgarrett , we &apos;re gonna have to release her .
no , not yet .
we can &apos;t just hold her on a hunch .
the car came back clean except for one sugar cane stalk .
and as you know , that stuff &apos;s all over the island .
what about her cell phone ?
no signal .
and there &apos;s nothing to contradict her alibi .
and there &apos;s nothing to prove it either , right ?
yeah , but that &apos;s not probable cause .
sorry , commander .
i wish i could say it was
a pleasure to meet you , commander .
you killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
boy , you have some issues , don &apos;t you ?
maybe , but murder &apos;s not one of them .
i was trying to help him . i didn &apos;t kill him .
yeah , you did .
okay , well , i guess you &apos;ll just have to prove it then .
马卡尼凯直升机停机坪
all right , this woman is smart .
we need to be smarter .
but if she thinks she committed
the perfect murder , she &apos;s wrong .
somewhere along the way she messed up ,
that &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna catch her .
okay , the whole &quot; i lost my cell phone &quot; thing is kind of weak .
the problem is , it could be true .
and sugar cane is everywhere on maui .
all right , what &apos;s your theory ?
my theory ? olivia was aiden &apos;s shrink .
that &apos;s a pretty intimate relationship .
okay , so you &apos;re thinking
that she should know what aiden might
have been into that could have gotten him murdered .
exactly-- instead , she &apos;s lying to us .
she &apos;s claiming complete ignorance .
i don &apos;t buy it for a second . all right ?
whatever went on between the two of them that made him
call her 27 times yesterday ,
is damning to her .
yeah , well , she wouldn &apos;t be the first
shrink to sleep with a patient .
that &apos;s right ,
and if she broke it off and he threatened
to turn her in for professional misconduct ,
that &apos;s motive .
no , it &apos;s a theory .
that &apos;s my gut .
okay , does your gut
have any evidence that we can bring to a prosecutor ?
not yet .
but if aiden was sleeping with the good doctor ,
maybe his wife knew something about it .
you got to be kidding me .
what , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
that &apos;s her .
that &apos;s olivia .
what is she doing here ?
did you see that ?
yeah , i saw it .
really sorry for your loss , mrs. o &apos;connell .
it &apos;s just such a shock .
i think that &apos;s the hardest part .
i feel like i &apos;ve been ambushed .
we , uh , we happened to arrive
just as olivia victor was leaving .
what was she doing here ?
she came to offer her condolences .
you know your husband tried to call her the day he died ?
she said that .
she felt so bad about losing her cell phone .
she said she couldn &apos;t help thinking that maybe if ...
she talked to aiden , things would have been different .
what do you think ? do you think that &apos;s true ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll never know a lot of things .
aiden left me a message yesterday ,
saying that he wanted to talk about something .
something that he needed to make amends to me for .
do you know what that could be about ?
aiden &apos;s been a recovering alcoholic for the last six months .
they go through these phases .
i think he was stuck in the guilt thing . you know ...
taking responsibility for past transgressions .
dr. victor &apos;s really been helping him with that .
mrs. o &apos;connell , i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t mean any disrespect , but ...
is it possible there could have been more
to your husband &apos;s relationship with dr. victor ?
i &apos;m not gonna sugarcoat things
and say that our relationship was perfect .
it wasn &apos;t .
there was a time that
i did suspect aiden of cheating on me , but ...
dr. victor , she was part of the solution .
not part of the problem .
okay , look ...
i am just saying that maybe ,
perhaps , you have misjudged olivia victor .
i don &apos;t think so .
okay . well , i &apos;m just suggesting it ,
because there really seems to be no evidence
that she was sleeping with aiden o &apos;connell , okay ?
and we have run her background .
it was clean-- no criminal history ,
no professional complaints filed against her ever .
doesn &apos;t prove she didn &apos;t do it .
you saw her at the house ,
the way she looked at me when she drove away-- what was that ?
you accused her of murder .
how &apos;s she supposed to look at you ?
i &apos;d say that was remarkably courteous .
okay , listen , you don &apos;t get it , danny .
no .
she needed to get to lindsay o &apos;connell first .
she needs to control the narrative .
the narrative ?
okay , well , there &apos;s actually another explanation .
uh , it is possible that olivia victor is what is known as--
get this-- a caring therapist .
something you should consider seeking out personally ,
because i cannot figure out
what it is about this woman that &apos;s got you so nuts .
you didn &apos;t see her on maui .
this whole thing is a game to her .
she gets off on it .
and besides pissing me off , it makes her dangerous .
you got a problem with shrinks .
i got a problem with shrinks that kill their patients
and then lie about it .
what do you got ?
we ran aiden o &apos;connell &apos;s financials
and we found something interesting .
in the past three months ,
he &apos;d been writing checks to
a private investigator named barry martin
to the tune of $ 30,000 .
whoa , private investigator ?
maybe we got it backwards , right ?
maybe aiden was the one who thought
his wife stepping out on him , not the other way around .
maybe he found out he was right .
that would explain
the desperate attempts to talk to his shrink .
and if that &apos;s why he hired a p.i. ,
then aiden &apos;s wife and her lover are
more viable suspects than olivia victor .
all right , all right .
we got an address for this p.i. ?
i already reached out .
his office puts him on a stakeout in ala moana .
all right , you guys go talk to him , see what he knows .
danny and i are gonna go see what we can learn
from aiden &apos;s patient file .
there &apos;s no way mangosta &apos;s alive .
i planted the explosive charge in his room myself .
did you actually see his body ?
no , agent channing ,
i didn &apos;t stick around for the aftermath of the explosion .
but there &apos;s no way he survived that .
you did .
you used the same tactic to fake your own death .
who &apos;s to say mangosta didn &apos;t pull it off , too ?
this is the man we believe to be mangosta .
he &apos;s traveling under the name fernando gorza ,
which is not in any known database--
it &apos;s definitely an alias .
which certainly doesn &apos;t prove it &apos;s mangosta .
i can &apos;t tell anything from that .
doris , use your imagination .
okay , he &apos;s 30 years older than when you last saw him .
is there anything about him that looks familiar ?
i don &apos;t know .
it can &apos;t be him , okay ?
but if it is ?
you think it &apos;s just a coincidence that he resurfaced
just as you showed up on the island ?
there &apos;s a whole protocol for requesting
patient records-- i just can &apos;t give you a file .
sure , you can-- i asked you nice , come on .
listen , we &apos;re investigating a murder , okay ?
somebody &apos;s died .
i get that you &apos;re cops ,
but i still think you &apos;re gonna need a court order .
what ? come on .
commander mcgarrett ,
you seem to have an unhealthy attachment to me .
no , just investigating aiden o &apos;connell &apos;s murder .
don &apos;t you want to help us find his killer ?
of course i do .
okay , great .
then you won &apos;t mind letting us see his patient file .
right , except that you and i both know that every jurisdiction
recognizes doctor / patient privilege ,
so the files are confidential .
that privilege lies with aiden and does not survive death .
fair enough .
uh , jane , can you give him aiden o &apos;connell &apos;s file ?
although , i don &apos;t know
if you &apos;ll be able to interpret my case notes .
why , your handwriting that bad ?
no , i was referring to your reading comprehension skills .
it appears that maybe they topped out
at fifth grade level ?
oh , you know what ? i got a dictionary standing by ,
so don &apos;t worry about that , okay ?
give the man whatever he wants , jane .
thank you . oh , and by the way ,
why &apos;d you go straight to lindsay o &apos;connell
when you got back to honolulu ?
are you serious ?
i am serious .
aiden o &apos;connell was my patient .
okay .
what &apos;s the matter with you , commander ?
is it your mommy ?
is it your daddy ?
is it abandonment ?
or ...
betrayal ? maybe both .
i bet your mommy &apos;s the reason why you &apos;re not married .
you been checking up on me ?
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
you &apos;re not wearing a wedding ring .
okay .
that &apos;s enough . why don &apos;t we all cool it ?
relax , and ...
there &apos;s something wrong with the file .
aiden &apos;s records are gone .
well , it &apos;s probably a virus .
it probably is a virus-- how convenient .
can you just check the backup file ?
i did . same thing .
you know what ? nice ploy , all right ?
pretend to be cooperative .
you know nothing &apos;s in there .
that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;d like you to leave my office .
leave your office ?
yeah , let &apos;s go .
with pleasure . okay ? i look forward to seeing you soon .
that &apos;s the p.i. &apos; s van .
looks like barry bailed on the stakeout .
maybe .
barry martin .
okay , thanks , chin .
what &apos;s up ?
they found a laptop in the p.i. &apos; s van .
anything on it that would explain
why aiden would &apos;ve hired him ?
bunch of encrypted files .
chin just dropped it off to fong .
so we &apos;re back to square one .
back to square one--
olivia victor &apos;s behind both murders .
how do you figure ?
we got nothing , zero ,
connecting olivia victor to our dead p.i.
no , correction , we have nothing to connect her yet .
we will-- we just need to figure out what it is .
okay , okay .
excuse me , uh , if i may , um ,
i saw the way that she interacted with you , okay ?
she deliberately provokes you ,
and i am starting to think that is maybe not so much about her
specifically , but this is about you , my friend .
what is that supposed to mean ?
i &apos;ll tell you what it &apos;s supposed to mean :
she challenges you ,
you allow her to get under your skin .
is that right ?
that is right .
she &apos;s defiant , she stands up to you .
all right ? and she likes it , not for nothing , but she enjoys it .
okay , you hate being challenged like that ,
it is offensive to your entire world view , okay ?
and she senses that .
do you charge by the hour , or what ...
i &apos;m just making a point .
did you get anything off the laptop ?
uh , fong &apos;s still working on it , but there &apos;s someone here
who says he has information on a case .
he says he &apos;ll only talk to you .
send him in . hey , come in !
steve mcgarrett ?
yeah .
how you doing ?
good .
consider yourself served .
excuse me .
... restraining order .
congratulations , buddy .
olivia victor got a restraining order against you .
you are to stay at least
500 yards away from her at all times .
are you happy now ?
you are smiling-- why are you smiling ?
i &apos;m ecstatic . don &apos;t you get it ?
she knows we &apos;re onto her .
her next move is to try to get off the island .
i gotta put her on the no @-@ fly list .
whoa , whoa , is that a good idea ?
no , no . no .
it is the exact definition of a terrible idea .
okay , steve ? you have to read this thing .
you cannot-- i repeat , not--
put olivia victor on the no @-@ fly list .
you &apos;re absolutely right , i cannot .
but i know somebody who can .
if &quot; fernando gorza &quot; is the alias that mangosta &apos;s using ,
he just rented a car at the airport
and is staying at the ho &apos;okipa hotel .
we should check that out .
put it away .
in the bedroom .
cath , come on !
yeah !
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you today .
cath , uh , i need ...
a favor ? of course .
so , what , a courtesy ,
an indulgence , a dispensation ...
you &apos;re so beautiful when you &apos;re sarcastic .
would you just ask me , already ?
all right . i need you to put a dr. olivia victor
on the no @-@ fly list .
you could ... uh , you could do that .
no , i can &apos;t .
she , um ...
she has a restraining order against me .
a restraining order ?
yeah .
what did you do ?
i did my job .
how close can you get ?
500 yards .
oh , god . you &apos;ve never been good at first impressions .
i know , but seriously , cath ,
uh , if i put her on the no @-@ fly list ,
it &apos;s gonna look like harassment .
steve ... it would be harassment .
i get that .
i &apos;m sorry .
you okay ? what &apos;s going on ?
i am , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m fine .
i just ... i need this done .
okay . you sure you &apos;re okay ?
this woman has murdered two people .
all right ? now she &apos;s playing me .
i hate being played .
i just ... i really need you , cath .
i need your help .
you got it .
you &apos;re like a bad penny , commander .
listen , if you want to talk to me ,
i &apos;ll be at cafe julia in about ten minutes .
sit down .
i won &apos;t bite .
you took out a restraining order against me .
this &apos;ll be our secret .
go ahead . ask me whatever you want .
why &apos;d you kill aiden o &apos;connell ?
why do you think i killed him ?
maybe you were sleeping with your patient ,
maybe you broke it off ,
maybe he threatened you ...
i don &apos;t know , you tell me .
generally , people kill for one of three reasons , commander :
money , sex or revenge .
i find it really interesting
that your fantasy about my guilt involves sex .
you already have money , right ?
and revenge means nothing to a sociopath .
that is no way to seduce a woman , commander .
that is what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
what i want ...
is for you to tell me why you killed him .
and then what i want
is to see you in prison .
even if i did kill aiden ...
you &apos;ll never be able to prove it .
is that a confession ?
tell me what happened .
i know you want to . just tell me what happened .
oh , my god !
thank god you &apos;re here !
i have a restraining order against this man .
i don &apos;t really know what i &apos;m supposed to do anymore
about this , he just keeps stalking me .
that &apos;s not true , duke . that &apos;s not true .
she asked me to meet her here . okay ?
okay , ma &apos;am .
why don &apos;t you go home ? i &apos;ll take it from here .
thank you so much .
thank you .
what &apos;s going on , duke ?
you tell me .
she called me ; she said you were following her .
this was her idea .
maybe so , steve ,
but she does have a restraining order .
and the next time , i &apos;m gonna have no choice
but to arrest you .
okay , okay .
any word from fong ?
yeah , he said there were dozens of audio files
on our dead p.i. &apos; s computer .
unfortunately , he &apos;s still working on decrypting those .
but in the meantime , he managed to recover these photos .
so there are eight different men in the photos .
one is aiden o &apos;connell ,
another one , i i.d. &apos; d from the license plate of his car .
that &apos;s judge ted reynolds .
okay . so he was working eight different cases ,
each one targeting one of these guys .
except when i pulled the financials on judge reynolds ,
he paid our p.i. $ 20,000 the last two months .
aiden was paying him , too .
so why would they be writing the checks ,
when they &apos;re the ones under surveillance ?
that &apos;s the question .
check this out .
he wasn &apos;t working on eight different cases .
these guys are all part of one big case .
they &apos;re at the same location .
and not just any location .
that &apos;s the building where olivia victor &apos;s office is .
steve was right about her .
i &apos;m in .
there &apos;s nothing here .
catherine , he &apos;s back .
time to go .
safe &apos;s locked .
stall him .
i &apos;ll do what i can ,
but he &apos;s heading back up to the room .
excuse me .
sorry .
i &apos;m calling witsec for backup .
evacuate the room .
he &apos;s about to get off the elevator at 14 .
safe &apos;s empty .
then get out of there .
catherine , do you copy ?
there &apos;s gotta be something in here .
forget it , he &apos;s coming down the corridor . abort !
found something .
what is it ?
he &apos;s got pictures of doris .
you &apos;ve got ten seconds . get out of there now .
what the hell are you trying to prove here , channing ?
mangosta was on the island . he was here .
well , he &apos;s not here now .
he must &apos;ve made me in the elevator .
you shouldn &apos;t have been in that elevator .
go home , channing .
hey ! channing .
what happened ?
by the time the witsec agents got up there ,
mangosta was gone and the room was clean .
no , i know what i saw .
mangosta was there .
he &apos;s stalking doris , and whatever his plan was ,
he &apos;s accelerating it .
he &apos;s definitely going after her .
okay , i am not here to judge you , but ...
but ? but what , huh ?
you &apos;re either here to judge or you &apos;re not .
what the hell is the matter with you ?
is there something wrong with your brain ?
she did this , danny , okay ?
and she killed two people . i &apos;m not wrong about that .
okay . i &apos;m only gonna say this one time :
you might be right about olivia . okay ?
wait a minute , you find something ?
fong decrypted some audio files off that p.i. &apos; s laptop .
we got to go see a judge . come on .
we need a warrant ?
not exactly .
dr. victor is my therapist .
and that is not open for discussion .
really ?
okay , well , let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s not discuss it then .
let &apos;s all be quiet and just , uh , and just listen .
obviously , olivia &apos;s office was bugged .
we know that one of those heavy breathers
is you , because it matches the date and time
you signed in for one of your sessions .
it gets very interesting around the five @-@ minute mark ,
but i &apos;ll spare everybody in the room .
where did you get that ?
we got that off barry martin &apos;s computer .
sound familiar , that name ?
you know , it &apos;s the p.i.
that you paid a 20 @-@ stack retainer to .
why did you hire him , by the way ?
i didn &apos;t . my wife did .
she thought i was having an affair .
smart lady .
so , wait a minute , martin was blackmailing you ?
yeah .
so , what , that &apos;s why you killed him , &apos; cause he found out
you were sleeping with your shrink ?
whoa , whoa , back off .
i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
i didn &apos;t know he was dead .
and olivia victor &apos;s
not my shrink .
well , what is she ?
she &apos;s my madam .
your madam ? !
so olivia victor &apos;s therapy practice was a front
for a prostitution ring .
i mean , it is genius .
it &apos;s genius . i mean , think about it .
anybody going to therapy has got deep pockets , right ?
wives are never gonna question those charges
and a cop is never gonna go sweat a shrink .
exactly . barry martin figured it out ,
he started blackmailing her johns .
he &apos;s got the whole place bugged already ,
so he knows that judge reynolds is not
the only one having , uh , sessions .
and he realizes this is a way to make a ton of loot .
all he &apos;s got to do is i.d. the patients ,
find them , and then threaten to expose what was going on .
exactly . definitely sounds like what happened with aiden .
right ? and then it spiraled from there .
and if this is what aiden
was gonna come clean to his wife about ,
it would &apos;ve exposed olivia &apos;s entire operation .
exactly .
she needed to get rid of them both , now she has .
doris , we were right .
