You're getting out today, huh? That's what we heard.
Hello, if you need a pill, call Kelsey.
What's it gonna be, Kelsey? Where'd you get the drugs?
So what happened?
They think that I stole your brother's pills.
What'd you tell them?
I didn't tell them
it was you.
Why not?
Why do you have to ruin everything?
Jude, stop.
They were gonna keep us.
Well, you don't just ruin things for you,
you ruin them for me too.
Everything OK?
She ran away.
What about Jude?
He's better off without me.
Where's Callie?
Callie!
Hey, you gotta pay for that.
I don't have any money.
Hey, you take one bite of that candy bar,
I'm gonna call the cops. One bite!
演唱者 Kopecky Family Band
Callie, I'm Ed Craig, your new P.O.
Have a seat.
How're you doing in here?
OK.
This is your second time in Juvie?
Yeah.
You were in last time for
taking a bat to your foster father's car?
He was beating my little brother at the time.
You love your brother?
Of course.
Just two weeks ago you told your social worker
you liked your new foster home.
Did something change?
They asked us if they could adopt us.
And that's not what you want?
I'm sixteen. I don't need to be adopted.
Any idea what you do need?
Yeah... to be out of the system... on my own.
Then why'd you get yourself arrested and sent back here?
Callie, you're still a kid.
Like it or not, you need an adult to care for you.
Whether it's in the system or back with your foster moms...
No, I can't go back there.
You can send me to a different foster home,
or leave me here, I don't care.
Just... I want them to adopt my little brother.
I do.
So, just tell them...
To give up on you?
So... I'm going back to work next week.
Just wanted to let everybody know.
What about Dad?
Captain Roberts says that he should be cleared in a couple days.
Are you scared?
I'm not. Are you?
A little.
Yeah?
Can't you get like a desk job or something?
Did you know being a cop
is not even one of the top ten most dangerous professions?
That's true. We're lucky
she's not an airplane pilot, or a logger.
Or a crab fisherman. That's very dangerous.
Or an ice road trucker.
Is that what it's called an "ice road trucker"?
What's going to happen to Callie?
Well, tomorrow, sweetheart, she gets to go before the Judge
and the Judge will decide if she gets more probation or...
Stays in Juvie? She got beat up last time.
I know it's scary, sweetheart,
but we're gonna do whatever we can.
Can we go to court with you?
What?
Callie doesn't want us to be there.
Too bad.
I mean you have to talk to the Judge, right?
So that way she can come home.
Unless you don't want her anymore.
Of course we want her.
It is not a question of whether we want Callie.
It is...
It is whether she wants us.
She does.
She ran away, Brandon. For no reason.
I'm not really sure that she wants to be here.
She didn't run away for no reason.
Is there something you want to share with us?
Something you know that we don't?
She ran away because I kissed her.
When did this happen?
At the wedding.
When at our wedding?
Honey...
Do you have any idea what you've done?
I didn't expect this to happen.
Well, what did you expect?
Let's just take a second.
No.
You expected that we were gonna adopt her
and the two of you would date?
I don't know!
I... I can't.
Brandon, did Callie run away because she didn't feel safe?
What? No. No!
Jude saw us, OK? And he freaked out.
He said that you guys wouldn't adopt them. That's why she left,
so she wouldn't screw things up for him.
Honey. If CPS found out,
they could take Callie and Jude out of this house.
You knew that, Brandon. I warned you.
I'm sorry.
Well, sorry doesn't hack it.
I can't help how I feel.
Go inside, please.
We need to talk.
Are you so horny you can't keep your hands off our foster sister?
OK, you know what? She kissed me too.
I'm tired of everyone's making me seem like I'm some sort of...
Liam?
Screw you.
I'm surprised you haven't tried.
Mariana, that's gross.
Look, I didn't grow up with Callie.
She's been here two months and until a few days ago,
this was only supposed to be a temporary thing.
Well, then, why would you say that we could adopt them?
Because I wanted her to be happy.
And you think she's happy now? In Juvie?
I don't expect you to understand.
OK, you've never even had a boyfriend.
Well, you know what I can understand?
You've royally screwed this whole family.
Look, you get it, right?
You couldn't help how you felt about Lexi.
We weren't gonna adopt Lexi.
Why did you tell?
Because now that they know why she left,
they'll bring her back.
I should have seen this was happening.
Me too.
When did we become these parents who have no idea
what the hell is going on underneath their own roof?
When we became parents of teenagers,
who are impulsive and secretive.
Even the Brandons.
What are we gonna do?
Hey, sweetheart.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Come here and sit, please.
We want you to know that this does not change anything.
It does not change how much we love you.
And want to adopt you. OK?
Well, what about Callie?
We're not giving up on either one of you.
I promise.
Callie Jacob?
Just nine weeks out of juvie and you're back for running away,
violating your probation and stealing.
Do you have anything you want to say?
No...
Your Honor.
Your Honor, Callie's foster moms are present in the court,
and would like to speak on her behalf.
Go ahead.
Your Honor, in the time that Callie has been with
my wife and me and our three other children,
we saw her make great strides.
She opened up to us emotionally, she did well in school,
she followed our rules,
and we feel that she has come to trust us,
as we have her.
She brought a great deal of
love and joy into our family and we just...
we feel she deserves a second chance.
However...
we are not prepared to bring her back into our home at this time.
演唱者 Anabel Englund
You're Mariana, right?
Yeah.
Can I sit?
Um, sure.
Cool.
I'm Chase.
I'm Mariana... Oh... you... you're a senior.
That's true.
How do you know who I am?
You helped hang posters for the last school play.
Check it out. We're doing The Glass Menagerie next,
and we need people to help crew.
And, you like, remembered me?
You made an impression.
So, if you're interested, we're having a meeting after school.
It'd be cool to see you there.
"Where have you been all this time?"
"I have been to the movies."
"All this time at the movies?"
There was a very long program that was...
We don't need to do this speech.
OK. "Tom, shhh!"
We have to break up.
I'm pretty sure that's not a line in the play.
I'm so sorry, Talya.
We... we...
I should have never gotten back with you.
Then why did you?
I don't know.
I really care about you, OK, I really do...
...but...
You don't love me.
So, honestly this time... is it because of Callie?
Talya...
Just... I just need to hear you admit it.
So I know I'm not crazy.
Yes. It's Callie.
Brandon.
What?
She's just going to hurt you.
You... You don't know...
I don't.
...everything.
Sending Chase out with flyers was obviously the right strategy.
Of course, not a lot of boys showed up.
But that's OK. Girls work harder. Except me.
I'm the lighting designer,
which is kind of a big deal since I'm only a freshman.
Oh, but I'm fifteen.
My parents held me back for years so I'd be better at sports.
Definitely not the right strategy.
Uh... I'm Zac by the way.
Mariana.
All right, let's get started.
First, thanks for representing.
It's awesome to see so much interest in the school play.
Yeah, right. The play.
Now, we need to fill a lot of crew positions,
but, one of the most important, is costumes.
Otherwise, we're going to be like, on stage naked.
But seriously, the costume designer
helps us create our characters.
It's a totes collaborative thing.
"Totes?"
Mariana.
And... Kelsey.
Don't feel too bad, he knows everyone's name.
I mean, except, mine.
I have an idea, it's a big job so,
why don't the two of you work together?
So, there's this hot new vintage store downtown.
I was thinking...
I can't do costumes with you.
But, I thought we made up at Wyatt's party?
You lied. You put the blame on Callie.
I was covering your ass.
Look, everybody knows I went to rehab.
But what they don't know is that you were my dealer.
Do you know why?
Because I kept that a secret...
because I thought you were my friend.
I guess I was wrong.
Are they here?
Inside. Hey, wanna give me a hand...
I'll help.
Great.
You gotta beat me at a game of 21 first.
All right.
You're on.
Age before beauty.
演唱者 The Futures League
Too easy.
Is she here?
No.
Well, what did the judge say? When is she coming home?
Sit. Let's talk.
Callie's not coming home.
Forever?
No, but not...
Not until we've all had time to figure out how this can work.
The two of you under the same roof.
I'll go live with Dad then.
That's not an option.
Why not?
Callie has bigger issues to deal with.
She makes reckless decisions, Brandon.
Whenever she feels out of control or confused...
She needs to learn coping skills.
So she's going to learn them in juvie?
Judge agreed to send her to a group home.
What?
Once you're in a group home you're considered like high risk.
She told me. No one will ever want her again.
We still want her.
Well, that's not what she's gonna think.
She's gonna think you're giving up on her.
Like you're throwing her to the wolves.
Well, we hope that eventually she'll see we're doing this
because we don't want to give up on her.
And because we love her.
So, what is this like "tough love" then?
You know how this is gonna feel to Callie?
After all she's been through? Like no love.
I want to see her.
No.
Not right now.
Why not?
Because you and Callie need a little time and space to...
What? To get over each other?
Well, that's not gonna happen. OK? We're in love.
And--and keeping us apart is not gonna to change that.
How long do I have to be here?
Until the judge is convinced you won't run away again.
This is a safe place.
Hey, Ed. Hi, Callie, I'm Rita.
Welcome to Girls United. Come on in.
I'll show you to your room after you meet all the girls.
There are seven girls who live here full-time.
Actually one just went home yesterday,
so, your timing was kind of perfect.
We appreciate you taking Callie on such short notice.
Your foster moms worked very hard to get you in here.
Do I have to share a room?
Yes, you will.
Why are there no bars or security gates?
How do you lock us in?
We don't.
We trust that you won't leave the premises.
But, if you violate that trust, then...
you go back to juvie.
Or you're placed in a more restrictive group home.
The choice is really yours.
Hey, girls. Come meet Callie.
OK, ladies, you know how this works.
We're gonna go around the room, tell a little about yourself.
Your age, where you're from, how long you've been here,
why you're here.
All right, we're going to start with you, Kiara,
since you're Callie's roommate and you'll be her sponsor.
Why don't you start us off.
OK. Hi. I'm Kiara. I'm fifteen.
I've been in juvie, like, three times? No, four.
The first time I got arrested was for
throwin' bricks at a building when I was like eleven,
And then for gang stuff you know,
possessing and selling drugs, assault with a deadly weapon.
But that was like, not my fault, anyway. That's me.
I'm Becka, I'm sixteen...
Oh, and I been here two months.
And I'm always interrupting.
Yes, you are.
Yeah, so, Kiara's been interrupting me
the four weeks I've been here.
Becka. Feet.
I'm in for drugs.
Using and selling. And I, like, punched a cop.
I was shooting drugs in my neck before I came here.
So, if I wasn't here, I'd probably be dead now.
I'm Carmen, I'm 17, I wanna join the Army...
Are we suppose to say what we wanna be?
That's OK, honey, keep going.
So, like I been in this home for six months.
In juvie three times for gangs, drugs...
Um, what else...
Kidnapping.
Yeah.
Really?
She asked.
OK. Zip it. Cole, you're up.
My name is Cole. I'm 15. I've been here 3 weeks.
I hate it. What else?
Why are you here?
Stealing and prostitution.
Thank you for sharing.
Daphne, you're up.
I'm Daphne, 17, been here for about six weeks.
In for gangs, drugs, armed robbery and assault.
Oh, and just so you know, Callie,
we have a zero tolerance policy for violence.
If you put your hands on anyone else
you'll be asked to leave. No exceptions, all right?
I'm Gabi, I'm fifteen. I've been here a month.
I'm in for home invasion, robbery, and cyber bullying.
So, now you know a little bit about everyone,
why don't you tell us a little bit about you.
I'm 16. I ran away.
I stole a sandwich.
I don't belong here.
Anyone else feel they don't belong here?
OK.
Happy to have you, Callie.
Jude.
I really thought that...
I had no idea that they'd do this.
OK?
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
Dinner's ready. Mama said to ask Mike.
Really?
Traveling!
What?
Ah, it was so traveling!
It's Jesus' ball.
No way!
How was school, young lady?
Anything new and exciting?
I'm doing costumes for the school play.
You are? That's a big undertaking.
You can handle that?
Well, if it's only a four character play.
Well, good for you, I'm very proud of you.
You OK, babe?
What's wrong, baby?
Jesus? Jesus, what's going on?
What is going on?
Mariana, go get Lena.
Jesus. Jesus. Relax, relax.
Shh. Slow. Slow breaths.
I'm fine. I probably just got, like, dehydrated.
So, Dr. Levinson thinks
it's just a short term side-effect from upping his meds.
So, what's in his meds that would make his heart race?
Well, they're stimulants, Mike.
In kids with ADHD
it actually help them to calm down and to focus.
And there's no other way to treat it without medication?
There is behavioral modification.
It's controversial, Mike.
And, it's not like we haven't talked about it a thousand times.
Well, not with me.
I don't wanna take this stuff.
If I can get off it, don't I get a say?
Jesus, remember when you went off the pills for a few days?
You got really aggressive.
And you were bouncing off the walls too, dude, remember?
I mean, come on, I was bouncing off the walls when I was his age.
What about getting into a contact sport?
I mean, it helped me.
Like football, no, no way.
No, like wrestling.
No way. I'm not groping dudes.
It's not groping.
It's using strategic moves to take down your opponent.
It's physical, gets the aggression out, teaches you mental focus.
I mean, that's what he needs, right?
Can I at least try it?
Lena?
OK?
OK.
But, Jesus, you need to be extremely disciplined.
Very.
I will be.
Do I have to wear a unitard?
OK, rule number one. Never, ever call it a unitard.
It's called a singlet.
Uh... yeah, this needs a touch up.
Why?
It's sticky, you gotta wipe it again.
Looks clean to me.
Well, I'm Kitchen Foreman
and if you don't do your job, I get a UA.
Cut the newbie a break, Nicole.
That's not my name.
Really? 'Cause it says on your birth certificate.
But, then it also says you're a girl.
I'm a transgender male. Look it up, bitch.
Ooh, who's gettin' a UA now.
Why you gotta be like that?
It's not Cole's fault he was born in the wrong body.
Look, You all trippin'.
Let's just do our jobs without no drama for once?
We all done in here?
Yeah, so done.
All right, yeah, looks good.
Hey, Daphne, show Callie where the trash is.
I'm lookin' at it.
Oh, snap.
Chill out, everybody.
Let's go.
Most of the food waste we compost for the community garden,
blue's for bottles and cans only, green's for...
Green waste. Yep. It's not my first time taking out the trash.
You know me, right?
Yeah. I know you.
Why? You wanna take another crack at my face?
Look, I put hands on you, in juvie, and I'm sorry about that.
I'm doin' real good here.
I got my privileges, and if I keep tight,
I'll be out in two weeks.
So. We straight?
No, we're not straight.
演唱者 Stigma
How about you knock?
How about you check the attitude? Move over.
So, Mom and Lena told me about Callie.
OK, Dad, I'm not really in the mood for another lecture.
I'm not in the mood to give one.
Look, I understand.
She's not your sister.
Yet.
You two have been through a lot together. She's pretty.
I get it.
It's more than that.
I know, Brandon. But, you'll get over it. Trust me.
If you're talking about Mom, no offense,
but you didn't really have a choice.
Look, Brandon. Callie didn't just run away,
she ran away with a guy. A guy she'd been dating.
For all you know, that was part of the plan all along.
It wasn't.
Really?
Has she reached out to you? At all?
Mom and Lena told me, Wyatt wasn't just a ride.
She was planning to go all the way to Indiana to live with him.
No. Why are you telling me this?
Because you need to hear it.
What's a UA?
It's a "Unacceptable" for like not doing your jobs
or gettin' into it with the other girls.
If you get five you get a consequence, like an extra job.
This is worse than juvie.
Yeah, they're hard on you here,
but it's better than other homes I been in.
Like this one I broke this girl's nose,
I mean, like, I didn't mean to.
She was on the ground and I was kicking her,
but like the staff didn't even care.
At least here they care about you.
Um... so other than school, do we ever get out of here?
Yeah, sometimes we go on field trips,
and every once in a while we get to go to the mall.
Saturday's Family Day.
If you got your privileges, you can have visitors.
Your mom or dad around?
No, I'm in foster care with my brother.
I have a brother.
That's him.
Does he ever come visit you?
Nah. I don't know when I'll get to see him again.
He just got twenty-five to life.
Hey, girls?
How ya doin' K? You settling in OK, Callie?
Yeah.
OK, listen, I know the first night can be a little bit rough.
So, we got Michelle downstairs,
If you need anything, just get a hold of her, OK?
How do I get my privileges?
The girls in the house vote on that.
Yeah... um... so, like what's your job?
My job? Mostly I'm here to encourage peer accountability.
which in Laymen's terms means I'm the referee.
Get some sleep. All right, ladies?
Good night, K.
演唱者 Lucy Schwartz
Hey, you can't trust any of these girls
with like underground stuff,
but if you do your jobs and you talk in group,
they won't vote against you gettin' to see your brother.
Hey. You OK?
Yeah. I just, needed an extra pillow.
Well, I'm sure Callie wouldn't mind.
So, it's kind of silly, but,
I've been kind of scared sleeping alone since Callie left.
Do you...
Would you want sleep in here tonight?
Sure.
Oh, hey, what do you think?
For Laura?
No, for me.
We're not shopping for ourselves.
It's so boring shopping for other people.
How hot would Chase look in this hat?
Yeah, it's practically our whole budget.
And we're shopping for Laura.
Right. Laura. Which one is she again?
Have you even read the play?
Nah, I'm not into reading. Like, what's her vibe?
Um...insecure, crippled, virgin,
overbearing mother.
Oooh...that could work.
Yeah. Try it on.
Why do I have to try it on?
Come on, insecure, crippled, virgin...
Just kidding. I didn't wear any panties today, geez.
So, I'm totes having sex with Chase by opening night.
Not that he's boyfriend material, but...
You know, he's hot for a theater nerd.
Don't you think?
Yeah, I guess.
One down, how many other characters to go?
Three. You should really read the play.
Isn't there like a movie version?
I need to check your bags.
Just the shopping bags and receipts.
I don't know. I'm...
I'm so tired. And sick of everything.
Well, you've been through a lot, Becka. I'd be tired too.
Can someone else just talk?
You gotta talk about it.
Why? It sucks. I suck.
I just wanna get high.
You're gonna kill yourself with dope because you can't deal?
I don't wanna deal. OK?
I don't need to talk about how my mom's boyfriends
messed with me when I was just a kid.
Because who cares?
Where was your mom, she shouldn't have let that happen.
She was gettin' high.
Look, I started smokin' dope with my grandma when I was 11.
The only person who ever cared about me is my best friend,
and she OD'd.
I care about you.
You know, Becky, you need some life goals.
You know, honey, something to look forward to.
I mean, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Happy.
Well, that is one great goal.
Hey, how come you never share?
What do you mean?
Yeah, how old are you, what drugs have you done,
what's your addiction?
Seriously?
Yeah.
OK. Um... I'm fifty years old.
I knew you was old. Older than Michelle.
No way!
I thought you were like 30.
Really? You are now my favorite.
As for you, Daphne, hmm...
Just sayin'.
No, I'm fifty, and for drugs, not too much, you know?
When I was young I smoked a little weed.
And for like half a second, I did some speed.
Speed?
For real?
That's for real.
How'd you stop?
One day, I just decided that
doing drugs wasn't gonna get me where I wanted to go, so I quit.
Now, listen, not everybody can do that.
You ain't no addict.
I am an addict.
I'm addicted to food.
I've struggled with it my entire life.
You know, everyone is addicted to something.
Not me. I don't do drugs.
No?
You're addicted to boys!
You don't ever shut up about your boyfriends.
I haven't talked to my boyfriend since I've been here.
Well, I haven't done meth since I been here,
but that's still my addiction.
Why you always raggin' on me, Carmen?
What about Cole?
He's always sayin' he's not addicted to nothin'.
She's addicted to being a boy.
Use the pronoun "he" please.
I am a boy.
And, you know what, I belong in an LGBT home where...
"双性恋""跨性别"的缩写
And I told you, I am working on that, OK?
Be grateful you're here and
not in juvie gettin' your ass beat every day.
You may be a boy but you ain't no butch.
What about you? What's your addiction?
I've never done drugs.
I've had a couple beers.
Well, Callie, your addiction doesn't have to be drugs or alcohol.
I really...don't know.
I feel like I have to tell you that I'm addicted to something
so that I can get my privileges. But I'd just be making it up.
Why'd you run away from your foster home?
I kissed my foster brother.
Oh, snap.
La la la. Is he hot?
So, you want your privileges so you can see your boyfriend?
No. I need to see my little brother.
He needs to know why I left.
So, Jude, I just got off the phone with Rita at Girls United.
Girls United is the group home where Callie is,
and she gets to have visitors tomorrow for family day.
I'm gonna get to see her?
Yes, sir.
Can we all come?
You know, I think it best if Jude doesn't have to
share Callie just yet. OK?
Good night. The two of you don't stay up too late.
Love you.
Love you.
Are you excited?
Yeah. I mean, I can't believe it.
You know what I can't believe?
That I'm doing homework on Friday night.
I'm so overwhelmed with the play.
And, I have a book report due on Monday,
and I haven't even started reading.
Cool. Where'd you get it?
Can I borrow your lotion?
On my shelf.
So, you run out on your brother
and you think that makes you some kind of martyr?
Group's over, Becka.
You just turn on the water works
and you think you got us all fooled?
Well, not me.
You know what I think you are?
A selfish bitch.
Well, fortunately, I don't
care about the opinions of a drug addict.
Um... I'm sorry.
Get out!
Get out!
All right, Callie. Why don't you go first. What happened?
I accidentally walked in on Cole in the bathroom.
I heard yelling.
I told her to get out.
And then what happened?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Cole?
I slipped on some water and fell back into the shower door.
Wow. It was a pretty hard fall.
Pretty wet floor.
Girls, anybody see anything?
Nothing?
Well, Callie, you know, we do have a solution
when two girls don't get along here in this house.
We make them roommates.
I wasn't sure if you had to dress up.
You look very handsome.
What's wrong?
Sweetheart, listen,
it would seem that Callie has lost her privileges.
So, she's not allowed to have visitors today.
Why? What'd she do?
We're not sure.
But, there was some kind of an altercation
with another girl last night,
and Rita thinks Callie needs
a little more time to think about why she's there.
Hey, you know what?
Brandon is at piano and Mariana and Jesus are busy,
so why don't the three of us just do something fun?
We could go to a movie?
Yeah. Go biking?
The aquarium?
I... actually have a lot of homework.
I think I just want to stay here, if that's OK.
Of course.
Whatever you want, hon.
Just let us know if you change your mind.
演唱者 Anabel Englund
Guess what I found in my backpack?
Could it be a sexy, brown fedora?
You could have gotten me arrested for shoplifting!
Yeah, but I didn't
and now we have an awesome hat for Chase.
We're not keeping it.
You snuck it out, you sneak it back in.
Whoa, is that for me?
Yeah, it is.
Sweet.
You look really hot in that hat.
Totes. Mariana, you're genius.
Actually, I saw it first.
But, I carried it out of the store.
I mean, 'cause I thought it would help you create your character.
This hat is like the key to Jim.
It's like flashy, but made of felt.
You know what I mean?
Totes.
I got to go show this off.
You're welcome.
One! Two!
Three! Four!
Nicely done! Nicely done! Let's go Whales!
They let girls wrestle?
Not in my day. So, what do you think?
Doesn't seem that hard.
Really?
Jesus, you wanna come on in, give it a try?
Just pop your shoes off for me, OK?
Circle up, everybody. This is Jesus.
We are going to teach Jesus about a basic breakdown.
That is a move that takes your opponent off his or her base,
and drops them straight to the mat. OK?
Emma, why don't you come on in and take top position.
We'll do a tight waist, far ankle.
Ready?
Nice effort.
Hello? Cole, Callie,
you're welcome to join us downstairs for refreshments.
No, thanks.
Is there ice cream?
I think so. And chocolate sauce.
I'm pretty sure I saw some of that too.
Yes.
Hey, I'm really sorry you didn't get to see your brother today.
Really? Is that why you
took away my privileges for no reason?
Callie.
I didn't see what happened between you and Cole,
but I'm not stupid.
You don't get to act out and then run away from the consequences.
Not in this house.
In fact, not anywhere in life.
The sooner you learn that,
the better off you're gonna be.
Is that it?
That's it. And that's a lot.
So, think it over, all right?
I hope you come down and join us.
