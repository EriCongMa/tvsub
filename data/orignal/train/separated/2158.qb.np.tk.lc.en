five @-@ o ! hands up .
hands , hands !
hands up .
on your knees .

put your hands behind your head .
put your hands behind your head .
hey , look at me , look at me .
where &apos;s chin ho kelly ?
huh ? where is he ?
did you see that , officer ?
that &apos;s assault .
i &apos;d like to press charges .
yeah ?
what is this ?
who are you ?
she was so beautiful .
what do you want ?
guy like you has nine lives .
you lost your badge .
you got it back .
then you break the law
multiple times and you get away with it .
what are you talking about ? who are you ?
man , it feels like i haven &apos;t seen you in ages .
just five days .
not that i &apos;ve been counting .
you know , i &apos;m sorry.it &apos;s just , uh ,
you know , getting michael up to speed on
the business is taking longer than expected .
what ?
you ... you just keep apologizing
for something that i don &apos;t have a problem with .
i think it &apos;s great that michael &apos;s back in your life .
don &apos;t you ?
yeah , of course .
but it &apos;s ... it &apos;s complicated .
before michael went to prison ,
i was away at law school , and ...
you know , he was going to run our father &apos;s business .
now that we &apos;re taking things in a new direction .
michael &apos;s a little out of his comfort zone .
i think he &apos;s really lucky
to have you as his big brother .
it &apos;s the best influence he could have right now .
ah , come on .
that is the third call in a row .
yeah , i should probably get that .
listen .
really ? hmm ?
don &apos;t go anywhere .
you better hurry .
hey , i told you not to call me at this number .
i won &apos;t do such a thing .
we didn &apos;t agree to this .
where are you ?
i &apos;ll meet you in 20 .
everything all right ?
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;s just ...
business .
listen , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
rain check ?
sure .
thank you .
thank you , thank you .
okay ? i &apos;ll make it up to you .
i promise , okay ?

a burrito . you know ,
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s already a big thing .
not like this one-- i &apos;m calling it
kamekona &apos;s sunrise fusion shrimp breakfast burrito .
it &apos;s got eggs , it &apos;s got cheddar ...
pineapple salsa , shrimp ,
and a very secret special ingredient .
spam .

why do you got to be such a baby ?
try something new . expand your horizons .
my horizons are expanded plenty .
i just do not do the hawaiian mystery meat ,
you know this .
yeah , first of all ,
it doesn &apos;t come from hawaii .
oh , no ?
no . that &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t .
g.i. &apos; s brought it over in world war ii
because it was cheap , portable
and did not require refrigeration .
and it goes down smooth , thanks to the glaze .
what you think ?
that &apos;s interesting .
okay , i will have a nice ,
uh , old @-@ fashioned
breakfast burrito with eggs and bacon .
oh , no , no , no . no substitutions , no changes .
a true chef never , never compromises his culinary vision .
hey , guys .
wow ! look at that .
bringing back the &apos; 80s with the rollerblades .
you got those duran duran cassette tapes
you can lend her ?
got &apos; em .
yeah , you know , good for a workout , keeping in shape .
but i am &quot; hungry like a wolf . &quot;
that was good . that was funny .
um , you missed the tasting , luckily .
oh , that bad ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . spam wrapped in a suck .
glad i &apos;m late .
hey , where &apos;s chin ?
oh , he texted me late last night .
he , uh , said he was gonna take a few days off ,
go up to north shore .
since when does chin go on vacation ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s , uh ... he &apos;s not on vacation .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t remember this .
what ? remember what ?
he and malia &apos;s first date was eight years ago
up on the north shore .
and today &apos;s the anniversary .
all right . look , if chin wants some space ,
we &apos;ll give him some space .
yep .
attention on the cell block , watch the gates .
gates are opening .
time for chow ! line up and shut up !
step out , inmates . it &apos;s chow time .
let &apos;s go . hands by your side .
everybody step out .
look who &apos;s in lockup .
same cop who threw me in here .
inmate , slow down ! on the ground now !
i need your help .
my name is chin ho kelly .
i &apos;m with five @-@ o.
i said on the ground .
i &apos;m trying to tell you , i &apos;m a cop . something &apos;s wrong .
somebody put me in here last night .
i am not a prisoner .
come with me .
hey , charlie .
you have any luck tracing that number i called you about ?
can &apos;t say i did . i traced it ,
but the call came from a burner .
okay . i was afraid of that .
you didn &apos;t have me run that number for a case , did you ?
look ...
i came to you because we &apos;re friends ,
&apos;cause i trust you .
i &apos;m gonna need your help cloning that phone .
it &apos;s a mobile data extractor .
it has a built @-@ in sim card reader
and creates a cloned phone .
sure you want to do this ?
look , i know you weren &apos;t in this cell block last night ,
but how the hell did someone sneak you in ?
i don &apos;t know . two guys drugged me .
next thing i know , i wake up in here .
food service truck makes night deliveries .
that &apos;s the only way you could &apos;ve gotten in here .
tell me about the two guys . who are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
just get me to warden grier ,
and i &apos;ll prove i &apos;m a cop .
well , if you are , halawa &apos;s the last place you want to be .
cops that serve time in here don &apos;t do too well .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s a shortcut . it &apos;s empty .
inmates are at first meal . come on .
what are you doing ? ! open the door !
open the door !
lieutenant kelly .
kaleo .
warrick told me an old friend was sending me a surprise .
didn &apos;t expect it to be one of the dirty cops who locked me up .
you &apos;re the dirty cop .
good men died because of you .
you belong here .
i don &apos;t .
well , you &apos;re here now .
who put me in here ?
somebody who wants you to suffer before you die .
you must have been a bad boy
to end up in here , lieutenant .
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t do anything .
yeah , that &apos;s what we all say .
i heard what you told kaleo .
sounds like whoever locked you up is looking to even the score .
probably somebody you put away .
i &apos;ve been a cop a long time .
i put a lot of people away .
but i &apos;m betting ... warrick knows who &apos;s behind this .
lieutenant , whoever put you in here doesn &apos;t matter .
all that matters is , we got to get you out .
and why should i trust you ?
how about &apos; cause i just saved your sorry ass from kaleo ?
also , five @-@ o brought me to this island
and put me up in this classy joint
so i could be closer to my kid .
i owe you .
oh , and there &apos;s , uh , one more thing .
what ?
why the hell did you do that ?
the first time we met ,
you hit me across the face with an ashtray .
now that we &apos;re even , you can trust me .
we good ?
we &apos;re good .
warrick runs max security .
his keys only work in a @-@ block .
yeah ? i got to get word to a guard outside this cell block ,
let him know i &apos;m a cop .
seriously ? &apos; cause that worked out so well for you last time .
look , you don &apos;t know which guards were paid off--
not a good plan .
we keep moving this way .
all right , what &apos;s your plan ?
take the guards out of the equation .
how you gonna do that ?
bring help from the outside in .
look , what we got to do is find a phone
and get a call out to mcgarrett .
there &apos;s cons , guards and cameras everywhere .
you won &apos;t reach a phone .
besides , you &apos;re running out of time .
they &apos;ll be back from chow any minute .
starting a fire is not going to work .
that &apos;s the problem with cops-- too analytical .
you got to think outside the box .
halawa is not equipped to deal with fires
if they &apos;re big enough .
they &apos;ll have to call hfd to fight the blaze ,
and when the first responders come in ,
you tell them you &apos;re five @-@ o.
look , lieutenant , you have a better idea , speak up ,
but the way i see it , right now ,
this is the only choice you got .
so bust a move , huh ?
so , what , after i &apos;m gone ,
you &apos;re just going to go back to sitting in a cell ?
come on , brah . i know you work the angle .
why you really helping me ?
okay , truth .
five @-@ o &apos;s got the governor &apos;s ear .
i figure , i help you ,
maybe i &apos;m out in six months instead of six years .
snitches don &apos;t last long in max . you know that .
i got to get out of here .
time to send up a smoke signal , huh ?
that &apos;s smooth , baby .
hear that ?
that &apos;s the sound of freedom .
what &apos;s going on ?
uh , steve , this is dr . harriet palmer .
she &apos;s the hpd grief counselor .
she &apos;s here about chin .
hi .
commander mcgarrett , i feel terrible coming here .
i have never betrayed my patient &apos;s confidence before ,
but i &apos;m worried about chin ho .
um , chin &apos;s your patient ?
for the past few months .
i had no idea he was seeing a therapist .
he didn &apos;t want you to see his grief as a sign of weakness .
what can we do to help ?
that &apos;s the thing-- she &apos;s , uh ...
she &apos;s concerned &apos; cause chin had an appointment today
and he didn &apos;t show up .
well , chin &apos;s on the north shore .
but he called me last night to confirm his session .
i &apos;ve been trying to reach him ,
but he hasn &apos;t answered or returned my calls .
hey , chin &apos;s not on the north shore .
i just called the hotel that he usually stays at ,
and he never checked in ,
so i ping &apos;d his cell ,
and it &apos;s at his house .
hey , chin , buddy , you here ?
chin ... chin .
hey , he didn &apos;t go to the north shore .
his bike and his car are both still in the garage .
bed &apos;s unmade .
chin stayed here last night .
steve ... chin wouldn &apos;t leave anywhere
without his cell .
hey , over here !
all right , back door was open .
someone jimmied the lock , let themselves in .
i &apos;m thinking chin was asleep , two intruders come in .
one of them uses that towel to muffle the beeping keypad ,
other guy comes over here , disconnects the alarm .
and cuts the phone line
so the alarm company never gets the call .
these guys were pros .
okay , they also left his keys and his wallet .
this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
no , it wasn &apos;t a robbery .
they didn &apos;t want money ; they wanted chin .
all right , back door was opened at 10 : 43 .
chin texted me at 12 : 15 .
no , chin didn &apos;t send you anything .
it was the kidnappers who obviously sent that text .
okay , i &apos;ll call csu ,
get &apos; em down here , process this place ,
and i &apos;ll see if fong can lift a print off chin &apos;s cell .
all right .
okay , who would do this , and why send a text ?
i &apos;ll tell you why .
they knew , as soon as chin didn &apos;t show up for work ,
we would go looking for him , all right ?
they &apos;re trying to hold us off , buy some time .
time for what ?
everyone out . let &apos;s go . this is not a drill .
move it , move it , move it .
go ! let &apos;s go !
move .
that &apos;s hfd .
it &apos;s working .
like i said , sometimes you got to think outside the box .
where is he ?
come on , let &apos;s move it .
let &apos;s go . come on ,
pick it up. let &apos;s go .
hey , no inmates allowed back inside
till we get all clear .
now , back off .
so much for your smoksignals .
we got to get out of here .
only door of out here is through them .
kaleo ! kaleo !
bring it down !
hold back hfd .
lock max security down now !
i repeat , lock it down !
listen up .
this is kaleo .
we got a cop in here .
locked a lot of you up .
name &apos;s chin ho kelly .
find him .
bring him to me .
charlie , what did you find ?
whoever used chin &apos;s phone knew enough
to wipe their fingerprints ,
so i swabbed the display for trace dna .
you got something ?
yeah .
it didn &apos;t make sense . according to codis ,
the dna found on chin &apos;s cell phone
belongs to ...
frank delano ?
it &apos;s impossible .
he @-@ he &apos;s dead . chin killed him .
i know .
that &apos;s why i amplified the sample
and i &apos;m running it through codis again .
my guess is , there &apos;s a familial match .
got a hit .
paul delano ?
dob makes him the older brother .
wait a minute .
kidnapping chin has got to be payback for frank &apos;s death .
charlie , do you mind ?
according to the tsa ,
paul arrived on the island three days ago .
and there &apos;s no record of him leaving .
good , good . we &apos;ll put him on the no @-@ fly list ,
get hpd on the hunt .
all right .
hey , listen to me .
chin &apos;s a tough guy , all right ? he &apos;s gonna be okay .
we do our job ,
we find paul delano , we find chin .
come on .
okay .
there it is .
i told you , those keys
won &apos;t get us out of a @-@ block .
damn ! damn it !
i know you &apos;re out there , kelly .
you can run , but you can &apos;t hide .
why don &apos;t you do yourself a favor and come to me ?
i &apos;m gonna find you ...
sooner or later .
there &apos;s got to be another phone in this cellblock .
there is-- in the security office with kaleo .
prisoner holding . there &apos;s a public phone .
it &apos;s back the way we came .
there &apos;s 200 cons between us and that phone .
you have a price on your head .
they want me , not you .
you got a son to think about , remember ?
i &apos;ll go it alone .
look , hey , there &apos;s no cameras in here .
we can lay low .
those are bad guys out there . they will kill you .
bad guys like those
killed my wife .
i &apos;m gonna get out of here ,
or die trying .
catherine , somebody &apos;s taken chin .
oh , my god .
can you access homeland security &apos;s
video surveillance program ?
yeah , whatever you need .
i need you to monitor closed @-@ circuit video feeds
from all over the island .
and who am i looking for ?
paul delano .
what ? as in ... ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sending you his photo now .
run it through facial rec ,
let me know when you get eyes on him .
roger that .
there &apos;s a staircase off that corridor .
it takes us to holding . that &apos;s where the phone is .
over here ! there &apos;s someone in there .
no time to be a hero .
you can &apos;t be in here !
let go of me !
open it !
you hear me ? i &apos;m not going to ask you again !
open it .
i ... i can &apos;t .
i don &apos;t have the key .
where is it ?
are you all right ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m a cop .
you &apos;re the one they &apos;re looking for .
yeah .
leilani .
i &apos;m chin ho kelly .
there &apos;s a phone in holding , so , we can ...
we can call for help in there .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re heading ,
but we got to go right away , okay ?
okay .
too late , kids . holding &apos;s not an option .
kaleo &apos;s guys are all over it .
i &apos;ve got a master key .
get me to c @-@ block , and i &apos;ll get us out .
okay .
let &apos;s go .
i got a hit . i found delano .
are you sure it &apos;s him ?
it &apos;s him . facial rec confirmed it .
he &apos;s on his way out of the ilikai hotel right now .
that &apos;s two blocks from here .
that &apos;s him . get your hands up . five @-@ o.
look at me . where &apos;s chin ho kelly ?
you see that , officer ?
that &apos;s assault .
i &apos;d like to press charges .
you do that .
there &apos;s a number here you &apos;ve been calling a lot .
why don &apos;t we call &apos; em ,
see if they know where chin is ?
delano , can &apos;t talk right now .
we &apos;re in lockdown .
but it &apos;s done . kaleo will take care of kelly .
chin &apos;s in halawa prison .
this way .
that &apos;s c @-@ block there .
they &apos;re getting closer .
all right . go get the door open .
we &apos;ll try and hold &apos; em off .
come on .
good to see you again , lieutenant .
no !
i found him . the cop &apos;s down here .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s about survival .
if kaleo finds out i &apos;ve been helping you ,
we &apos;re both dead .
i knew i couldn &apos;t trust you .
back off ! back off !
bring him to kaleo alive .
go ! go !
steve .
how bad is it ?
the inmates have taken control of the maximum security .
whole place is still on lockdown .
warden &apos;s not letting anyone in .
did you find chin yet ?
surveillance tapes from earlier today prove he &apos;s inside .
we just can &apos;t get a lock where .
warden grier .
warden grier , one of my men is inside .
i just found out , commander .
we &apos;re doing everything we can ,
but i have a riot on my hands ,
and i have a protocol .
you have a protocol ?
where was your protocol
when lieutenant kelly was locked in your prison ?
guards under your supervision conspired to do this .
this happened on your watch .
what &apos;s your plan of action to get my man out of there ?
a dozen of my men are unaccounted for .
some injured , some worse .
i won &apos;t risk any more lives .
lieutenant kelly &apos;s on his own .
we &apos;re going in now .
got my bird all warmed up for you , sistah .
why &apos;s swat not taking care of business ?
they got a whole flock of choppers ready to go .
&apos;cause the warden won &apos;t let anything up in the air
over halawa till he gives the go @-@ ahead .
and we &apos;re not waiting for permission .
hey , i got 62 more payments on this girl .
be gentle , please !
you may want to step back .
you and me-- we &apos;ve had our issues .
but bringing you this cop means we &apos;re all good , you feel me ?
sure . i feel you .
lieutenant .
glad we &apos;ll be able to finish what we started .
things are different , little more painful ,
when you can &apos;t hide behind the badge and gun .
you &apos;re not better than us .
you &apos;re one of us .
you belong here .
you turned on other cops ,
locked me up .
i only survived because of one man--
frank delano .
the man you killed .
delano ...
murdered my wife .
he would &apos;ve killed my cousin
and me , too , if he had the chance .
his brother ... don &apos;t see it that way .
he put me in here .
and now you die .
kaleo !
you &apos;re making a mistake .
why do you care what happens to him ?
i don &apos;t .
i care what happens to me .
you know this guy ain &apos;t just some cop .
he &apos;s five @-@ o.
sure , you kill him , you get a few seconds of satisfaction--
but this man &apos;s your leverage .
you keep him alive a little while longer ...
you just might buy yourself a ticket out of here .
call them , kaleo .
call five @-@ o.
find out what they &apos;re willing to trade for him .
on second thought ...
why would i trust a snitch
who gave me up to five @-@ o ?
put him in a cell .
i &apos;ll deal with him later .
there &apos;s chin !
chin .
let &apos;s get out of here .
not yet .
hey , where you going ?
follow me .
this way .
leilani !
leilani !
chin ! chin !
these are my friends .
they &apos;re gonna get us out of here .
follow me .
okay , can we go now , please ?
one more .
this way .
these are the guys who took sang min .
well , where the hell is he ?
he &apos;s right here .
he &apos;s gone .
i need a trauma team on standby .
i &apos;m bringing lieutenant kelly in by helicopter .
i was wasting my time asking these amateurs .
but i know my bruddah chin , he gonna ...
he gonna let me know the truth .
what you think ?
the breakfast burrito &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a tough nut to crack , brah . um ...
maybe you stick with plate lunches for a little while , yeah ?
you know ? i think that &apos;s a ...
fantastic idea .
what do you guys know ?
you guys just don &apos;t appreciate culinary genius .
sorry . hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
no . no , of course not . come in . please .
hi . how you feeling ?
uh ... better .
thanks .
let me ask you something , sistah .
do you like spam ?
i grew up on the stuff .
you ever do any food presentation modeling ?
i could use a pretty spokeswoman .
uh , no , thank you . i already have a job .
but , um , thanks for the kind offer .
let me know .
okay , well , i think we should all get going .
give our jailbird some rest .
okay .
but before you guys go , uh ...

mahalo .
we &apos;re ohana , brah .
love you , cuz .
get some sleep .
yeah , take care , brah .
hey , anything you need , brah .
you got my back , right ?
that &apos;s right .
so , i didn &apos;t just come by to check up on you .
i wanted ...
to thank you for saving my life .
oh . well , you &apos;re welcome .
thank you .
a nail file ?
yes , well , i figured , you know , you didn &apos;t have one ;
otherwise , you would have used it .
that &apos;s good .
thank you .
hey , how &apos;s chin doing ?
doctor said he &apos;s tough .
he should be out of the hospital in a couple of days .
oh , that &apos;s great news .
yeah .
