you looked me in the eye ,
and told me that your hood was rock solid ?
you make it right on your own , or i will .
you want to settle ? let me save you some time .
we pass .
you think i don &apos;t know
this was your doing ?
daniel hardman doesn &apos;t work you . you work him .
what did hardman find in those files ?
i don &apos;t know , and i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m entitled to name one new senior partner a year .
i &apos;m naming you .
you think he &apos;s valuing you .
he &apos;s buying you .
hardman actually sees me !
you kept me waiting five years .
you can wait another 24 hours .
it &apos;s your grandma . she passed away .
no .
either jessica will retain her position ,
or i will resume control of pearson hardman .
in a few minutes , we &apos;ll know .
last time we spoke , there was a lot of talk about
peeling each other off the walls .
i just want to say--
stop talking .
as you wish .
what are you doing here ?
rachel , meet the file room .
it &apos;s where we store information
on the cases that we &apos;re working on .
no , i @-@ i just mean ,
i don &apos;t believe that harvey would
make you come and work the day after ...
you can say it .
okay , i &apos;ll say it .
the day after my grandmother died .
and harvey doesn &apos;t know .
what ? why ?
&apos;cause , there &apos;s a vote going on ,
and he &apos;s got bigger things on his mind .
mike , he &apos;d want to know .
oh , really , you know that ?
you and--you and harvey are best friends now ?
okay , then tell donna . just tell somebody that--
i don &apos;t want people to know .
if you tell people , they will understand ,
and then you can go home , and you can really deal with--
deal with what , rachel ?
the fact that i missed my last @-@ ever chance
to see my grandmother because i was too busy at work ?
oh , come on , that &apos;s not fair .
you were an amazing grandson .
you--you were buying her an apartment--
i bought her an apartment because i felt guilty
for not having seen her for two months .
no , you were buying her an apartment because--
this is not a debate , rachel .
all right , i came to work because i want to work .
i &apos;m not telling people because i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
and now i &apos;m gonna go out and get some fresh air ,
and when i get back ,
i really hope you will be done bothering me .
the managing partner ...
is daniel hardman .
effective immediately .
i want to thank you for
trusting me with the future of this firm .
i won &apos;t let you down .
let &apos;s get back to work .
harvey ... a word .
i know that we have a rocky history ,
but i would be a fool not to recognize
your value to this firm .
daniel , you won .
you don &apos;t need to blow smoke up my ass .
i &apos;m not blowing smoke .
i told you this from the day i came back ,
that i was us to find a way to work together .
why say this to me and not jessica ?
i will .
but her name is on the door .
she &apos;s not going anywhere .
i want to make sure that you &apos;re not going anywhere either .
it &apos;s time to go .
i can name 12 partners who will follow you anywhere .
we can have every associate in the place .
harvey ...
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
不得加入和公司有直接竞争关系的公司
we have a non @-@ compete clause .
we quit , we can &apos;t practice law in new york for a year .
contracts were made to be broken .
not when they &apos;re written by me .
well , maybe we should take a year off .
how would that go ?
you could teach .
i could also kill myself .
you could write a book .
next .
what about travel ?
you have the means .
see the world .
teaching , writing , traveling .
you know what you &apos;re talking about ?
running .
i &apos;m not running .
we can &apos;t stay here . not working for him .
yes , we can .
we are going to swallow our pride ,
and we &apos;re going to wait
until we can make a move from a position of strength .
that &apos;s your tactic ?
holding your head down and waiting ?
that &apos;s what he did .
it took him five years .
do you really think it &apos;s gonna
take him five years to screw up again ?
i bet it &apos;ll be more like five minutes .
jessica--
that &apos;s enough .
this happened today . today .
we just took the hit .
we suffered a loss ,
and you don &apos;t make major life decisions
when you &apos;re reeling from a loss .
i wanna buy some weed .
sorry , man , you got it wrong , but , uh ,
hey , if you want a paper , i &apos;ll be--
i &apos;m not a cop , okay ?
i know for a fact that you &apos;re a dealer .
i &apos;ve seen you here every single day .
i know the drill .
a guy comes up , he hands you a $ 100 bill ,
he walks away with a folded newspaper full of weed .
well , i have money .
if you don &apos;t want it , i &apos;ll be happy to take it
to the coffee cart down at 50th and lex
who we both know is your competition .
have a great day .
yeah .
don &apos;t you dare touch his balls .
what the hell ?
these bozos walked in here right after the vote .
we &apos;re moving to the 46th floor .
you and paul porter are switching .
hardman .
bowties have no place here !
all that bullshit about working together ?
you forgot to mention
that it was down on the 46th floor .
it &apos;s just four walls , harvey .
yeah , so is a prison cell ,
which is where you send people to be punished .
paul porter was loyal to me
long before we were pearson hardman .
i reward people who are loyal to me .
show me you are one of those people .
it &apos;s one thing to become king of the hill .
it &apos;s another to stay there .
accept this with grace , harvey .
you want grace ?
i &apos;ll give you the courtesy you never gave me .
i &apos;ll say it to your face .
i &apos;m coming for you .
what were you doing in there ? kissing the ring ?
don &apos;t try to weasel your way in with another managing partner .
that job &apos;s already taken .
daniel , you wanted to see me .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
louis , this firm has been through a divisive fight ,
of which you were victorious .
we were victorious .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a victory
unless we &apos;re united moving forward .
that is so true .
jessica &apos;s a class act .
she &apos;ll take the defeat in stride . she &apos;s not the problem .
what do you need ?
you made me senior partner . i always pay my debts .
i &apos;m a lannister .
the problem is her pitbull .
well , harvey can be polarizing .
but i can &apos;t just fire him . he &apos;s a senior partner .
uh , i &apos;m sorry , fire him ?
do you have a problem with that ?
louis , he just came in here and announced
he &apos;s putting a target on my back .
you voted for me . that means there &apos;s a target on your back too .
tell me what to do .
you have to stop doing that .
well , you weren &apos;t at your desk ,
so i figured you and your small bladder would be here .
these cases , they &apos;re a priority .
fine .
do you know what that means ?
yes , i know what the word priority means .
well , you &apos;re gonna get them done
before you even consider doing anything for harvey .
you don &apos;t get him a file , you don &apos;t bring him a coffee ,
you don &apos;t buy him his hair gel--
that &apos;s not what i do for him .
right , like he buys his own hair gel .
doesn &apos;t matter .
you don &apos;t do anything for him now .
you &apos;re just like everyone else .
you belong to me .
i don &apos;t belong to anyone .
well , then quit .
your days are numbered here anyway .
you don &apos;t get this shit done , i &apos;m gonna fire you myself .
it &apos;s either me or the movers ,
and at least i know where my hands have been .
i need more packing tape .
oh , it &apos;s right over there .
i know .
wow , there &apos;s a first for everything .
the mighty donna , nothing to say .
trouble in paradise ?
louis , get out .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
okay , listen ...
i &apos;ve , uh , been asked to redistribute the workload .
jessica focused too much on the flash .
these cases won &apos;t make the new york times ,
but they &apos;ll definitely bankroll our bonuses .
it &apos;s an employee retirement income security act case .
you know what that means ?
i know what erisa is , louis .
oh , good , so you won &apos;t mind the detail @-@ oriented nature
of the assignment .
i won &apos;t mind it at all .
great . by the way , harvey ,
if you &apos;re planning on pawning this off to mike ,
well , you can &apos;t .
mike &apos;s focus has been too , um ... harvey @-@ centric ,
so i assigned our resident wunderkind
some cases of his own .
auf wiedersehen .
you look overwhelmed . let me help .
forget that . you &apos;re gonna do this instead .
louis said i &apos;m not allowed to prioritize your work anymore .
you think i &apos;m taking orders from louis now ?
consider things status quo .
yeah , well , they aren &apos;t .
they are as far as you and i are concerned .
i give you work , and you &apos;re gonna do it .
oh , right , i forgot .
that &apos;s how it works with us .
don &apos;t pout . you &apos;re gonna love this case .
it &apos;s very detail @-@ oriented .
and what are you doing ?
operation &quot; right the ship . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s time that you just accept that it &apos;s over .
you lost . deal with it .
excuse me ?
you seem to live in this deluded world
where you think that you can always win .
but sometimes you can &apos;t .
bad things happen .
you have to face the fact that life is gonna be
this case or this case or this case !
jessica lost ! you lost !
and there isn &apos;t anything that any of us ,
including the great and powerful harvey specter , can do about it .
go home .
now .
yeah ?
okay , you &apos;re clearly not ready to go .
what ? come on , the funeral doesn &apos;t start for another--
oh , shit !
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
uh , can i wear this ?
here , drink this .
okay .
you &apos;re gonna get in the shower ,
and i &apos;m gonna find you something to wear , okay ?
okay .
mike ?
yeah ?
is this a great idea ?
rachel , it &apos;s one night , okay ?
please , take it easy on me .
it--it looks like more than one night .
you &apos;re right .
thanks , rachel . i &apos;ll be out in five , okay ?
okay .
donna .
donna .
donna !
i &apos;m sorry , but apparently paul porter
doesn &apos;t believe in technology .
look , i need the employment survey .
yeah , i &apos;m working on it .
it &apos;s not done ?
it &apos;s a survey of all 50 states .
you gotta get on this .
mike could have done it in his sleep .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a photographic memory ,
but my brain is already too busy being awesome .
well , what about one of the other associates ?
which one ?
you know .
do i ?
the blonde one .
oh , of course .
then the brunette .
male ? female ?
yes .
you don &apos;t know a single one of their names , do you ?
mike ross .
do i need to remind you
that you &apos;re the one who sent him home yesterday ?
i thought he would come back .
you know , you could call him , harvey .
just get me anyone .
what ?
no one &apos;s available .
why not ?
no one &apos;s available ... to you .
louis .
he &apos;s trying to bait me .
what are you gonna do about it ?
nothing .
today is not the day he &apos;s gonna see me sweat .
mike , i &apos;m sorry , but ... it &apos;s time .
i can &apos;t . i just ...
look , i know it &apos;s hard ,
but if you don &apos;t go up there and say something , there ...
there &apos;s just no one else .
there &apos;s no--
none of these people even know her .
you &apos;re not speaking for them .
you &apos;re speaking for you .
everyone is gone .
not everyone .
tess ?
mike .
how did you--
my mom .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
he doesn &apos;t want to speak .
i can &apos;t .
you can .
what &apos;s your name ?
rachel .
mike ,
rachel and i are gonna be right here .
you can do this .
i promise , you &apos;re gonna feel so much better after .
or you &apos;ll feel a hundred times worse .
either way , you gotta do it .
okay .
i , uh ... remember things .
i remember the night that my parents were taken away from me .
i remember my grandmother taking me in .
she came to check on me .
it was , uh ...
it was the middle of the night , and ...
i had wet the bed .
and she cleaned the sheets ,
and she--she cleaned me all up ,
and she put me in her bed , and , uh ...
you know , i ... started to cry .
really hard , and , uh ...
and she said , &quot; it &apos;s okay , michael . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ve been crying too . &quot;
&quot; but don &apos;t you wet this bed ,
because i have to sleep here too . &quot;
and , uh ...
you know , we laughed , you know ?
in spite of everything , we laughed , and ...
and we kept laughing .
we kept laughing until i fell asleep .
when i woke up the next morning ,
she wasn &apos;t just my grandmother anymore .
she was ...
she was my whole family .
well , i &apos;m not 11 years old anymore .
i &apos;m not gonna wet the bed tonight .
but i will remember ...
that night .
and everything she has ever done for me .
for the rest of my life .
you were great .
thanks .
she &apos;s right .
i &apos;m tess , by the way .
oh , it &apos;s good to meet you , tess .
good to meet you , rachel .
are you two ...
no , no . we work together .
i assume you knew edith ?
grammy was the best part about being friends with this guy .
oh , you called her grammy too ?
oh , everybody did .
so you guys must go way back .
short story is , we &apos;ve known each other since we were seven .
long story is , you dated each other .
mm , i don &apos;t think we need to get into the long story .
we shared a few milestones together .
first beer ,
prom , sex ...
and there &apos;s the long story .
well , i don &apos;t know about you two ,
but i think we should get drunk .
i wish , but i have to go pack up her room .
i have to get back to the office ,
and i do not want to see you there later today , okay ?
thanks , rachel .
yeah , of course .
let me know if you need anything , just call me .
really good to meet you .
you too .
doth my eyes deceive me ?
it appears that you &apos;re actually doing the task
that you &apos;ve been assigned .
doth you want to kiss my ass ?
i sense frustration .
case too much ?
can &apos;t handle all those numbers ?
louis , just because financial cases bore me
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t do them in my sleep .
well , did you remember to do this ?
i didn &apos;t have to , because i did that .
well , that means that you have to--
replace the custodian ,
have an alternate , show precedence ,
generate cash flow projections ,
and have everything audited by an experienced fiduciary ?
impressive .
well , i &apos;ll review these for court , 4 : 00 p.m. , today ,
where you will be my second chair .
did i forget to mention that ?
my bad .
oh , and if you want to pick up some coffee ,
i take mine with cream and stevia .
would you like me to put that in your calendar ?
i will take that as a &quot; no . &quot;
she loved you , you know ?
pretty sure she never got over our breakup .
well , that &apos;s because she knew you would never do better .
what &apos;s going on ?
i cancelled on her the night before she died .
you must feel awful .
i was working .
i don &apos;t even remember what for .
and we &apos;re talking about me here .
i just know it seemed so important at the time ,
and now ...
i didn &apos;t even get to say good @-@ bye to her .
but ...
never really get to say good @-@ bye to anyone , do i ?
the , uh ...
the night before i went to college ,
i was supposed to see you , and i couldn &apos;t .
yeah . yeah , you were having dinner with your family .
yeah .
&quot; dinner with my family &quot; was me sobbing in my bed .
we had said we &apos;d break up at the end of the summer , but ...
i knew if i showed up ,
i never would have been able to do it .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
i didn &apos;t have the guts to say good @-@ bye .
it &apos;s okay .
mike ...
i &apos;m married .
you ...
are you kidding me ?
mike ...
get out .
right .
go .
okay .
when i sent you home ,
i didn &apos;t mean for you to never come back .
my grandmother died .
i know .
look , you obviously weren &apos;t ready to deal with it ,
so i respected that by keeping you busy .
was i wrong ?
no .
are you stoned ?
yep .
and i &apos;m not interested in a lecture , so--
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m not interested in giving one .
yeah , help yourself .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
is this the coffee cart guy ?
look , donna , for the record ,
i am sorry that you got caught in this crossfire .
and no matter what happens with--
there will always be a place here for you .
with you ?
yeah . yes .
it would be my honor .
you really don &apos;t get it , do you ?
harvey and i are like this .
you think i would leave him for anybody ,
let alone somebody who did what you did ?
you betrayed your team .
harvey and jessica were not my team .
yes , they were .
and i was . but no one is anymore .
and i might not like moving ,
but the one thing that i love about it
is that it is further away from your smug face .
the whole bag ?
how do you even do that , man ?
it &apos;s like--i &apos;ve got , like , crazy cotton mouth right now .
harvey specter doesn &apos;t get cotton &quot; mouff . &quot;
cotton &quot; mouff &quot; ?
mouff .
i guess harvey specter does get cotton &quot; mouff . &quot;
i can &apos;t help it , these pretzels ...
are making me thirsty !
here , drink this , rookie .
oh , my god , i--
did you ever hear of a hanger ?
oh , god , wow !
i just got an image of you as a dad .
with , like , a little harvey specter , you know ,
all hair @-@ gelled , and , like ,
pinstripe oshkosh b &apos;gosh .
&quot; dad , don &apos;t play the odds , play the man . it &apos;s--it &apos;s a win @-@ win . &quot;
you being like , &quot; go to your goddamn room . &quot;
oh , look at this .
you bought an apartment in manhattan .
i got it for her .
i always hated the word &quot; orphan . &quot;
i mean , i just-- i never felt like one .
until now .
i ever tell you about my dad ?
i think you know the answer to that question .
he was a saxophone player .
he sat in with everybody because everybody loved him .
he believed in love at first sight ,
and unfortunately ...
his first sight was a groupie .
your mother .
i was 16 when i caught her cheating .
i knew if i told my dad he &apos;d--
next two years went by , i didn &apos;t say a thing ,
and she went right on just ...
making him a fool .
look , this is all to say that ,
i lived in a house surrounded by family ,
but i know what it &apos;s like to be totally alone .
your stoned is depressing .
you should never share your feelings ever again .
i mean , not with me .
i gotta say , it &apos;s been a tough week for both of us .
hardman .
oh , what i wouldn &apos;t give to piss in that bastard &apos;s office .
that was pretty quick off the tongue .
well , i &apos;ve done it before .
to louis .
no way .
way .
wait a minute .
if you &apos;ve done that before--
why not do it again ?
okay . let &apos;s go .
no , no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s not right .
it &apos;s not right ?
i drank three gatorades on the way here .
i &apos;m gonna pee orange . it &apos;s right .
no .
what ?
if we &apos;re gonna do something ,
it needs to be original .
orange .
no--
you know what ?
i know what we &apos;re gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna get the can opener .
are you serious right now ? you &apos;re not messing with me ?
you &apos;re finally gonna tell me
what you do with that can opener ?
do i look serious ?
you look stoned .
i am , but i never joke about the can opener .
come on .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
all right , go .
all right ...
what we do is--
okay , if you were a narcissist with great hair ,
what would your password be ?
harvey .
specter .
no , that &apos;s just way too easy .
one of his favorite basketball players .
shaquille o &apos;bryant ?
i still don &apos;t understand the thumbtack thing .
surprising , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
hey , say what you will about this floor ,
i &apos;m pretty sure the cubicles are bigger .
hey , what &apos;s going on ? how you guys doing ?
i was just , uh , helping box a little bit ,
&apos;cause , uh , donna was feeling a little blue about moving .
what the hell are you doing ?
harvey . harvey !
you looking for another way to make my life miserable ?
harvey ! harvey , no !
come on . you hit him , they win .
should &apos;ve let me hit him .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that ,
but maybe we shouldn &apos;t have let him leave .
why ?
maybe he wasn &apos;t snooping .
maybe he was , i don &apos;t know , trying to plant something ,
like--like drugs .
in my record collection ?
what better place to stash
the weed than with the bob marley , man ?
louis doesn &apos;t even know where to buy drugs ,
let alone plant them .
i know where to buy drugs .
congratulations .
no , i &apos;m serious . what if instead of peeing ,
we planted something in hardman &apos;s office .
genius !
it &apos;s a crime .
maybe .
but he wouldn &apos;t hesitate for one second
to do the same thing to get rid of you .
what ?
he wouldn &apos;t hesitate to plant something to get rid of me .
what , louis ?
no , hardman .
i just said that .
no .
what if hardman planted
the cm memo in the first place ?
donna never saw the memo .
donna never makes mistakes .
what if she never saw it four years ago because it wasn &apos;t there ?
and then it was .
you really think he had the balls to walk into that file room ,
open a box , and plant a document ?
there &apos;s no security cameras and no locks on the doors .
fine , but how did he get the document in the first place ?
hardman brought coastal motors into the firm .
yeah , but he wasn &apos;t here when the case went to trial .
no , not the trial , the defect .
what &apos;s the date sarah layton left cm ?
there .
hardman was still here .
makes sense .
sarah layton confronts kemp .
he panics . who &apos;s the first person he calls ?
his lawyer .
hardman tells him to bury it .
that &apos;s a crime .
you said yourself he wouldn &apos;t hesitate to commit a crime .
he knew the cars were bad from the beginning .
what ?
when hardman came back , the first thing he did
was ask louis for a report on every case at the firm .
yeah , he was looking for weaknesses .
he knew the cm win was based on a lie ,
made it look like it was my lie .
which brings us to ?
tanner .
hardman couldn &apos;t bring the suit himself .
he needed an executioner .
and he picked tanner .
so when i suspected something was fishy ,
i &apos;d focus on tanner , not him .
they were in on it together .
i went through every box that hardman looked at , to find dirt on tanner .
there was no dirt .
you need to call a partner meeting .
i &apos;ll call for it ...
five minutes after you get me some proof .
sorry , harvey . pilates is on wednesdays .
you and i are gonna go .
and when we &apos;re done ,
you &apos;re gonna admit to me what you did .
i &apos;ve done a lot of things , harvey .
well , i want to know why you settled .
you know damn well why i settled .
no , i don &apos;t .
i want to know about you and hardman ,
and you &apos;re gonna answer my questions ,
or i &apos;m gonna kick your ass .
i &apos;m not doing the one , and you can &apos;t do the other .
i can , and you will .
all right , let &apos;s go .
as long as it takes .
i win , you talk ?
you lose , i don &apos;t .
why &apos;d you settle ?
i decline to answer .
why &apos;d you settle ?
i decline to answer .
you get one question .
well , let &apos;s see .
how about , why &apos;d you settle ?
because that memo was a fraud .
what ? you need to come forward--
no , no , no , no , no . i said one question , harvey .
one question .
my god .
we were right .
right about what ?
i found it .
you found what ?
i found it !
no , no .
it can &apos;t be-- it can &apos;t be like this .
why ?
because your grandmother just died .
you think not kissing is going to make that any better ?
no , no , i think that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s gonna do ,
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s a problem .
rachel , in the middle of the worst week ever ,
i have found a moment of something good .
now , ple--
i know .
but when something like that happens ,
people don &apos;t make smart choices .
yeah .
no , you &apos;re right .
but being smart ...
hasn &apos;t made either one of us very happy .
daniel .
louis .
i have something that may be of interest .
already ?
i &apos;m notoriously fast .
i have certain suspicions .
all i need you to do is authorize action .
you really think he does ?
i really think he did .
i am impressed .
you &apos;d be surprised what i can do
now that i have the proper motivation .
you &apos;re banned on this floor .
that &apos;s funny .
it &apos;s pee in a cup time .
drug tests are for associates , not the partners .
yeah , well hardman believes in running a real clean ship .
you know , like &quot; just say no . crack is whack . &quot;
which is why a new policy went into effect as of this morning .
you know , i don &apos;t smell it on you now ,
but i sure as hell did last night
when you manhandled me in your office .
i &apos;m sure you had a lot of fun laughing at that one .
you want to take it , you &apos;re gonna have to take it forcibly .
refusal to take this test
gives me grounds to fire you for cause .
i refuse .
you &apos;re fired .
per our bylaws , i &apos;m entitled to a hearing in front of
a quorum of our senior partners , and i &apos;m on record .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
just take the test .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
it &apos;s just a drug--
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you were the one who told me to take it easy .
and you and i both know what we did that night
in this very office .
that was a celebration . this is different , th--
when did this happen ?
does it matter when ?
i don &apos;t believe it .
you were high when you came up with that theory .
doesn &apos;t matter how we got there , we got there .
i bought us some time .
we can use the review to present our case .
do you have any evidence ?
not only did he plant the document ,
he wrote the damn thing .
how do you know that ?
tanner ... indicated that to me .
turns out , they weren &apos;t in on it together .
huh . and he &apos;s willing to testify to that .
oh , let me guess . no , he won &apos;t .
i &apos;ve got mike chasing down another avenue .
jessica , i don &apos;t do this now , i &apos;m gone anyway .
what is it ?
daniel and louis got their quorum .
your review convenes in an hour .
pursuant to new york civil code ,
a settlement based on fraudulent representation
can be voided by the court .
who are you ?
my name &apos;s mike ross . i work for harvey specter .
get off my car .
ss far as we can tell , there were only two people
who knew about the problems with the cm hood .
sarah layton , and you .
but i think there was a third .
you know , last time i was ambushed in this garage ,
i gave in . not this time .
you met with daniel hardman
the night before sarah layton &apos;s last day .
we have his calendar .
what do you want ?
i want you to sign this affidavit stating
you told daniel hardman about the problems with the hood ,
and that he advised you to bury those problems
and cut a deal with sarah layton .
harvey came to me ,
told me to settle , and then we &apos;d be done .
now you &apos;re threatening me ,
telling me to put it in writing , and then we &apos;ll be done .
sorry , junior .
we are done .
that kid better get here fast .
he &apos;ll come through .
harvey specter has refused to take a mandatory drug test ,
leaving me no choice but to terminate his employment .
as is his right ,
he has requested a hearing to dispute this .
thank you , daniel ,
but i &apos;m not here to dispute anything .
after all , i was high .
i was high because i was being forced to work for you .
a man who , it turns out , knew cm was negligent
before i ever even took the case .
uh , this is not the time--
shut up , louis .
don &apos;t do this .
if you go , i go .
do you deny knowing about the defects ?
unequivocally .
and you deny writing this memo ,
sending it to tanner ,
knowing that he would come after this entire firm ?
that &apos;s why he settled .
because you told him it wouldn &apos;t hold up .
that &apos;s wild conjecture ,
and it &apos;s bullshit .
why &apos;d he settle ?
he settled because i did what i do .
that is not an answer .
yes . it is .
this ends here .
the two of you have now slandered me ,
which violates the morality clause of the partners &apos; agreement .
it &apos;s not slander if it &apos;s the truth .
unfortunately , you don &apos;t have a shred of evidence ,
because the evidence doesn &apos;t exist .
well , actually , it does .
this is a partners @-@ only meeting .
so have tanner sue me .
but in the meantime ,
i think the rest of the partners are gonna want to see this .
it &apos;s a signed affidavit from lawrence kemp ,
stating that he told daniel hardman about the defects
in the cm hood six years ago .
may 7th was the date of that meeting ,
per your calendar , to be exact .
you just denied knowing anything about that ,
unequivocally .
i guess you were just lying to cover up the fact
that you were behind this entire suit in the first place .
is that the basis of this ?
a coerced lie from a man trying to say ,
&quot; my lawyer made me do it . &quot;
no way that holds up in court .
it doesn &apos;t have to .
it just has to make these
harvard @-@ educated lawyers understand
that you made each and every one of them
spend $ 100,000 of their own money
to buy you control of my firm .
i think we &apos;ve heard all we needed to hear .
harvey has admitted to violating the drug policy .
all those in favor of his dismissal ?
looks like you lost .
i &apos;m glad you brought up the bylaws .
fraudulently suing your own firm is grounds for firing .
you have no proof of that .
all those in favor of daniel hardman &apos;s dismissal ?
hey , harvey , i know i &apos;m not a partner ,
but do you mind ?
go ahead .
nice .
daniel , that $ 3 million of our money
you spent on yourself .
consider your partnership bought out .
what was really on that affidavit , anyway ?
what i said was on it .
you realize it &apos;s a felony to sign someone else &apos;s name
to a sworn document .
i didn &apos;t sign someone else &apos;s name .
i signed my own name .
i mean , seriously ,
how often do you really look at a man &apos;s shoes ?
to the firm of pearson and kiss my ass .
i told you we &apos;d be peeling him off the wall .
you go , i go .
he goes .
i already went and came back .
资深合伙人
you &apos;re married .
i am .
you called me anyway .
i did .
so we &apos;re clear ...
i don &apos;t consider anything bought out .
too bad .
&apos;cause the only way you &apos;re getting another penny is through litigation .
we may not have proof now , but we will .
if this comes out at trial , you &apos;ll never practice again .
sign this confidentiality agreement .
i &apos;ll waive my claim .
one time offer . take it or leave it .
for the record , i wasn &apos;t the one who made the first move .
harvey was .
yeah , you made your first move five years ago .
maybe . but someday ...
he &apos;ll make the first move on you .
good @-@ bye , daniel .
are you gonna throw something at me ?
i &apos;ll go .
but don &apos;t kid yourself that this is the last page of the story .
give me your toes .
no .
oh , just like riding a bike .
oh , okay .
i should be more upset that you just compared me to a bike ,
but i love bikes .
pizza .
okay .
pepperoni .
is this a bad time to tell you that i &apos;m a vegan ?
um , no .
more pizza for me .
you were right .
i don &apos;t care about being smart .
