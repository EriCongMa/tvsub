a good friend of mine , sheriff peter coleman ,
down in briscoe county , texas ,
reached out to me about a possible case .
the same unsub killed one john and two prostitutes .
if you can &apos;t make sure my bitches are safe ,
then what good are you ?
because before he was justin mills ,
he was gordon borell ,
and he was arrested for cutting one of the ladies he employed .
but you said the unsub wanted us to catch him and punish him .
what he really wanted was for us to catch the preacher .
we need to tell him we know he didn &apos;t do this .
oh , preacher , what have you gotten yourself into ?
shots fired ! shots fired !
blake !
reid !
we need a medic now !
there &apos;s too much blood !
hey , you &apos;re doing great , all right ?
yeah . you gotta stay right here , ok ?
eyes on me . eyes on me .
no , no . no .
ethan ? ethan !
open your eyes .
hurry !
hurry !
suspect is down . repeat , suspect is down .
we got this covered .
one of yours is in bad shape .
let &apos;s go .
copy that . two of ours , 3 of theirs .
any casualties ?
one . coleman .
coleman ?
and what about reid ?
not good . they &apos;re taking him to the hospital .
i &apos;ll call you back .
all right , derek , you should go get that looked at .
we &apos;ll meet you there .
fastest route to the hospital is highway 17 .
thanks .
the sound is like a teakettle .
do you hear it ?
what ?
reid .
pressure &apos;s dropping .
pulse is thready . starting large @-@ bore i.v.
reid !
agent , you &apos;ve got to sit back .
you gotta help him , man .
kid , come on , now .
stay with me . i &apos;m right here .
reid .
reid !
stay with me .
demons
&quot; when truth is buried , it grows .
it chokes . it gathers such an explosive force
that on the day it bursts out ,
it blows up everything with it . &quot;
emile zola .
anything yet ?
no .
spence would have read like two books by now .
maybe 3 .
it should have been me .
or me or any of us .
no .
he pushed me out of the way .
if he doesn &apos;t make it .
he &apos;ll make it .
he has to .
he &apos;s just--he &apos;s too young .
yeah , there &apos;s still things for him to do .
you know , he wants kids .
can you imagine spence as a dad ?
that &apos;d be the luckiest kid in the world .
no doubt .
you made it .
yeah , it turns out we &apos;re not the only one that &apos;s connected
and he knows somebody with a plane .
how is he ?
still in surgery .
you all can see agent morgan now .
well , if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d really like to stay here .
the second you hear anything , call me .
i &apos;ll be right back .
how &apos;s reid ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
no ! what are you doing ?
you can bet your ass i &apos;m not gonna just sit around here .
guys , come on , get me out of here .
actually , you are . just hang on a second .
just until we figure out what &apos;s what .
catch me up .
the 3 victims inside were dead before the shooting started .
lividity had set in and there was no blood spatter .
they weren &apos;t killed there .
the preacher &apos;s car was clean ,
so there &apos;s no way he transported bodies in it .
so you were right .
he was being framed . but by whom ?
the answer &apos;s in the victims .
belinda clark and jesse moore
were both tied to prostitution like the others .
travis henson was a regular at the pool hall ,
but he didn &apos;t work there .
see , i don &apos;t get why the preacher
didn &apos;t just come clean with you .
he was a narcissistic sociopath who was cornered ,
but he still thought that he could get away with it .
once he started shooting , he made his decision .
coming clean was no longer an option .
guys , i don &apos;t think he was the first one to shoot .
whoever set him up was there .
that &apos;s ballsy . what makes you think that ?
because i &apos;m pretty sure
that reid and i heard the first shots fired .
we were all outside of that diner .
anybody got any photos ?
yeah . i downloaded the crime scene photos .
all right , show me coleman .
right here .
where &apos;s my vest ? i want to show you something .
all right .
you see these ?
that &apos;s from a mac @-@ 10 .
now look at this .
you see how the impact mushrooms out ?
that &apos;s from a semi @-@ jacketed hydra @-@ shok round .
it makes a high @-@ pitched scream .
and i know that i heard it .
that &apos;s law enforcement issue .
friendly fire ?
no . all those cops were shooting into the diner .
the round came from the same direction as the preacher .
ok , i don &apos;t know who shot first ,
but i do know that every victim &apos;s connected to the pool hall .
the only one missing is dinah .
go find her .
what are you doing , dinah ?
come on , owen .
just let me be .
i &apos;m not stubborn like the preacher .
i won &apos;t give you any trouble .
you know i ain &apos;t gonna say nothin &apos; .
oh , i know you better not .
please .
owen , i won &apos;t tell anyone .
i swear .
let &apos;s go . come on .
ok . ok , ok , ok .
move it .
agent .
how is he ?
incredibly lucky .
two millimeters to the right
and the bullet would have torn through the carotid artery .
it nicked some smaller vessels ,
but we &apos;ve stopped the bleeding .
you can see him now .
hey , how is he ?
great .
thanks , alex .
bye .
spence is in recovery .
good .
the kid &apos;s too smart to die .
probably rerouted the bullets by power of suggestion .
i was scared .
yeah , i was , too .
well , it looks like she packed a few things
before someone forced their way in here .
truck &apos;s still out front .
she strike you as the mothering type ?
well , if you pay her for it . why ?
she has this framed .
it was in the bottom of her bag ,
so that probably means it was one of the first things she packed .
it must be very important to her .
yeah , hotch . she &apos;s gone ,
but it doesn &apos;t look like she went willingly .
no , she didn &apos;t .
meet us at the station .
right .
where did you guys find her ?
trying to get out of town .
deputy mcgregor found her flying down route 13 .
when he pulled her over , she resisted arrest .
i &apos;d like to talk to deputy mcgregor .
well , he &apos;s back out there . what do you need to know ?
what was she driving ?
he didn &apos;t say . her truck , i presume . why ?
just curious .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter much .
it looks like we got her now .
she &apos;s gotta be behind all this .
probably got tired of the preacher controlling her
and pulled a power play .
i &apos;m sure you guys have a proper word
for that kind of behavior .
devious .
excuse me , folks .
dinah &apos;s truck was still at her place .
we need to talk to her .
happy to do it .
hi , dinah .
sometimes investigators suffer from a form of tunnel vision .
especially when one of their own gets killed .
they stop asking questions
and start to frame the case around their theory .
do you know what they think ?
they think that you did all of it ,
not just the preacher , but the sheriff
and all of the girls , too .
but here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t think you wanted those girls to die .
and you were scared for those girls .
because you were one of them .
weren &apos;t you ?
dinah , you can tell me whatever it is you are afraid of .
i will protect you .
you can protect me ?
we have federal jurisdiction .
who was the little boy in the picture frame ?
he &apos;s like 7 years old ?
you &apos;re wasting your time .
i got nothin &apos; to say to you .
with all due respect , agent ,
she &apos;s here under resisting arrest charges ,
and my guess is there &apos;s a hell of a lot more that &apos;ll stick .
see ? tunnel vision .
the thing about tunnels--
they can get real dark real fast .
i &apos;m gonna take care of my case now .
so if you don &apos;t mind ...
well , she &apos;s definitely afraid ,
but got defiant when bennett walked in .
you get anything about the kid ?
nothing but a look of desperation .
if she has someone to lose ,
they hold all the cards .
outside .
so garcia did some digging
and it turns out that travis henson ,
the third victim from the diner ,
was also a confidential informant .
for coleman ?
no .
for a decorated deputy named owen mcgregor .
you mean the same deputy who arrested dinah
but didn &apos;t stick around to book her ?
it explains the hydra @-@ shok rounds found in coleman
and why all the victims were afraid .
each one reported &quot; they &quot; were gonna get them .
what if &quot; they &quot; is more than just this owen mcgregor ?
what if it &apos;s the whole force ?
i &apos;m telling you , coleman was not a dirty cop .
no , but he &apos;s only been sheriff for a year .
so he &apos;s the outsider . that &apos;s what got him killed .
it &apos;s a massive body count . what the hell are they protecting ?
a way of life ?
corruption like this can make a lot of people a lot of money .
and you never met this mcgregor ?
he &apos;d just finished his 4 / 40 when we landed .
convenient .
he &apos;s back on the clock now .
where would he go ?
bad news . that agent &apos;s gonna make it .
you need my help ?
no .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
it &apos;ll be so great if he wakes up ...
and this is the first thing he sees .
yeah .
the good doctor will always make him smile .
it &apos;d be really great if he wakes up
and we &apos;re all--ooh-- staring at him .
so , i &apos;m gonna go stand over here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
trust no one , my friend .
why ?
corruption .
something this organized needs a strong leader .
we think it &apos;s deputy owen mcgregor .
and there &apos;s a second @-@ in @-@ command who appears trustworthy
but has the access and the skill set to do a lot of damage .
deputy bennett is presenting as that .
they framed the preacher and dinah .
she &apos;s still alive and terrified .
she ran the prostitution ring with the preacher ,
but she must play a bigger part in the rest of this .
she &apos;s clearly worth more alive than dead .
for now .
we could offer her something ,
get her to trust us .
we &apos;ve seen this before .
we find her kid and maybe she &apos;ll talk .
let &apos;s see if garcia can find him .
the rest of us need to figure out who else is involved .
hey , garcia .
hi . i found juice , broth , and jell @-@ o .
super bland , but he needs the calories .
when this comes off , i &apos;m gonna look just like boris karloff .
yeah . a little green makeup
and you &apos;ll have the best halloween costume ever .
everybody &apos;s fine . don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not .
you &apos;ve got that furrowed brow .
will you look who &apos;s still awake .
can you tell her she can go now , please ?
i &apos;m ok , alex . go help the team .
all right . i &apos;m out of here .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re awake .
thank you .
juice , broth , or jell @-@ o !
jell @-@ o , my favorite .
you guys were out there a long time .
anything we should know about ?
just getting some fresh air .
dinah didn &apos;t claim any dependents
when she filed her tax returns .
bonus points for checking in with uncle sam .
at least that part of her life &apos;s in order .
she &apos;s from around here . mom lives 10 miles away .
this is weird .
her mom has a first @-@ grader enrolled at buckingham elementary .
what are the chances a 78 @-@ year old
has a first @-@ grader ?
what &apos;s his name ?
josh .
i &apos;m sending all the information out .
all right , thanks , garcia .
eat that .
so garcia tracked down dinah &apos;s son ,
who &apos;s living close to here , but , um ,
i &apos;ve got eyes all over me , so someone else should go .
how &apos;s dr. reid ?
he &apos;s awake . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
that &apos;s good to hear .
what &apos;s wrong ?
let &apos;s take a car ride . i &apos;ll fill you in .
jj , send us the info .
will do .
we knew coleman had only been here a year ,
but get this .
he replaced a sheriff who also died .
of what ?
allergic reaction to medication .
he was in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound .
who shot him ?
got away .
report says it was a drug raid
that ended in automatic gunfire .
who wrote that report ?
owen mcgregor .
so the old sheriff realized that his office was corrupt .
they staged a murder . that sounds familiar .
then if the prostitutes witnessed it
and threatened to tell ,
that &apos;s what got them killed .
on what date did the sheriff die ?
it says here march 20 , a year ago .
the same day as the first victim lucas wagner .
so owen &apos;s had a whole year to figure out his end game .
it all started on that night .
you need to see if you can get dinah talking ,
and you need to find out everything you can about owen mcgregor .
what was that about ?
just seeing if she wanted to talk .
a person like dinah &apos;s gotta have some demons .
it &apos;s like she was born into bad choices .
hey , did you get it ?
that &apos;s the cop we &apos;re looking for .
that way ?
affirmative .
he &apos;s right there , isn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s at the nurses station .
oh , i gotta get back to reid .
garcia , get in that room and shut the door .
ok , i did that . now what ?
i need you to focus and i need you to listen to me .
can you do that ?
yes . yes . i can do that ! i can do that !
is there a wheelchair in the room ?
yes .
get reid in it !
that is not gonna be easy .
then get his patient bag . his gun is in there .
oh , my god ! what ?
penelope , i need you to get out in that hallway .
you ok ?
relieved .
i thought it was gonna be the worst day .
i was so afraid reid wasn &apos;t gonna make it .
yeah , but he did .
and look at us now .
we &apos;re gonna go protect a kid
and give his mom another chance .
yeah . doesn &apos;t get much better .
dirty cops doesn &apos;t get much worse .
it &apos;s funny about this job , isn &apos;t it ?
the extremes .
yeah . well , it &apos;s always been that way .
one of the best days of my career
turned out to be one of the worst .
july 16 , 1983 .
child abduction turned murder .
the guy we nabbed killed 5 boys ,
and they were cases we had already tracked .
it was such a victory
in knowing that we &apos;d stopped him from hurting anyone else .
when i got home , my bags were packed .
carolyn had had enough .
i had forgotten our anniversary
again .
as well as all the other little things
that didn &apos;t seem important because ...
saving lives trumped everything .
so i let ours die .
that &apos;s the great balance of life .
always finds a way to knock your legs away .
what the hell ?
they &apos;re headed to get the kid .
what are you talking about ?
they figured it out .
i knew i should have handled this myself .
if you can , make your way to the exit .
not the elevator , please .
what do you want us to do ?
kill them .
thought you said it doesn &apos;t get any worse .
until it does .
are they really gonna shoot federal agents ?
they &apos;re cops who &apos;d rather die than get locked up .
they &apos;re desperate .
she &apos;s coming to you .
have you got one in the chamber ?
yep .
let &apos;s roll .
they rammed us .
we got off a few rounds .
they got away .
we--we messed up .
we got a 10 @-@ 71 on highway 17 . all units respond .
the safe house isn &apos;t too far away .
and dinah will be waiting for us ?
well , we may get there first .
hey , josh , can i take a photo for your mom ?
ok . now , you want to give me a big smile ?
great . ok , go ahead .
he &apos;s with agents now .
oh , my god .
do you agree to cooperate ?
yes . just get me the hell out of here .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve got orders she &apos;s not to leave the premises .
you can tell your boss she &apos;s leaving with me .
you tell yours she &apos;s not .
let go of me .
unless you want to arrested for obstruction
of a federal investigation , let her go .
he &apos;s gone , right ?
he is gone . they &apos;re letting us back in .
all right , good . you did it , baby girl .
i lost a couple karma points ,
but , uh @-@ huh , i did it .
all right , i will be there in about 5 minutes .
i know you and the first victims
witnessed deputy owen kill the former sheriff .
why did he spare you ?
when he looks at me , he sees dollar signs .
he runs everything through the pool hall and i don &apos;t say a word ,
&apos;cause if i did , he &apos;d hurt my son .
and he &apos;s got a lot of help .
i mean , even if people aren &apos;t getting paid off ,
they &apos;re all too scared to say anything .
so the whole force knows ?
enough of them .
what &apos;s he dealing ?
everything .
he gets all the product he can
and then sells it to the higher bidder .
where did he get it .
steals it .
he even smuggles people across the border .
what are they gonna do ?
he wears a badge , they don &apos;t .
where would deputy mcgregor go now
that he knows we &apos;re closing in ?
to a junkyard he controls on the edge of town .
he &apos;s final move &apos;s going to be a distraction .
like what ?
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m just really tired .
of course you are . you need to get some sleep .
oh , but how can you sleep ? &apos; cause you &apos;re in a hospital
where people are always poking you .
he had his meds an hour ago .
yeah , post @-@ op antibiotics .
yeah , he had those , too .
which ones ?
carbenicillin ? no , that &apos;s not right .
i have a severe reaction to beta lactams .
i can &apos;t have that .
that &apos;s not in your chart .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
garcia ! he has a gun !
he &apos;s moving .
ok .
i didn &apos;t know how loud .
i can &apos;t hear , &apos; cause my heart
feels like it &apos;s gonna come out .
can that happen ?
physically , can your heart burst out of your chest ?
and what is this ringing ?
my ears don &apos;t pop for like a week after i fly ,
and if this is like that , that &apos;s gonna drive me bonkers .
am i yelling ? because it feels like i might be yelling .
you saved my life .
can you hear me ?
yeah , i heard that . that makes it better .
thank you for saying that .
thank you for doing it .
ok . you &apos;re ok .
oh , josh .
oh , my sweet boy .
the closest federal support is an hour away .
i &apos;ve called the rangers .
how long for them ?
30 minutes .
hey , morgan . is everyone ok ?
everything &apos;s fine . don &apos;t worry .
it was all a big distraction .
it &apos;s gotta be part of mcgregor &apos;s end game .
he &apos;s headed to a junkyard . i &apos;ll send you the address .
fbi !
ok . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
huh . look at this .
it &apos;s a booked flight .
maybe with the year we &apos;ve all had ,
uh , the brass will give us a bigger plane , you know .
yeah . let me know how that goes .
what did the rangers think ?
sadly , they &apos;ve seen this before .
they &apos;re going to have their hands full cleaning the place up .
hotch , don &apos;t tell me we have another case .
are we turning the plane around ?
no .
no , we &apos;re gonna go home and get some sleep .
lots of it , i hope .
i am starting now .
you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i feel great .
ah , that &apos;s overselling it .
i , uh , i feel great
considering i just got shot in the neck .
where do you want this ?
any -- right there is fine .
ok . so , you should get some sleep .
you all right ?
yesterday touched a nerve
saw you like that .
who &apos;s ethan ?
my son .
he was 9 when he died .
doctors said it was neurological ,
but they didn &apos;t have a name for it .
still don &apos;t . that drove me crazy .
no word to put to this thing
that took away my greatest love .
i &apos;m sorry .
he kept growing despite his disease .
the last time i lay beside him ,
he was almost as long as me .
he was ready to go .
but i wasn &apos;t ready to say good @-@ bye .
i begged him to open his eyes .
and the cruelest part was that i could see
who he would be at 20,
but i knew he &apos;d never get there .
ethan is a great name .
it means enduring .
it &apos;s fitting .
you and james never let go of one another .
have you ever had that feeling
that your future is somehow behind you ?
all the time .
i did , too .
but it isn &apos;t .
ethan would have been a lot like you .
thank you for being there when i woke up .
that meant a lot .
of course .
bye , alex .
