when you &apos;re a kid ,
you always want things to stay the same--
the same teacher , same house ,
same friends .
being a surgeon is no different .
you get used to the same attendings ,
same scrub nurses , same hospital .
hey , cristina .
of course , that all changes
the minute fifth year comes around ...
cristina !
hey !
hey .
and you have to find a new job .
uh , how was dallas ?
ugh . bad .
i can operate circles around the head of the program .
i &apos;m sick of all this schlepping .
from now on , they &apos;re gonna have to come to me .
how was yours ? boston , right ?
uh , san francisco .
i &apos;m supposed to leave for boston tonight ,
but i think i &apos;m gonna cancel .
what ? only an idiot cancels the brigham .
and didn &apos;t bailey set that up for you ?
she &apos;s gonna kill you .
how cute is she ?
hi !
hey , do you need a ride , or is owen , um ...
picking me up ? no .
so how &apos;d it go ?
it was great . hi , baby girl .
oh , my love .
look who &apos;s here .
mama . she missed you .
uh , your idiot wife wants to cancel her interview
at the brigham .
hi , baby girl .
no . you don &apos;t cancel an interview
with the best general surgery
program in the country .
uh @-@ huh . what i said .
why would we move ?
you &apos;ve almost finished the house ,
and you have a job here .
there are other homes and jobs in boston .
you &apos;re going . end of discussion .
good husband .
okay , let &apos;s go .
i will ride in the back with my girl .
i &apos;ll get the bags .
here we go .
i snagged the last croissant ,
and i only had to elbow one orderly out of the way to get it .
i got a secret .
oh , really ?
if i tell you , you can &apos;t tell anybody .
you promise ?
i promise .
i &apos;m in love .
with , uh ...
with whom ?
oh , this is getting ridiculous .
the n.i.h. ?
since when does the n.i.h.
bribe residents to come work for them ?
oh , they don &apos;t ,
except when you &apos;re me-- a god .
hey .
cookie &apos;s stale .
aw , karev .
is this hard for you ,
having to beg for interviews while some of us
just sit back and get wooed ?
no one is begging .
oh , yeah , maybe you should . maybe that way ,
you &apos;d actually get an interview .
ha ! i love mean kepner .
i got an interview .
oh , really , where ?
at ...
places .
whatever ! look , this sucks , okay .
i mean , we got boards in a couple of weeks
and--and now they want us to go on freakin &apos; job interviews ?
there &apos;s only so much crap a guy can have thrown at him
before he snaps .
there &apos;s a trauma coming in on the roof .
kepner , karev , come with me .
i gotta leave for my northwestern interview in an hour .
i told you yesterday .
um , avery ?
sloan &apos;s got me all day , chief . sorry .
i &apos;m free .
great . thank you .
female hiker found at the bottom of a ravine .
positive l.o.c. with obvious head and abdominal trauma ,
hypothermia , frostbite , you name it .
let &apos;s go .
airway looks clear . weakened pulse .
i &apos;m dr. grey . you &apos;re in the hospital .
can you tell us your name ?
okay , okay .
let &apos;s go .
outta the way .
okay , i &apos;m gonna be right on the other side of that glass .
you just try to stay calm .
you weren &apos;t hiking out there , were you ?
what &apos;s the holdup , grey ?
i &apos;m staying in . get me an apron .
okay . here you go .
okay , i &apos;m gonna stay with you .
i &apos;m not leaving . i &apos;ll be right here the whole time .
displaced tibial fracture .
rib fractures , too . lungs look fine .
how far did she fall ?
ah , don &apos;t know . some hikers found her .
what is it , karev ?
uh , jane doe ,
looks to be around 15 years old .
hunt wants you to take a look at her .
hey , any word back on my interviews ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m working on it .
the angle &apos;s off on this elbow .
you &apos;ve been working on it for a couple of weeks now .
well , you &apos;re an acquired taste ,
like blue cheese . some people love it
and some people can &apos;t stand to be in the same room with it .
they think it &apos;s stinky .
so now i &apos;m stinky cheese ?
uh , you can tell hunt this isn &apos;t a peds case .
she &apos;s an adult . the growth plates have closed .
and tell him this elbow was broken a while ago .
see the curve in her forearm
and the periosteal reaction on her humerus ?
these are fractures that never healed right .
or were never treated .
i &apos;ve seen injuries like this in iraq
in patients who were tortured .
she was abused . it &apos;s all over the x @-@ rays .
okay , we have to call the police .
just stay calm .
we don &apos;t know anything for sure until she talks .
hunt , she has a temporal bone fracture .
i &apos;m gonna have to do a middle fossa approach .
there &apos;s an aneurysm in her celiac artery .
i &apos;ll need to put a graft in .
she &apos;s ready to be put under , chief .
wait .
you were running from someone , right ?
is that how you fell ? no one &apos;s gonna hurt you .
we just need to know your name .
he--he called me &quot; susan . &quot;
but i @-@ i think it &apos;s &quot; holly . &quot;
beneath the purple tab you &apos;ll find case studies
from the past year .
under the yellow tab , a list of programs
instituted during my tenure as chief resident .
under the green tab--
&quot; dr. kepner &apos;s cheerful demeanor
and pleasant bedside manner
made my recovery period a true pleasure . &quot;
letters from former patients .
this one &apos;s ... five pages .
just one of many satisfied customers .
okay , moving on to the blue tab--
awards and accolades .
yes , her name was holly wheeler .
we don &apos;t know anything yet .
let &apos;s not jump to conclusions .
it was all over the news .
she was in the grocery store with her mom ,
and somebody just ... took her .
it was the summer of ... 2000 .
so this could be her .
i mean , what , she was probably
8 or 9 at the time ?
she was 6 , and they weren &apos;t in the supermarket ,
they were outside .
her mom bumped into a friend ,
started talking about the block party they were having that weekend .
uh , could she bring a salad ?
they had enough dessert already .
i mean , that &apos;s how long it took for her to realize
that her child wasn &apos;t there anymore .
that story runs through my head
every time tuck walks out the door .
and--and yeah , we don &apos;t know if this is her ,
so please let &apos;s just stop talking about it and operate .
bailey , shepherd , can you stop for a moment ?
what is it ?
the police want us to check for a birthmark under her arm .
the other side , further up .
delivery for dr. yang .
thank you .
that &apos;s not for you .
call a cop . there &apos;s one over there .
who &apos;s on my jock now ?
cleveland clinic . pretty impressive .
i &apos;m not gonna grovel .
you know we &apos;re as good a program as cleveland clinic .
and we &apos;ve got a major stem cell project ,
one that i welcome your input on .
and as far as teachers ,
i &apos;m a catch .
and i &apos;m groveling .
it &apos;s sweet .
come on . let &apos;s go .
okay . can you wiggle your toes ?
painful ?
yeah . you hit your head pretty hard when you fell .
but you &apos;re doing great , okay ?
holly , i &apos;m dr. fincher .
i &apos;m a therapist who works for the hospital .
is it okay if the police ask you a few questions ?
only if you feel up to it .
do you know his name , holly , the man that was keeping you ?
it &apos;s okay .
joseph .
joseph ingles .
that &apos;s great . really helpful .
now can you tell us anything about where you were living ?
was it a house , an apartment ?
it was a house .
one story . it has a basement .
do you know if there was any roads nearby ?
could you hear cars ?
he didn &apos;t let me go outside .
holly , we can stop if you need to .
just let us know .
okay , then . maybe we should--
we should take a break . sure .
you should &apos;ve called me the minute you talked to the police .
she had major brain and abdominal injuries .
my first concern was keeping her alive .
i understand , but the protocol is to call psych right away .
you didn &apos;t ,
and now our patient has bonded with a surgeon .
her name is dr. grey .
dr. grey . fine . that &apos;s who holly has chosen .
there &apos;s no breaking that bond now .
what &apos;s going on ?
dr. fincher thinks that it &apos;s best that you stay with holly ,
at least until her parents arrive .
i have no psych training .
holly spent the last 12 years
with little to no control over anything in her life .
our job is to break that pattern by letting her know that
she and she alone is in control here .
whatever she wants , she gets ,
including you .
we &apos;ll have to work together on this .
okay .
thank you . if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
the family &apos;s waiting for my call .
what was i supposed to say ,
i &apos;m flattered that she likes me ,
but i have a really important job interview ?
i just wanted to ask you ,
did you need me to reschedule your flight ?
yes , i can take the last flight out tonight
and get a cab from here .
okay .
hang in there .
tough case .
you &apos;re doing a good job .
except that i &apos;m not .
her parents are on their way ,
and the press are filling up the parking lot .
i think i might be out of my depth here .
i &apos;ll deal with the parents .
you call phil in security
and have him double the guard presence ,
then call heather in p.r.
and tell her to wrangle the press .
you go home , make sure all your suits are clean .
you &apos;ll need &apos; em for the press conferences .
you &apos;ll be okay , hunt .
what is she like ?
did she speak english ?
or is it like that jodie @-@ foster @-@ in @-@ the @-@ woods movie ?
english , although she &apos;s not really speaking .
she was just flipping through the channels .
i &apos;m guessing the tv reception in the basement wasn &apos;t that great .
are you trying to get out of your interview ?
the parents are on their way .
i &apos;m going . i want to .
really ?
&apos;cause it seems like you want to stay and raise ...
happy cutie babies
with your happy cutie husband .
why are you so fine with leaving ?
because i &apos;m a surgeon ,
and i want to work at the best hospital
with the best people ,
as should you .
since when did you turn into such a sap ?
what do you guys know about carson methodist ?
nothing . i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
it &apos;s in toledo . or an hour outside , i guess .
i interview next week .
where &apos;s toledo ?
canada .
ohio . a quarter of a million people live there .
but this is an hour outside .
robbins set it up for me . i @-@ i can &apos;t not go .
i &apos;ve enjoyed our time together these past few years .
what are you doing ?
we are officially on different career paths .
it &apos;s only polite to say good @-@ bye .
oh , my god . holly ?
it &apos;s her .
it &apos;s her .
i &apos;d know you anywhere . you are ...
still my perfect baby girl .
holly , i know it &apos;s soon , but ...
i would like to hug you .
would that be okay ?
oh , my baby girl .
my baby girl .
baby girl .
we &apos;re a new program ,
so you &apos;re on the verge of something great here .
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re getting in now .
really ?
oh , yeah . we &apos;re even about to upgrade our nicu .
just waiting on the final round of funding .
in fact , that &apos;s why we were so excited to get dr. robbins &apos; call .
she told us all about that money
you raised for those african kids .
melinda , these are the discharge papers
for the liver transplant boy .
could you prep &apos; em for transport ?
you &apos;re discharging a liver transplant ?
we &apos;re not equipped to deal with cases that serious yet .
so we &apos;re shipping him to our sister hospital in toledo .
you hungry ?
it &apos;s make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ sundae day at the cafeteria .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
oh , hey . sorry .
uh , uh , i thought you were ...
i thought you were the kidnapper .
no , no , i--you hear they caught him last night ?
uh , yeah .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , actually . i needed more suits ,
you know , for the press conferences .
i @-@ i thought you were studying at meredith &apos;s .
well , i came home to take a shower .
well , i &apos;ll ... clear up and i &apos;ll get out of your hair .
okay .
you know , just leave it .
stay here .
oh , no , no , no , i--
no , i &apos;m staying at meredith &apos;s until the boards .
i &apos;m never here . so just stay .
you sure ?
until the boards are over .
okay .
i &apos;ll , um ... i &apos;ll go now .
give you some privacy .
this is , i think ,
your first day of school .
6th birthday .
looks like that &apos;s where the bunny came from .
so today dr. torres will be realigning your arm .
you &apos;ll have a lot more mobility in your elbows .
did they really think that this would work ?
give me some photo albums and a stuffed animal ,
and we &apos;d be normal again ?
no , i think that they are just trying to help you remember
because you were only 6 .
well , then tell them that i remember all of it ,
the first day of school and my 6th birthday ,
just like i remember
the first time he made me take my clothes off
and how hard he kicked me
when i didn &apos;t act like i liked it
or how his breath smelled like cigarettes ,
how i could &apos;ve gotten away a bunch of times ,
but every time i made it outside ,
i could hear his voice inside my head ...
that they didn &apos;t want me ,
that i was dead to them .
and that the only reason i finally ran away
was because he told me
that he was gonna take another girl ...
because i was too old and used up
and disgusting now .
tell them that .
we will then repair ,
uh , numerous fractures that never healed properly the first time .
the patient is in good spirits ,
and we &apos;re grateful for the chance to allow her
to heal in a way that wasn &apos;t positive--
pausible--possible before .
we hope--
uh , thank you , dr. torres .
excuse me ! what about her--
how does holly feel about joseph being captured ?
and her parents-- when can we talk to them ?
look , i &apos;m sure the wheelers would appreciate some privacy--
is it true holly &apos;s refusing to speak to them ?
where are her parents ?
it &apos;s a very complicated situation .
it &apos;s not complicated .
it &apos;s not complicated at all .
frank .
the guy &apos;s a monster who stole our kid for 12 years ,
and we &apos;re the ones who are allowed to see her
for only one supervised hour a day .
holly &apos;s in a fragile state .
she &apos;ll need all of us to abide by her wishes ,
even if that means giving her space .
she was brainwashed by him .
she doesn &apos;t know what she wants .
possibly ,
but she still has feelings of blame and resentment
that she has to process .
right now you &apos;re still strangers to her .
&apos;cause you won &apos;t let us go in there and be her parents !
did you show her the photo album ?
did she remember ?
not even the bunny ? she loved that thing .
she didn &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;ll come back to you .
it might take some time ,
but the memories are still there .
you just have to be patient .
oh , hey , chief .
um , i haven &apos;t heard back yet from northwestern ,
and i know you &apos;re close with dr. mitchell .
have you , uh , have you spoken to him ?
uh , yes , he said your resume was impressive .
oh , thank goodness .
keep your options open , though .
what do you mean ? he said he thought i was impressive .
he also said he wasn &apos;t sure
if it was a match personality @-@ wise .
personality ? i &apos;m-- i &apos;m asking for a job ,
not a date to the prom .
damn reporters .
sorry . hello .
chisel , please .
man , look at all this callus formation .
he would &apos;ve had to break this arm three or four times
to get this amount of scar tissue .
and the humerus is pretty strong , even in a young kid .
kinda makes you sick
just thinking about the amount of ...
force it took to break it--
can we talk about something else ?
i mean , you know , who knows what they hear subconsciously ?
so it ...
maybe it wouldn &apos;t hurt to come up with a conversation
about something other than every parent &apos;s worst nightmare .
avery scored an interview at u.c.l.a.
that is not what she meant .
no , that--that &apos;s good . let &apos;s hear about that .
well , it &apos;s a top @-@ 10 program , which is impressive .
of course , it &apos;s just as much a reflection
on me as a teacher as it is his surgical skill .
okay .
hey . how was canada ?
ugh . canada would &apos;ve been better than that dump .
you want me to call the chief at duke ?
he wants me so bad , he &apos;ll do anything i tell him ,
even accept you .
drill , please .
what &apos;s hunt gonna do anyway if you leave ?
oh , that &apos;s right .
you say &quot; duke , &quot; and he &apos;s on the next plane .
guy &apos;s so whipped .
she &apos;s not going to duke ,
and neither are you .
this is a great program ,
and we &apos;d be crazy to leave .
that &apos;s because you want to play shrink to your patient
for the rest of your life .
she imprinted on me . what am i supposed to do ?
how &apos;s she doing anyway ?
great . i mean , better .
i found two granola bars under her bed this morning .
but at least she didn &apos;t lie about where they came from .
fincher says she &apos;s talking more in therapy ,
athough she &apos;s not talking to frank and kathleen .
she was being kept 5 miles away from their house ,
and they didn &apos;t find her .
you don &apos;t just get over something like that .
maybe she could move in with you
when we all leave .
adele , baby .
are you ready for dinner ?
aah ! this is a private room !
get out !
you get that man out of here !
dr. webber--
it &apos;s assault . she was vulnerable .
you just don &apos;t let a man--
please , sir--
he took advantage of my wife .
he &apos;s a predator .
if you don &apos;t get him out , i will sue .
dr. webber , allan has alzheimer &apos;s .
his is quite progressed ,
further along than your wife &apos;s , even .
he &apos;s not a predator .
he &apos;s a patient here .
you know , i don &apos;t have to tell you
that columbia has a cutting @-@ edge cardio program .
so i hope the fact that i &apos;ve flown cross country
to come knocking on your door
shows you just how serious we are about --
can you pass me the butter ?
yeah .
thank you .
you should come to new york to visit .
you like theater ?
i can get you tickets to any musical you &apos;d like .
oh , i hate musicals .
i do like wine , though .
waiter .
more wine .
coming .
there &apos;s an old fracture in your pelvis
that dr. torres is concerned about .
it &apos;s called an avulsion fracture .
at first i thought it might have happened when you ran away ,
but this injury is a lot older than that .
do you remember when the pain first started
or anything that might &apos;ve happened right before that ,
a ... a fall , maybe ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t .
maybe it happened after i had the baby .
it was a few years ago .
i @-@ i think it died .
i couldn &apos;t walk for a long time after . i @-@ i ...
it must have happened then , right ?
uh ... that &apos;s ...
yes , that &apos;s ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t -- - no .
should -- - no . it &apos;s --
should i not have said anything ?
excuse me .
it &apos;s okay .
sorry i &apos;m late .
no , it &apos;s been a while since you &apos;ve been in my o.r.
i &apos;m honored you showed up .
has grey been ditching you , too , for interviews ?
cristina has been so distracted .
meredith , do you know who she &apos;s talking to today ?
stanford , i think .
stanford ? wh --
since when has she been interested in stanford ?
you blame her ?
you &apos;d be a fool not to pursue cardio at stanford .
kinda like ... general at the brigham .
i told you , the program director
was very understanding when i called .
and you believed her after canceling three times ?
you know how many strings i had to pull to get you in there ?
well , the chief assigned this case to me .
what am i supposed to do ?
stanford ? i mean , that is just -- that &apos;s far .
hunt is really okay with that ?
grey , will you , uh , tie these vessels off ?
she &apos;s been through enough .
she doesn &apos;t need to worry about some jerk
taking her picture in the hall .
i am so sorry .
well , don &apos;t be , just ...
help me , okay ?
help me keep her safe .
it won &apos;t happen again .
hey , um , teddy needed you to sign off
on the stem cell paperwork .
okay .
people have cameras on their phones .
he can &apos;t expect you to ban phones from the hospital .
no , no , but i can make sure that the hallways are clear
before they move her , or security keeps a lookout .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not thinking .
i &apos;m making mistakes ...
in over my head .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to be the chief .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to be this ... guy . i &apos;m ...
i mean , how am i the guy
that ends up making this man &apos;s daughter more hurt
than she already is ?
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m failing . i &apos;m ...
you &apos;re doing the best you can .
and how was your day ,
my little scootchie coo ?
did you just have so much fun playing with zola ?
you know , she doesn &apos;t understand you any better
the more idiotic you sound .
hey , zola . good evening .
good evening . how are you ?
tuck ?
tucker ?
hey , don &apos;t be shy .
hey , uh , where &apos;s tuck ?
i &apos;m not sure . he was ... just here .
you don &apos;t know ?
you know it &apos;s your job to know where my son is ?
tara , when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
a few minutes ago . i swear , he was right here .
a few ...
try it again .
wh --
um , call , a @-@ a code pink .
right now .
what ? no , there &apos;s a protocol for a code --
hey , hey , my son is missing . okay ? he &apos;s gone .
you took your eyes off of him , and he &apos;s gone .
now you pick up that phone ,
and you make that call right now ,
or i swear to god , i will have your throat .
tara , just do it .
just call the code pink !
i &apos;ll look for him .
yes , we have a code pink .
a 5 @-@ year @-@ old boy , missing i -- i &apos;m not sure how long .
um , i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s wearing a green @-@ striped ...
please don &apos;t just stand there .
okay ? look . help me find him . oh , god .
he &apos;s probably screaming &apos; cause he knows to scream
if there &apos;s a @-@ a stranger .
just ... oh , god . he &apos;s screaming .
he &apos;s scream ...
dr. bailey .
what ?
he had a nosebleed .
i @-@ i took him to the nurse .
what ?
what ? there you are !
come here . let me see . is that ...
let me see that tissue .
oh , my goodness .
oh , well , then i guess , um ...
yes , you can cancel ...
where was he ?
we &apos;re gonna have to go ...
nosebleed .
get you an ice cream .
yeah ? yeah ? well , let &apos;s go home .
and , uh , let &apos;s , uh , get some ice cream .
here . come on , sweetheart .
oh , i can &apos;t believe you had a nosebleed .
and ...
that should just about do it .
加州大学洛杉矶分校
impressive .
most of our candidates can &apos;t get the detail
on the triangular fossa .
yeah , well , uh , if this whole surgeon thing doesn &apos;t pan out ,
then i guess i could take my act on the road .
you know , just set up a little whittling booth
at a county fair .
i think people would pay good money for that ,
especially when they hear ,
it &apos;s made by harper avery &apos;s grandson .
which reminds me ,
do you think that he &apos;d ever be interested
in doing a lecture here ?
we &apos;ve been after him for years .
you &apos;re a name brand .
you &apos;re like the freakin &apos; ritz @-@ carlton of surgery .
who cares if that &apos;s why they want you ?
because he knows deep down he &apos;s more of a roadside motel .
oh , oh , oh , she &apos;s going for the soup .
bold move . she &apos;s gonna have to talk to the soup guy .
she &apos;s looking good . looking confident .
and she bails .
no soup for holly .
she looks terrified .
why are you so mean ?
would you just go buy her some soup ?
no , it &apos;s not mean .
she &apos;s going home soon , and dr. fincher says ,
she has to learn to do things for herself .
mm . and you &apos;re gonna finally
have to go to boston for your interview .
i am not avoiding the interview .
really ?
well , wherever you go ,
just beware , they may judge you more on your personality
than what really matters , like your resume .
meredith is not like you . her personality doesn &apos;t suck .
oh , pizza station .
hey .
oh , whatever ! you know what ? those programs can suck it .
i &apos;m tired of trying so hard not to be me .
you know what ? i like me .
that makes one of us .
you make it so easy .
look , you don &apos;t have to not be you .
just be a little less you . that &apos;s all .
get up .
what are you doing ?
claire hiatt just called to tell me
you walked out on your interview .
call her back , apologize .
look , i respectfully withdrew my application .
you want me to drag you out by your ear ?
i ...
freakin &apos; robbins .
so i didn &apos;t actually , uh , speak to anyone .
but ... i ...
uh , did go to the self @-@ serve station .
and it actually wasn &apos;t that hard .
what ?
nothing . looks good .
you know who is an awesome mentor ?
ooh , you &apos;re gonna say me ,
and we &apos;re gonna high @-@ five , right ?
sloan . he gets avery interviews at hospitals
who have more to offer
than the sundaes in their cafeteria .
oh , relax . i just heard back from a colleague in florida ,
and he &apos;s dying to meet you .
miami ?
mm . tampa .
well , just a little outside .
why are you doing this ? i thought you liked me .
of course i do , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve spent tons of time
turning you into a great doctor .
and now for my trouble , what , you &apos;re gonna ditch me
for some other program ?
you don &apos;t want me to go .
you &apos;ve been tanking my recommendations .
i know . it &apos;s awful . i feel really guilty about it .
but you don &apos;t know how hard it is to find a good peds fellow ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let them take my best candidate .
i &apos;m your best ?
go away .
look , get on the phone ,
tell the people you actually respect that i &apos;m the best--
yale , baylor , brown .
no more &quot; one hour outside of toledos . &quot;
did you not just hear me ? i &apos;m not gonna help you leave .
you want me to stay here because i want to ,
not because i have no other choice .
call .
hey .
how are you feeling ?
that was a pretty big deal .
not really .
i don &apos;t know .
braving that cafeteria line is pretty major ,
even for those of us who haven &apos;t been--
kept in a basement for 12 years ? - for those of us
who haven &apos;t been through what you &apos;ve been through .
why do you do that ,
talk around it ?
the therapist and my parents and ...
what i &apos;ve been through is being ...
kicked and raped and slapped and starved .
and i mean , i get it , but ...
it was my life .
and i didn &apos;t get to talk to him
about my life with my parents ,
and now i don &apos;t get to talk to anyone about him .
but you can talk about him .
no , i can &apos;t .
no , you &apos;ll--you &apos;ll think ...
you won &apos;t get it .
try me .
he wasn &apos;t only bad .
sometimes he was okay .
he &apos;d let me go upstairs and ...
we &apos;d watch stuff together--
movies .
and it was like it was normal .
when i came back here , i turned on the tv ,
and there was this ...
movie on that we watched together .
and i started to miss him .
and i know that &apos;s bad , and i must be sick .
and don &apos;t tell the shrink that i said anything ,
&apos;cause she ...
she &apos;s gonna ask me how i feel about it .
and i don &apos;t know .
all i know is , is ...
i should be happy that i &apos;m here and not there .
but sometimes i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s okay .
however you feel is okay .
they &apos;ve called three times to see if you &apos;d received it .
what self @-@ respecting program sends a fruit basket anyway ?
champagne , sure , but fruit ?
fruit just says your program sucks .
who &apos;s that ?
uh , hopkins .
hopkins in maryland ?
yeah .
well ... hopkins is a great program .
and they &apos;re recruiting you , so that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s something to be proud of .
do you want an apple ?
yeah .
well , you have a better view of the pond .
you know , i heard that mrs. thompson across the hall
has a great movie collection .
adele , what is it ?
he hasn &apos;t come to visit or call .
i don &apos;t know what i did wrong .
you did nothing wrong , honey .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;m your husband ,
for 30 years now .
i &apos;m right here . i ...
this is us ...
on our wedding day .
your mother took it right after the ceremony .

12天后
patient is 18 @-@ year @-@ old female holly wheeler .
dr. altman ?
i got the page from dr. yang at 2218,
and then met her and dr. bailey in the o.r. ,
where we discovered that the previous graft
had become infected .
while we tried to interpose another graft
away from the infection ,
she arrested several times on the table .
we had to restart internal cardiac massage ,
give her an intracardiac epi ,
and fortunately , we were able to resuscitate her .
dr. bailey was then able to repair the graft
and other than some initial
touch and go in the c.c.u. ,
she has been stable ever since .
your recommendation ?
patient is healthy and ready to go home .
neuro ?
signed off .
ortho ?
we &apos;re good .
plastics ?
send her home .
and general ?
dr. bailey ?
dr. bailey signs off .
great .
well , holly will continue her therapy with dr. fincher ,
but as far as surgery is concerned ,
she &apos;s set to go home .
thank you , everyone ,
and especially , a thank you to dr. grey .
okay , that &apos;s--
that &apos;s enough . let &apos;s get back to work .
great job , hunt .
thanks . thank you .
they &apos;re good parents , right ?
i mean , they seem like good parents .
they &apos;ve been here every day since you came in ,
all day , just in case you want to see them .
i have a daughter .
and i know i would want to hold her and never let go .
and they haven &apos;t done that .
they have tried to give you space
and just tried to understand
what this must be like for you .
just give them a chance .
just talk to them the way you talk to me .
the car &apos;s all packed . we have everything ?
uh , yeah , i think so .
we can &apos;t thank you enough .
of course .
oh , you don &apos;t want to leave this behind .
yeah .
actually , i do .
um , i don &apos;t know .
it just reminds me of everything that i--
i missed out on .
i &apos;m sorry . i know that it--
it means a lot to you guys , so--so we can take it
if you--if you want , but--
no , it &apos;s fine . we can leave it .
it &apos;s one of those things people say ...
you can &apos;t move on
until you &apos;ve let go of the past .
you have to make her stay .
what ?
cristina--she just told me
that she is flying to new york tonight to visit columbia ,
and they are gonna roll out the red carpet for her
just like every other hospital in this country .
and pretty soon , we are gonna be one of ten places
that she can pick , and we are gonna lose her .
we can &apos;t let that happen .
she is gifted and brilliant , and i ...
this hospital can &apos;t lose her .
she wants to go . it &apos;s her decision .
i can &apos;t make her stay .
owen , you are her husband ,
and whatever is going on between the two of you ,
i don &apos;t care . just fix it and make her stay .
you make her stay .
you &apos;re the head of cardio . she &apos;s your resident .
if you want her to stay , you make it happen .
and don &apos;t you ever talk to me about my wife again .
i &apos;m your chief , not your friend .
you &apos;ve made that very clear .
letting go is the easy part .
it &apos;s the moving on that &apos;s painful .
you have a good life here . you ...
have friends , and , you know , sometimes ...
well , i @-@ i can get in the way of--of all that .
of course , now if you need anything ,
just pick up the phone ,
and i &apos;ll stop everything , and i &apos;ll come right over .
i love you , adele .
and i always will .
allan , um ...
come--come and sit down .
i was just on my way out .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
so sometimes we fight it ...
try and keep things the same .
&quot; be less you &quot; ?
how do you be less yourself ?
there .
less you .
what ?
you put on your suit ?
i gotta be at yale first thing in the morning .
what if my flight gets delayed ?
or even worse , what if you go in there looking like a hobo
in a wrinkled ass jacket ?
where &apos;d you learn that ?
i &apos;m an avery . we know these things .
so i rescheduled my interview at brigham ,
and i leave in an hour .
cheers to that .
jackson , we gotta go .
and we &apos;re out .
happy interviewing , losers .
i should go , too .
don &apos;t leave .
it &apos;s yale . no way in hell am i missing that flight
to hang out with you two drunks .
later .
don &apos;t choke .
bartender . two tequilas , please .
two more .
you know ...
this wouldn &apos;t be a totally bad bar to hang out in
if we miss our flights .
plenty of traveling salesmen to hit on .
well , our husbands would never know .
cheers .
cheers .
things can &apos;t stay the same , though .
flight 1243 to j.f.k. is now boarding at gate 19 .
well ...
free flight to new york .
i &apos;d say wish me luck , but ...
i don &apos;t need it .
cristina .
you really want to do this-- leave ?
we &apos;ve been preparing for this for the past five years .
of course i want to leave .
you should , too .
at some point , you just have to let go ...
move on ...

so if miranda bailey tells me
一天后
i need to meet a young surgeon ,

i need to know how serious you are
about our program ,
moving to boston .
because no matter how painful it is ...
very serious . in fact , it &apos;s my top choice .
