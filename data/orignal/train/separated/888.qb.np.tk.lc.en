ah , the toy crazes of the &apos; 80s .
g.i. joe , laser tag , rubik &apos;s cube ,
transformers , care bears .
but the mother of them all were the cabbage patch kids --
chubby @-@ cheeked balls of cuteness
you could adopt as your very own .
and i got mine in a most unusual way .
in my hand ,
i hold your final exam for health class --
the reality of parenting .
wow . how many of these do you own ?
you know , i &apos;m not married ,
and i &apos;m severely allergic to cat and dog dander ,
so i guess you could say these are like my children .
that &apos;s a joke . i &apos;m fine .
okay .
so , for this assignment , you are going to pair up
and you &apos;re going to tend to the child as if it &apos;s a real baby .
and every 30 minutes , you &apos;re gonna spin the wheel
and do the assigned chore -- feeding , burping , diapering .
you get it -- the things that married couples do .
or ... so i &apos;ve seen
from my three married younger sisters .
okay , partner up .
dana isabelle caldwell ,
will you be the mother of my cabbage ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t want this to make things weird between us .
trust me -- a baby only makes things better .
it &apos;s like the old saying --
&quot; if your relationship sucks , a baby will fix it . &quot;
okay , so , maybe i was way off about that ,
but i did know that this project
was the perfect way for me to get closer to dana .
welcome to our tree home , my dear .
i &apos;ve already put down the baby and whipped us up some supper .
smurf ravioli -- my favorite .
well , only the best for my girl dana
and our little angel , ripley .
ripley ?
it &apos;s a classic girl &apos;s name .
also happens to be
sigourney weaver &apos;s badass character in &quot; aliens . &quot;
how about one that &apos;ll make us both happy ?
leia .
leia delorean goldberg !
i love it !
snuggle boo @-@ boo ! dinner &apos;s ready !
what is all this ?
health class . we got to care for a pretend baby .
oh , i &apos;m finally a grandma , huh ?
well , move over . isn &apos;t this fun ?
come on . let me hold her .
actually , um , we &apos;re not supposed to get
any outside help with leia .
&quot; leia &quot; ? oh , no , no , no , no , no .
that &apos;s so boring and plain .
what about &quot; myrna , &quot; after your great @-@ grandma ?
um , maybe .
yeah , i mean , i @-@ it was a name in progress --
was it ?
everyone agrees . myrna it is .
okay , i get how this works .
we spin the thing and do the thingy .
baby &apos;s got poo @-@ poos .
let me change her .
actually , we &apos;re good . thanks .
well , uh , i &apos;m gonna go check in on your father .
i &apos;m sure he still needs me .
as usual ,
my smother had jammed herself into my life
and made it real awkward real quick .
i had to do some epic damage control -- and fast .
how about a toast to the world &apos;s greatest mom ?
somebody call me ?
no ?
okay .
it was march 10th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and barry was chilling with his best and only friends ,
the jenkintown posse -- also known as the jtp .
all right , batter up .
i got , uh , an egg , a grapefruit , and a light bulb .
grapefruit ! let &apos;s go , baby ! come on ! game on .
smash ball ! smash ball !
smash ball !
dude , the citrus is burning my eyes !
i can &apos;t see ! that &apos;s awesome !
barry goldberg ,
king of smash ball and king of the jtp !
jtp !
this was fun . see ya .
wai-- what ? what ?
you just got here , man .
you said tonight was gonna be legendary .
sorry , guys .
i made plans with my special lady .
what happened to you , bro ?
since that girl came into your life ,
it &apos;s like we don &apos;t even exist , man .
yeah , dude . it &apos;s time you made a choice .
it &apos;s either us
or the super @-@ hot , popular girl that you make out with .
her . 100 % her .
lainey ? ! you &apos;re here ? !
i &apos;ve been calling your house for the last two hours !
we have to get ready for anthony balsamo &apos;s party .
god , i &apos;m so sorry , erica . i totally forgot .
me and bar decided we were gonna stay in
and have a romantic evening together .
i &apos;ve been holding in a fart this whole time .
well , i can &apos;t just go to the party by myself .
that &apos;s pathetic .
it is pathetic . invite her to watch with us .
i &apos;d rather not . i find she sucks .
i can hear you . and you suck .
lainey , next friday we &apos;re hanging out . no excuses .
oooh , my girl &apos;s gonna be busy that night .
tickets to the heart concert ? !
no way ! lainey and i have been talking about going for months !
which is how i knew
it &apos;d score me major points to get us tickets .
i can &apos;t believe you pulled this off .
you are the best !
oh , my god . what is that smell ?
hey , guys ?
things have been kind of weird with dana .
thought i should ask you about it .
sure thing , kiddo .
happy to help .
and i , also , am here .
why is dana super @-@ pissed at me for siding with mom over her
when it comes to raising kids ?
you never side with your mother over your lady , you moron .
pack up your toys and move to another town .
the life you &apos;ve built here is over .
but it &apos;s like what mom always says --
&quot; happy mom , happy life . &quot;
no ! the phrase is &quot; happy wife , happy life . &quot;
it rhymes !
i thought &quot; happy mom , happy life &quot; was clunky !
i &apos;m such a putz !
ohh , it &apos;s dana . what do i tell her ?
that she &apos;s calling the shots in your relationship .
you hear me ? now , tell her , damn you !
it &apos;s getting late , so we should feed myrna .
actually , i &apos;ve been thinking .
let &apos;s go with leia -- the name you want .
really ? what about your mom ?
hey , this is your cabbage patch ,
and i completely and fully support
your decisions on all matters .
thank you .
i mean , i totally appreciate your mom wanting to help ,
but she needs to know it &apos;s our project .
exactly .
so you &apos;ll let her know ?
know what , now ?
you know , to stay out of it .
set some boundaries .
boundaries ?
uh , you know my mom . that &apos;s a big ask .
i ... guess i could talk to her .
you know what ? yeah . that &apos;s perfect .
she &apos;s in the kitchen right now .
i not only took their advice ,
i hit it out of the park .
are you nuts ?
you never let your mother and your wife
hash things out with each other .
you got to be the buffer .
otherwise , it spirals into chaos .
okay , you guys need to tell me this great advice
before i fudge the bed !
while i was running off to save my relationship ,
the jtp was still mourning the loss of barry goldberg .
dudes , it &apos;s barry &apos;s bananas hot sister .
okay , be cool . let the ladies &apos; man handle this .
i &apos;m panicking . someone take over .
greetings , m &apos;lady .
uh , what doth bring thou to our domain ?
so , this is where you guys hang out all the time , huh ?
what do you do here ?
do you want to play smash ball with us ?
i really don &apos;t .
smash ball . smash ball .
smash ball ! smash ball ! smash ball ! smash ball !
okay ! okay ! stop saying &quot; smash ball . &quot;
fine . i &apos;ll play your weird game .
okay . in there . not gonna touch you .
it &apos;s over there . okay .
and then ... lettuce .
got it . all right .
um , okay .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
and just like that ,
erica swung her way into the hearts of the jtp .
big e !
yes !
so , you guys going to anthony balsamo &apos;s party ?
hell yeah !
par @-@ tay !
balsamo !
so , you guys don &apos;t know about it , then ?
no , what &apos;s -- where is that ? - no , we don &apos;t .
balsamo .
well , i guess you guys can tag along --
if you don &apos;t act weird
and naked rob doesn &apos;t get naked .
dat &apos;s cool . i only get naked around dudes .
after a surprisingly fun night with barry &apos;s friends ,
my sister formulated a plan
to reclaim her friend from barry .
yo , big e !
over here !
oh , dude , she &apos;s coming over .
what the hell is she doing ?
looks like she joined the jtp .
jtp !
jtp !
no . no way !
you can &apos;t say &quot; jtp &quot; unless you &apos;re in the jtp .
which is why she said it .
and you &apos;re out , bro .
we got a new leader --
one who actually gets us into cool parties .
wait -- you took them to anthony balsamo &apos;s party ?
you were too busy running your hands over barry &apos;s lumpy melon .
nice burn , big e.
you can &apos;t call her &quot; big e . &quot;
that &apos;s way too close to &quot; big tasteee . &quot;
it &apos;ll cause marketplace confusion !
i &apos;m sorry , bar , but it looks like big e &apos;s in charge now .
jtp out .
jtp out !
jtp out .
aw , sweetie .
you &apos;re not allowed to say that anymore .
i thought raising a fake baby with dana would bring us together ,
but it was only pushing apart .
hey . you would not believe the day i &apos;ve had .
don &apos;t care . just take her .
whoa , whoa . what &apos;s this ?
at least let me walk through the door .
i &apos;ve been here dealing with the baby all by myself .
this assignment &apos;s impossible .
where were you ?
out mowing lawns .
you know -- my job .
nice try . i called mrs . bales .
that ended two hours ago .
i went to the arcade
to blow off steam with some buddies .
and why are you even checking up on me ?
i played one game and left .
one game ? please .
i smell pizza on your breath .
it &apos;s not my fault . i didn &apos;t even ask for this kid !
okay .
this is super @-@ weird .
maybe we should just take a break from all of this
and -- and go to a movie or something .
just us -- no baby .
we can get a sitter .
and so we did get a sitter --
a man who had been sitting on his ass
for as long as i could remember .
unfortunately , my mom wasn &apos;t one
to sit on the sidelines of any situation .
what &apos;s that ?
what &apos;s what ?
the little foot sticking out .
just adam &apos;s baby .
i &apos;m using it for lumbar support .
did they entrust the baby to you over me ?
over me ?
you do know none of this is real ?
oh , it &apos;s real .
don &apos;t you get it ?
this is how adam is gonna treat me
when i really am a bubbie .
i &apos;m gonna prove to him that i &apos;m the best grandma ever .
&quot; grandma , &quot; &quot; gam @-@ gam , &quot; &quot; bubbie &quot; --
didn &apos;t matter what she went by .
my mom was determined to be the best .
she changed the toy . she fed it .
she even took it to the park .
ohh ! your baby &apos;s so cute .
aww . and yours is ...
oh , boy .
thank you .
yep .
my mom was on her way
to helping us get an &quot; a &quot; on this assignment ...
until a dog mistook the baby for a chew toy .
my baby .
somebody stole my baby !
well , not real baby -- fake baby . it &apos;s a toy .
somebody stole my toy !
i &apos;m gonna get attitude from my son &apos;s pretend wife !
can someone call the police ?
or toys &quot; r &quot; us ?
i don &apos;t know anymore !
as my mom was realizing she had to figure out
how to replace our little angel ,
barry was learning just how replaceable he was .
no way .
&quot; brian &apos;s song &quot; ? !
that &apos;s our secret guy @-@ cry movie !
beat it , bar . this is just jtp .
jtp .
get over here .
get over here .
you can &apos;t just use my friends as pawns in your sick game .
you can have your precious jtp back anytime you want .
just stop hanging out with lainey .
your move .
but , unfortunately for erica , the next move was not barry &apos;s .
gah ! what are you --
i came for a root beer , too .
it &apos;s crazy how we had the same idea .
it &apos;s like ... it &apos;s like fate , right ?
here , let me --
what ?
we should probably get back to the movie .
everyone &apos;s probably wondering where we are .
we &apos;ve been gone three minutes .
it feels like forever .
such a beautiful movie about friendship and football
and ...
i &apos;ll get you a --
we both went for the --
what are the odds ?
it &apos;s crazy , right ?
what &apos;s happening ?
you tell me .
i &apos;m just gonna go sit over here .
i &apos;m sorry . are -- are you okay ?
for the first time in a long time ,
i think i &apos;m gonna be just fine .
um , guys , take a seat for me .
to be clear , we &apos;re all just friends here , right ?
just friends .
amigos .
i love you .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna leave my own house now .
across town , my mom was desperate
to save my grade and her reputation as a bubbie ,
but cabbage patch kids were in such high demand
that her only chance was to turn to the black market .
you rick ?
shh ! no names , all right ?
just be cool .
what do you need ?
i got glo worm , i got voltron ,
i got koosa , i got my little pony .
oh . i also have the strongest heroine in the world .
what ? !
she @-@ ra , princess of power .
there &apos;s no stronger heroine out there .
i need a cabbage patch kid .
female , red yarny hair , blue eyes .
you got expensive taste , girl .
cpks are sold out across the country .
it &apos;s gonna cost ya .
yes . that &apos;s what bubbie needs .
how much for that one ?
for a pretty lady like you ,
i suppose i could let one go for 3 large .
$ 3,000 ? !
is that ... what &quot; large &quot; is ?
i meant $ 300 .
well , that &apos;s still ridiculous .
as my mom was trying
to negotiate the best possible price ,
we were about to pay the price
for not getting a real babysitter .
hey , dad , how &apos;d it go ?
really , really bad .
mom --
shhh ! baby &apos;s sleeping .
just kidding . her eyes are wide open all the time .
but don &apos;t worry . we had a great day .
and i did everything the spinner said .
i &apos;d say i proved i &apos;m an excellent bubbie .
excellent how ? adam , look at it .
oh ! balls !
this is a fake .
what did you do , mom ?
okay , there are some ugly accusations flying about ,
and if that &apos;s not myrna ,
then i have failed as a grandmother .
read the label .
&quot; lettuce crop child . &quot;
that is unfortunate .
you know what ?
you two should just finish this project together .
wait ! don &apos;t go ! i can &apos;t be a single dad !
oh , you &apos;ll never be single as long as you have me , schmoopie .
geoff , what are you doing ? !
it &apos;s from &quot; say anything ... &quot;
that &apos;s how your dorky little brother
got a hot girl way out of his league .
that &apos;s not even the right song !
to be honest , i never saw the movie .
stop &quot; say anything ... &quot; -ing me and go home .
erica goldberg , leader of the jtp ,
i proclaim my love --
what the hell , geoff ? !
get lost , pal ! i called her first !
uh , no . no one called me . i &apos;m not callable .
erica goldberg !
listen to this sweet song and know my heart is --
dude , you took my boombox ?
relax . i just needed it for tonight .
yeah , well , so did i !
i had to borrow my uncle &apos;s cheap @-@ ass radio ,
and it &apos;s stuck on tejano music .
okay , both of you shut up , because she &apos;s mine !
stop it !
that &apos;s not true ! she &apos;s mine !
that &apos;s not true !
no ! stop it !
none of you will win me !
you have to --
oh , my god ! naked rob is naked under that coat !
i wanted you to be the first girl to see me naked !
well , well .
looks like the worm is on the other foot .
help me ! please make it stop !
messing with those poor goobers to break us up is so not cool .
what was i supposed to do ?
i get it . you two make each other happy .
but i didn &apos;t know
that meant i &apos;d lose you and be left all alone .
seriously ?
does this look like a cabbage patch kid to you ?
okay , this is a cabbage patch kid .
this looks like something in a horror movie
where the doll comes alive and terrorizes a lakeside town .
look , it &apos;s not dana &apos;s fault .
please don &apos;t fail her . fail me .
no , it &apos;s my fault .
if you &apos;re gonna fail anyone , fail me .
i can &apos;t ... fail you , mrs. goldberg . you &apos;re an adult .
also , why are you here ?
yeah , adam . why is she here ?
i &apos;m just trying to help , like any good bubbie would .
a good bubbie doesn &apos;t lose her grandchild .
i heard that . bubbies hear everything .
enough !
mom , i know you mean well ,
but all you &apos;ve done is screw things up for me and dana .
look , i don &apos;t know when i &apos;ll have a family ,
and i don &apos;t know who it &apos;ll be with .
i @-@ i @-@ it could be dana . it could be molly ringwald .
all i know is that when i do get married ,
you &apos;re gonna need to butt out .
okay , but i --
no &quot; buts &quot; -- except for yours butting out .
thanks for coming .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all wondering why i brought you here .
you &apos;re gonna choose which one of us you &apos;ll take as your lover .
ew ! god , no !
i &apos;m doing the complete opposite of that .
i &apos;m resigning as leader of the jtp .
jtp !
did you even hear what i said ?
i &apos;m out ! no more jtp !
jtp !
god !
allow me .
here &apos;s the deal , fellas .
you &apos;re all so insanely awesome
that erica loves you all equally , okay ?
for her to choose one of you
would literally break her brain in half ,
sending her into a coma forever .
oh . that makes sense .
her only real option is to step down
so i can resume my role as leader and god of the jtp .
jtp . jtp .
here .
your heart tickets ? seriously ?
think i &apos;m gonna hang with my boys that night .
i suggest you hang with your girl .
want to ?
yes !
it was one of those major life lessons
barry and erica had to learn the hard way .
sometimes , you &apos;ll find
that special someone who changes everything ,
but having your best friends there to cheer you on
is what the game is all about .
mr. goldberg , a moment please .
i &apos;ve changed my mind on your grade .
really ?
you know , the point of the project
was to learn what it &apos;s like to be a real parent .
changing diapers -- oh , that &apos;s easy .
protecting your lady from her nightmare in @-@ laws ?
whew . that &apos;s an &quot; a . &quot;
dana .
what &apos;s all this ?
a thank @-@ you for standing up for me ...
and an apology for how weird things got .
it got quite weird .
but i give you my word --
from now on , i &apos;m gonna make sure
my mom stays as far away from us as possible .
actually , your mom &apos;s not so bad .
she &apos;s the one who invited me over
and helped me with all this .
in the end ,
my mom stopped worrying about being the best bubbie
and just focused on being my awesome mom .
oh , god , mur .
butting out is so hard .
yeah , but look at him . he &apos;s having so much fun .
doesn &apos;t that make you happy ?
damn it , it does .
that &apos;s good for me .
happy wife , happy life .
that &apos;s the thing about being a parent --
it &apos;s tough ,
and it doesn &apos;t come with a spinner and instructions .
you learn as you go .
but seeing the smile on my face that night
gave my mom a new saying --
&quot; happy kids , happy life . &quot;
ahh . back for more ?
i came to return this shoddy knock @-@ off .
you bought a bootleg toy out of a trunk .
all sales are final .
well , at least let me trade it for this .
wow , it &apos;s crazy how two people can reach into a trunk
and their fingers just ... kind of meet , you know ?
i &apos;m gonna take this as a lesson
never to buy toys from a man &apos;s trunk behind a warehouse .
i also sell a lifetime of devotion and tenderness .
