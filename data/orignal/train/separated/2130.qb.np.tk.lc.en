hello , dad .
spoke to aunt deb last week .
looks like she &apos;s gonna give chemo a shot .
she , um ...
she said to me , &quot; the mcgarretts are fighters . &quot;
and mary , mary &apos;s good .
you wouldn &apos;t believe it , dad , but she has , uh ...
she &apos;s become such a strong woman .
and she &apos;s such a great mother to that little girl .
she sends me videos , like , every other day .
i &apos;m getting to watch joanie grow up .
it &apos;s amazing .
kid &apos;s starting to take her first steps .
i really wish you were here for all of this .
i think you would have liked being a grandfather .
i miss you , dad .
hey , mary .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
no , no , no , i &apos;m here now .
i just , i wanted to call you guys
and just check on you , see how you &apos;re doing .
i know . four years .
no , it &apos;s crazy .
yeah .
no , i &apos;m right here .
hey , mary , listen , let me call you back , okay ?
excuse me !
hi . i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i @-@ i saw you at ... john mcgarrett &apos;s grave .
did you know him ?
you &apos;re his son , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
you have his eyes .
ellie clayton .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
and i @-@ i &apos;m still at a loss . i &apos;m sorry .
i can see that .
um ... do you mind telling me how you knew my dad ?
how do you like your coffee ?
when i was a kid , my dad owned a bar .
one night , someone came in to rob it , and he was killed .
your father investigated .
i &apos;m sorry .
he never found who did it ,
but your dad , he stayed in my life .
every few weeks he &apos;d check in ,
and on the anniversary of my father &apos;s death ,
he &apos;d take me to lunch .
we &apos;d get some shave ice and walk on this beach .
it meant a lot to me .
it made a difficult day a little bit easier .
i &apos;ll always be grateful for that .
so , now , on the anniversary of his death ,
i come to pay my respects ,
honor his memory .
when was the last time you guys spoke ?
it was shortly before he died , actually .
he called me to tell me he might have a new lead in the case .
did he say what it was ?
no .
he followed a lot of leads over the years .
none of them ever came to much .
you know , no matter how many setbacks ,
your dad , he never gave up .
yeah .
he was stubborn like that .
oh , i have to run . i &apos;m sorry .
i have to be in court in an hour .
what , you &apos;re a lawyer ?
how do you know i &apos;m not a defendant ?
well , i &apos;ve met a lot of defendants ,
they don &apos;t look like you .
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
deputy prosecutor .
five @-@ o taskforce .
good to know we &apos;re on the same side .
i &apos;m glad i had a chance to meet you .
your dad talked a lot about you .
he was really proud .
well , it was nice to meet you , too , ellie .
hey , ellie .
your dad &apos;s bar , what was the name of it ?
the aces high .
in kapahulu .
that &apos;s right .
what ?
nothing .
i @-@ i remembered is all .
well , good @-@ bye , steve .
bye .
hey , whoa .
what are you guys doing ?
what ?
we &apos;re packing boxes , just like you asked .
with the newspapers ? are you crazy ?
there &apos;s evidence in these pages .
of what ?
several connected global conspiracies i &apos;ve yet to prove .
you got 18 boxes worth of files labeled , like ,
&quot; unexplained phenomena , &quot;
&quot; area 51 . &quot;
you hold on to old vhs tapes ,
along with newspapers .
you know what your problem is , brah ?
you &apos;re the hoarder .
yeah , a hoarder of truth .
jerry , compulsive hoarding is a symptom of ocd .
have you ever been diagnosed ?
oh , yeah , dr. shaw ?
hanging out with dead people all day
could be considered borderline necrophilia .
have you ever been diagnosed ?
denial is another symptom .
what did i say ?
i &apos;m gonna start packing up the kitchen .
what the hell ?
we &apos;re downstairs working , and you &apos;re up here listening to ...
pictorial onlay , fine dust jacket ...
what are you listening to ?
nothing .
book on tape .
you mean bookshop owner on tape .
bookshop owner @-@ slash @-@ counterfeiter .
i don &apos;t believe this . is this live ?
it &apos;s from a few days ago .
i was just catching up between packing boxes .
jerry , are you aware that in the state of hawaii ,
bugging someone is a felony , and carries with it
a $ 10,000 fine and a five @-@ year prison sentence ?
are you aware of the consequences
of flooding the market with counterfeit currency ?
this guy farrow could crash
a small economy if we don &apos;t stop him .
there is nothing to stop .
the secret service already cleared farrow .
secret service ? !
what do they know ? !
they still believe that oswald acted alone .
jerry , enough .
i know for a fact that mcgarrett already asked you
to back off twice .
and you didn &apos;t listen .
how are we supposed to trust you now ?
how &apos;d you even manage to bug this guy ?
pulled a trojan horse move .
hid the bug in a rare book ,
and i sold it to him via a third party .
but don &apos;t ask me who , &apos; cause i &apos;ll never tell .
it was kamekona .
i &apos;ll give you points for creativity .
but you got to get the book back .
and you got to shut this thing down .
crap , it &apos;s mcgarrett . please don &apos;t say anything .
you gonna get the book back ?
fine .
all right .
commander !
dude , i thought you couldn &apos;t make it .
sorry , buddy , i &apos;m not here for the packing party .
i need a word with chin . you got a sec ?
yeah .
what &apos;s up ?
hey , listen . did my dad ever talk about a cold case back in &apos; 95 ?
it was robbery @-@ homicide .
victim &apos;s last name was clayton .
yeah .
yeah , that case haunted him .
i found this in his toolbox .
i never understood why . then this morning i met
clayton &apos;s daughter and it started to make some sense .
apparently , my dad kept in touch with her .
what happened ?
well , there had been a string of robberies in the neighborhood .
and clayton was closing up this place
when the killer came in and shot him in cold blood .
grabbed the cash box and took off .
meanwhile , the daughter was upstairs in the apartment
that they shared when the whole thing happened .
poor kid heard the shot .
what about suspects ? they ever have any suspects ?
yeah , for a minute .
homeless guy .
uh ... ned burrows .
hpd found him during the canvass .
lab tested a sweatshirt he was wearing ,
and it came back with traces of gsr .
he claimed that he found the sweatshirt in a dumpster
a couple blocks from the crime scene .
of course , no one believed him at first .
but then he alibied out .
but after they let him go ,
your dad became convinced
that burrows knew more than he said .
so , he went back into that neighborhood every night
for a month , looking for the guy ,
but never found him .
and over the years , he kept up the search .
the guy was a ghost .
a couple of days before my dad was killed ,
he called paul clayton &apos;s daughter ,
and told her he might have a new lead .
maybe he finally tracked him down .
do me a favor , go to my house ,
go through my dad &apos;s stuff , tapes , journals .
see if you can find anything on burrows .
in the meantime , i &apos;m gonna call the property clerk at hpd
and have them pull up all the evidence .
you want to reopen this case ?
obviously this meant a lot to my dad .
i owe it to him to try to solve it .
would the rhodes scholar like another shirley temple ?
世界级奖学金 有 &quot; 全球本科生诺贝尔奖 &quot; 之称
no , thanks .
it &apos;s only a report card , dad .
hey , don &apos;t be so modest .
you got straight a &apos;s .
your mom would &apos;ve been proud .
you need to take a break .
i &apos;m good .
you work too hard .
you &apos;re gonna burn yourself out .
come on .
get up .
hey . it &apos;s getting late .
what do you say we call it a night ?
all right , you head upstairs , get ready .
i &apos;ll ... finish up down here . i &apos;ll be up soon ..
good night , dad .
ellie ?
i didn &apos;t even think to call for help .
i just ran downstairs , but ...
by the time i got there ,
my father was barely breathing .
i just held his hand .
i kept saying ,
&quot; daddy , please don &apos;t leave me . &quot;
ellie ?
i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m sergeant mcgarrett .
you can call me john , if you like .
i need to ask you some questions ,
if that &apos;s okay .
listen ...
you &apos;re gonna survive this , you know ?
it won &apos;t be easy .
but you can do it .
i &apos;ve , uh ...
i &apos;ve got a daughter about your age .
when things get tough , i say to her ...
... you need to be strong .
you need to be brave .
and if you can do that ,
then you &apos;re gonna be okay .
that lead your father mentioned ?
do you think you might know what he was talking about ?
i have a hunch , but ...
even if i &apos;m right ...
i know .
it could end up being nothing .
it &apos;s one thing you discover early on , as a prosecutor ,
is just how often even the most promising leads fail to pan out .
whatever happens , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , so we looked at all the physical evidence in the case .
and it turns out there wasn &apos;t much .
there were no prints at the scene ,
and no usable dna profiles on the sweatshirt .
what about ballistics ?
well , there was only one bullet fired ,
no shell casing found ,
so more than likely the murder weapon was a revolver .
now , csu did recover some bullet fragments .
but ballistics testing at the time was inconclusive .
all right , have the lab test those fragments again .
technology &apos;s come a long way in the last 20 years .
maybe we &apos;ll get something this time .
yeah , chin ? what do you got ?
looks like you were right about that lead .
what ? my dad was closing in on ned burrows .
yup . turns out that shortly before your father passed ,
hawaii launched a program to issue state i.d. &apos; s to the homeless ,
so they could apply for jobs and services .
your dad checked and found out burrows got one of those i.d. &apos; s ,
which put him in the system .
and once that happened ,
he started leaving a trail .
right , but my father never got the chance to follow it .
you &apos;re right .
but now we can .
all right . here &apos;s the deal .
uh , that sweatshirt ...
wasn &apos;t the only thing i fished out of the dumpster .
what do you mean ?
there was , uh , a metal box
had about $ 350 cash in it
along with a pretty nice watch .
i figure whoever killed the bar guy
stashed the loot and was gonna come back for it later .
all right , when they picked you up , you had the sweatshirt .
what &apos;d you do with everything else ?
i partied .
i spent most of the money on meth .
and then i put the rest back
with the watch and i hid the box
in this old building behind leonard &apos;s bakery .
i figured i &apos;d pawn the watch down the road .
but after the cops let me go ,
i figured it was safer to just forget about it .
see ?
there it is .
what is that ?
i &apos;m not sure .
all right , we &apos;ll get it back to the lab ,
see if we can pull some prints off of it .
学生 艾莉 · 克莱顿
you guys can take him home now .
i told you .
i didn &apos;t have nothing to do with that murder .
this doesn &apos;t add up .
it doesn &apos;t add up .
the night of the murder ,
that neighborhood was a ghost town , all right ?
the hpd response time was seven minutes .
which means the killer had plenty of time
to take the loot and disappear without anybody seeing him
and long before the cops show up . right ?
so why stash it and risk it being found ?
cause i don &apos;t think it had anything to do with the money .
i think the killer took this
to throw the hpd off and make them think it was robbery .
if you &apos;re right , then paul clayton &apos;s murder was pre @-@ meditated .
this was a hit .
ellie , there &apos;s , uh ,
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
we followed up on the lead that my dad had mentioned .
and based on what we found , we no longer think
that your dad &apos;s murder was connected to the robbery .
we actually think he was targeted .
you &apos;re saying someone went there intending to kill him ?
ellie , i need you to think back .
did anything usual happen in the days before the murder ?
did your dad do anything out of character ?
was there any strange behavior ?
there was this one incident .
it was maybe a week before the murder .
i saw my dad arguing with this boy .
jordan .
jordan who ?
you remember his last name ?
lewis , i think--
he was a neighborhood kid-- he was 15 , maybe 16 .
they were arguing behind the bar ,
and it was , it was intense .
i asked my dad what it was about .
but he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
he said it was just a small misunderstanding .
looking back and knowing what i know now ,
it could &apos;ve been more than that .
i need a lawyer here ?
no . no .
we &apos;re just having a conversation .
had a cop say that to me once .
same way , too .
all casual .
conversation ended with me in handcuffs .
paul clayton .
you remember that name ?
he owned a bar called aces high in your old neighborhood .
yeah , i ... i remember him .
got killed in a robbery .
well , that &apos;s the thing .
that was the theory back then , but ...
now we think it might have been premeditated .
yeah , see , a week before the murder ,
he had a big blow @-@ out with paul clayton .
yeah , i see where this is going .
but you &apos;re way off base .
all right , then , set us straight .
you tell us how you selling meth outside of aces high
didn &apos;t put you in conflict with paul clayton .
it did .
but mr. clayton , man , he was ...
he was trying to help me get out .
he wanted me to quit dealing .
he said , if i did , he would ...
he would hook me up with a job .
but i ...
i told him it wasn &apos;t so easy .
it &apos;s not like i was dealing because i wanted to .
my mom was a junkie .
she ... she was in debt to a local dealer named sykes .
i was working off what she owed .
but mr. clayton , man , he ... he didn &apos;t get it .
he ... he thought there was another way .
he didn &apos;t get how things worked .
that &apos;s what we were arguing about , okay ?
man was trying to save my life .
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t kill him .
and if you don &apos;t believe me ...
check my medical records ...
right ?
i got this surfing yoks .
i was at kuakini getting stitched up the night he got murdered .
all right , we &apos;ll check it out .
i liked mr. clayton .
i hope you find the guy that killed him .
hey , danny , it &apos;s me again .
i &apos;m just checking on you , man .
i just want to see how you &apos;re doing ,
and see how the family &apos;s holding up .
look , give me a call if you get a second , all right ?
i &apos;m thinking about you , buddy .
bye .
just got off the phone with the lab .
no usable prints on the cash box .
they also ran ballistics again ,
but came back with the same result .
said that if we had more fragments to test ,
they might have better luck .
your dad really went at this one hard , didn &apos;t he ?
definitely ran down every lead .
yeah , he really wanted to get justice for ellie .
you know , i think that &apos;s why he looked after her the way he did ,
because he never could .
actually , steve ...
i think it was a little more than that .
you know , she &apos;s lucky to have you looking out for her .
she &apos;s just a kid .
she needs people in her life ,
people she can lean on .
you spoken to steve lately ?
been a while .
your dad had some regrets .
but you know what i think his biggest one was ?
sending you and mary away
when you thought your mother had been killed .
i mean ...
he had to , he did that for our safety .
yeah , he did .
but i think he came to believe
it would have been better for you if he hadn &apos;t .
that he should have kept you close ,
been in your lives every day .
hey , so get this .
that card that was in paul clayton &apos;s cash box ,
yeah .
the one with the weird symbol on it ?
well , i checked with the hpd symbol images database ,
and i got a hit .
turns out it was a membership card
to an underground card parlor called the paradise den .
looks like our vic was into gambling ,
maybe he got in too deep .
i remember hearing about this place .
had a reputation for showing no mercy
when it came to people who couldn &apos;t pay up .
we know who ran the operation ?
guy by the name of dominic alonzo .
but you won &apos;t be talking to him ,
because he &apos;s been dead eight years .
that &apos;s helpful .
all right , let &apos;s find somebody who worked for dominic ,
see if they can remember anything
about paul clayton owing money to the house .
i went past your office ,
they , uh , told me you left early .
i figured you might come down here .
can never bring myself to sell this place .
even when i was trying to find money for law school .
how &apos;s the investigation coming ?
i want to show you something . okay ?
do you know what that is ?
no .
we found that card in the cash box that we recovered .
that gave your father access to an underground game room .
ellie , we think it &apos;s possible that your father &apos;s murder
could have been related to illegal gambling .
no , there &apos;s no way .
i know it &apos;s hard to hear .
we all want to think the best of our fathers .
no , it &apos;s not that . look ,
my dad used to gamble .
a lot .
when he was in his 20s , he was a rounder .
that &apos;s how he scraped together enough cash to buy this place .
but i know for a fact
that he quit playing before i was born .
he might have had that card ,
but i don &apos;t believe he ever used it .
maybe business was slow .
you know , maybe he needed cash .
listen , w @-@ we &apos;re still looking into it , okay ?
but in the meantime , there &apos;s something else i want to try .
all right ? with your permission ...
i &apos;d like to exhume your father &apos;s body ,
and have our m.e. perform a second autopsy .
why ?
the bullet that killed your dad , it was shattered , okay ?
and at the time , they only recovered some of the fragments .
which means pieces were either mishandled ,
or they were still in your dad &apos;s body ,
and they simply missed them during that first autopsy .
now , if we can get those other pieces ,
our lab is gonna have a much better chance
at matching ballistics .
look , i can &apos;t imagine how hard this is for you ,
asking you to relive everything ,
having to grieve all over again .
and , ellie , if you want to say no , say no .
that &apos;s okay .
as painful as this is ,
i want to catch the man that took my father away from me .
do what you have to do .

okay , let &apos;s go over the plan one more time .
no need , brah . i know the plan .
don &apos;t get caught wearing a wire .
don &apos;t worry .
i got this .
aloha .
can i help you with anything ?
yeah , my cousin was in here recently .
big guy , looks like me .
only not as handsome .
he sold you a copy of lecanto &apos;s doctrina de homine .
oh , yes . of course .
wonderful copy , splendid condition .
yeah , i need it back .
pardon ?
that book has been in our family for generations .
my cousin had no right to sell it .
he only did it to support his drug habit .
oh , i see .
give you $ 500 for it .
i &apos;m awfully sorry , sir . but ,
you see , that book was sold yesterday .
you crime fighters are in luck .
i put a picture of your vic in front of some card dealers
who worked the paradise den back in &apos; 95 .
turns out one of &apos; em actually remembered the brother .
so , paul clayton , was he a regular there ?
no , just stopped in once .
and your friend remembers him ?
it was a memorable visit .
according to my friend , there was an incident .
he was hazy with the details ,
but apparently your vic got into it
with some card players one night .
and these guys were some serious trouble .
my friend don &apos;t remember names , but
at least two of them was svl .
svl ? what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a samoan street gang .
they had a big presence on the island till the mid- &apos; 90s .
they were pretty vicious .
and definitely not the kind of folks
you want to antagonize .
thanks , buddy .
okay , so we know paul clayton was a card shark .
maybe he was hustling some of these svl guys
and they got wise to him .
all right , so the bullet that killed paul clayton
was matched to a gun that was used
in an attempted homicide five months before paul &apos;s murder .
there were no arrests were made ,
but the primary suspect in the case
was one tony malua .
what do we know about him ?
well , today , he &apos;s a legit businessman
who builds and sells koa furniture .
but in a previous life ,
he was a known svl member
who served time for aggravated assault .
malua &apos;s name came up
in some old hpd vice reports
as someone who frequented many of oahu &apos;s illegal gaming rooms ,
including paradise den .
i think we may have found our killer .
let &apos;s go .
hey ! what the hell &apos;s this all about ?
why don &apos;t you take a look ?
who &apos;s that ?
oh , you don &apos;t recognize him , huh ?
sit down .
kapahulu . 19 years ago .
you turned this man &apos;s daughter into an orphan .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i don &apos;t know that haole .
you and that haole got into it at the paradise den .
jog your memory ?
and now it all comes back .
okay , look . that wasn &apos;t me .
stop ! we got the bullet , all right ?
and it came from your gun .
all right , fine .
i don &apos;t deny it ,
but i didn &apos;t pull that trigger .
really ? we must &apos;ve made a mistake .
i swear ! on my life .
it was my man sykes who shot that guy .
i just gave him the piece .
hang on .
sykes ?
yeah .
it was him who got into it with the haole , not me .
they was arguing over some corner boy .
start at the beginning .
the haole came into the paradise with five large .
told sykes he &apos;d play heads @-@ up poker with him
for the kid &apos;s freedom , so they did .
and then the guy took sykes down .
humiliated him in front of everybody .
sykes got pissed .
right as it was about to get physical ,
the pit boss threw the haole out for his own safety . but
sykes , he just got angrier .
couldn &apos;t let it go .
all right , so here &apos;s what i have on sykes , first name jimmy .
he &apos;s a former ice pusher ,
owns a club in chinatown .
okay , well , given what jordan told us ,
i think we all believe that malua &apos;s telling the truth , right ?
i think we got a problem .
all we got is malua &apos;s word .
short of finding the murder weapon
with sykes &apos;s prints on it ,
how do we prove this guy &apos;s our killer ?
i got an idea .
what do you guys want now ?
you said you hoped we &apos;d catch paul clayton &apos;s killer .
how &apos;d you like to help us do it ?
doors open at 9 : 00 , bro .
yeah . i came here to see jimmy .
he expecting you ?
just tell him ,
jordan lewis came to say hello .
i don &apos;t care . all right ?
you tell him
whatever you &apos;re gonna tell him .
i don &apos;t care . all right ?
just don &apos;t bother me anymore .
wow , this i had to see .
what &apos;s up , j ?
look at you .
you were a scrawny little kid last time i saw you .
now you &apos;re all shredded .
but i guess there ain &apos;t much to do
inside but hit the iron .
yeah , man , it &apos;s all there is .
go .
so when &apos;d you get out ?
couple days ago .
so what brings you here ?
i was looking for work .
you know , thought maybe you could--
hook you up with a job .
yeah .
and why would i do that ?
because you know me , man .
you can trust me .
you know that .
i could trust you when you were a little kid .
cause i owned your mom .
but that was then .
look , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll take anything , man .
right ? i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
yeah , but what can you do ?
you spent half your adult life inside .
what skills have you got
that have any value in the real world ?
why would i help you ?
cause you owe me .
i owe you ? for what ?
keeping my mouth shut all these years .
slow down , kid . you &apos;re gonna spook him .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
talking about paul clayton .
remember him ?
guy you killed for no reason ?
oh , you think i didn &apos;t know about that ?
no , i knew that was you all along ,
yet said nothing .
&quot; no reason &quot; ?
guy was messing with my business .
i did what had to be done .
in fact , if you think about it ,
you &apos;re the reason that he &apos;s dead .
you got him killed .
so , what , now you think that
your silence is worth something ?
like a job ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe you could sweep up the place ...
let &apos;s go ! go , go , go !
that man was the only person
that ever gave a damn about me !
you son of a bitch .
he saw something good in me .
thought i could do better !
he had a little girl !
sit down . sit !
i got him . get down on the ground ! get down .
on the floor ! on the floor !
got it !
we need a paramedic .
somebody get me a paramedic .
call a paramedic .
i &apos;m sorry .
couldn &apos;t help myself .
hey , steve ...
you hand me that wrench ?
thanks , buddy .
all right .
okay ...
i &apos;m gonna hold that one ...
see that ?
all right .
nice work .
you need a hand ?
i was just on my way to the hospital to see jordan , but
i wanted to stop by first and say thank you .
in person .
you &apos;re welcome .
you , uh , having some trouble with your differential ?
yes , i am , actually .
i just put new gaskets and seals in ,
but she &apos;s still running rough .
try new bearings and thrust washers , that should fix it .
you know something about cars ?
no , not really .
i know a few things about this car , though .
actually , i rode in it a couple of times .
your dad loved to talk about this car .
yeah , he certainly did .
he did . hey , i appreciate the tip .
happy to help .
let me ask you a question :
do you know how to fix the intake manifold leak ?
because that one has been stumping me for years .
sorry . i wish i did .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll figure it out one of these days .
i should really get going .
yeah , yeah , sure . of course .
yeah .
am i gonna see you at the national memorial next year ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be there .
all right .
hope it won &apos;t be that long
before we see each other again , though .
me , too .
hello , mr. ortega .
what are you doing here ?
returning your book .
did you ever read it ?
no ?
there &apos;s a passage in here
that warns of the perils of meddling
in someone else &apos;s affairs .
&quot; he who does will face retribution . &quot;
