congratulations , blake , you just finished that crossword puzzle
in 7 minutes .
i mean , you could do it , too .
i &apos;ve done it in 5.1 / 2 , actually .
there &apos;s a theory about pattern recognition
where you don &apos;t even have to look at the clues anymore ,
but i found that going across instead of down helps
because the sequence of saccades
and fixations in traditional reading
assist with other oculomotor tasks
such as solving crossword puzzles .
happy wednesday , my nerds .
hey , you &apos;re here early .
well , apparently not early enough .
i missed all the excitement .
you do that in pen ?
is there any other way ?
where &apos;s hotch ?
in there with garcia .
everything ok ?
we &apos;ll see .
10 letters , starts with &quot; c. &quot;
cabalistic ?
indeed .
oi ! let &apos;s do this .
hi . good morning . no real time to get comfortable .
an hour ago , the man on your tablets
was found wandering the streets of baltimore before he collapsed .
he is unconscious , he has no i.d. on him ,
so we don &apos;t know his name .
he &apos;s got ligature marks on his wrists ,
and it &apos;s impossible to tell how long he &apos;s been missing .
are those puncture wounds in the corner of his eyes ?
yes , and an mri confirmed
that fibers in his brain had been severed .
he had a lobotomy ?
there was hemorrhaging and foreign object splinters
imbedded behind his right eye .
most likely from whatever tool the unsub used .
my guess would be an icepick .
the guy &apos;s still alive . can we talk to him ?
you should try .
someone with such a specific m.o.
has probably done this before .
we just don &apos;t know about it yet .
it &apos;s all being run through vicap .
yes , it is .
the entry points in his eyes
are from an outpatient @-@ style traditional lobotomy .
less mess than drilling holes like dahmer did .
and dahmer &apos;s method killed . this didn &apos;t .
so either the unsub is lucky or he has medical training .
he wanted his victim to survive .
we need to canvass the area where he was found .
he wouldn &apos;t have walked very far in this condition .
well , lobotomies are considered to be the surgery of the soul .
doctors like walter freeman claimed
they could cure a number of mental illnesses .
he believed the procedure could relieve suffering .
excuse me , agent hotchner .
yes , sir .
agent cruz is here .
oh . everyone , this is our new section chief .
this is agent mateo cruz .
these are agents blake--
blake , dr. reid , morgan ,
jareau , and rossi .
good to officially meet you .
oh , and penelope garcia .
erin strauss always spoke very highly of you .
oh . thank you .
i spoke to the baltimore office .
seems like they &apos;re at a loss .
when the identity of the victim is unknown ,
it makes everything that much harder .
i &apos;d like to join you .
it &apos;s not every day
that these cases take you an hour away from home , so ...
we leave in 20 minutes .
you could have mentioned this .
i thought you liked surprises .
seriously , i got word minutes after we had breakfast .
28 ... 29 ...
2010--
wait , that &apos;s not right .
great , you &apos;re awake .
i &apos;m dr. hoshino .
you &apos;re at chesapeake general .
i need to talk to the police .
i just heard the fbi is coming .
good . when will they get here ?
can you turn those down ? it &apos;s hot .
how are you doing ?
my head hurts worse than it was .
can you just ...
thanks , that &apos;s better .
you have an i.v. to keep you hydrated .
and i &apos;ve prescribed propofol to help with any discomfort .
good , &apos; cause my head &apos;s gonna explode .
can you take this thing off ?
yes , doctor .
get that started .
please , turn those down . it &apos;s too bright .
wait , what &apos;s going on ?
can you hear me ?
wh @-@ where are you going ?
can you hear me ? !
&quot; someone i loved once gave me a box full of darkness .
it took me years to understand that this , too , was a gift . &quot;
mary oliver .
a lobotomy is supposed to alter a patient &apos;s personality .
but it &apos;s hard to know if that &apos;s what he was trying to do
since the victim &apos;s a john doe .
when it &apos;s used for torture ,
it &apos;s about complete power and control over the victim .
jeffrey dahmer fantasized about men
and he put battery acid in their brains
so they couldn &apos;t escape .
all because he was lonely , right ?
yeah , extremely deranged sexual urges ,
irrational fantasies , and psychopathic tendencies .
looks like the victim is in his mid @-@ 20s
but no one matching his description
as been reported missing in the tri @-@ state area .
well , if he &apos;s been arrested before ,
his prints will be in the database .
the locals are running them now .
well , it &apos;s no accident the unsub chose a victim
who won &apos;t be missed .
but if he &apos;s so meticulous in his hunting ,
how did he let his victim escape ?
interesting .
what &apos;s it say ?
cruz has risen through the ranks .
it looks like he spent most of his time at headquarters .
blue @-@ flamer .
being our section chief
could be a two @-@ year steppingstone for him .
so he hasn &apos;t been in the field , but he wants to now ?
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
come on , it was the same thing with strauss .
we don &apos;t need a babysitter out here .
well , that &apos;s not how she saw it .
she just wanted to see the team in action .
look , all due respect to strauss , and you know that , rossi ,
i just don &apos;t like it .
if you want a desk job , then sit at your desk .
jeez , tell us what you really think .
you ever heard of this cruz guy ?
yeah , but we never crossed paths . you ?
nope .
jj ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;ve heard his name .
he &apos;s been in and out of consciousness .
i &apos;ve had to stabilize his head ,
given the extent of the injuries .
he &apos;s sedated to help with the pain .
but don &apos;t those meds cause amnesia ?
sometimes . but i don &apos;t have a choice .
without the pain medicine , he &apos;ll be miserable .
it sure wear off in the next few hours .
do you think he understands what &apos;s happening ?
part of me hopes he doesn &apos;t ,
but , yeah , i think so .
thanks , doctor .
my name is derek morgan . i &apos;m with the fbi .
can you tell me your name ?
sam carter .
look , you gotta help me .
i &apos;m probably not the first person to ask you that , am i ?
more like the tenth .
there are ways to figure things out without words .
i &apos;d like to try that with you , ok ?
ok .
for example , can you blink if you understand ?
would that work for you ?
blink once if it does .
ok .
perfect .
do you know who did this ?
no .
was it a man ?
yes .
ok .
was he working alone ?
yes .
do you know where he kept you ?
some dump near harford road .
right . i &apos;m sorry .
just give me a piece of paper . i &apos;ll write it down .
what are you trying to say ? do you want to write ?
do you want to write something ?
it &apos;s gotta be faster than this .
here .
harford road .
there were a bunch of warehouses .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
that &apos;s not what i wrote .
look , the person who did this to you
messed up your ability to talk ,
but we &apos;re gonna get through it , all right ?
what happened to me ?
what &apos;s happening ?
ok , here .
i need you to try and stay calm ,
but i can show you what you look like if you want .
you sure you want to see ?
yeah . show me .
oh , my god .
the victim was found just after dawn .
it could mean the unsub has a job
that requires him to leave early .
my guess is his social skills are lacking ,
and that &apos;ll be reflected in his type of work .
s.a.c. is in the field
but called to say whatever you need , you got it .
the recovery site &apos;s surrounded by abandoned warehouses .
he needs the desolation to enforce his power and control .
there &apos;s a team looking through the buildings now .
this unsub doesn &apos;t leave anything to luck .
there was a garbage truck that sticks to a schedule .
hey , hotch .
did you talk to the driver ?
yeah , according to him ,
the victim looked and sounded like a zombie .
there &apos;s no way he made it far .
most of the buildings down here are boarded up .
we &apos;re starting with the closest one .
the victim was in such bad shape ,
he probably didn &apos;t walk the stairs by himself .
he was either held on the first floor
and luckily made it out ...
or he didn &apos;t escape at all .
the unsub let him go .
come on , stay with me .
i &apos;m just so tired .
let me get this right .
he &apos;s working alone ?
yes .
but what ?
was it more than one of you there ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to tell you .
we gotta figure out another way to do this .
my eyes are killing me .
was it another guy ?
no .
was it a girl ?
yes .
do you know her ?
yes , i know her .
dana ? dana !
dana ...
here &apos;s where he held him .
why would he let this guy go ?
he wants him to suffer .
what the hell is that ?
adult diapers .
medical soap .
toothbrushes .
he took care of this victim .
only to ensure he &apos;d stay alive .
this looks small .
why would he leave these behind ?
cause he wants us to know something .
hotch , the unsub also had a female victim .
they ran the victim &apos;s prints ,
but he wasn &apos;t in any database .
he doesn &apos;t have any track marks ,
and the tox screen is clean .
this isn &apos;t the kind of guy
who would hang out in that neighborhood .
it rules out the high @-@ risk behavior theory ,
but it doesn &apos;t answer why he wouldn &apos;t be missed .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on right now .
what 20 @-@ something nowadays wouldn &apos;t be missed ?
i mean , with social media alone , there &apos;s constant contact .
what &apos;s this ?
over 50 universities in the state ,
50 more if you add d.c. and virginia .
the students are the most socially active of all .
why aren &apos;t we looking into someone
with a more isolated existence ?
the low @-@ risk behavior of the victim
tells us a lot about his lifestyle .
he might stalk the most isolated victims
knowing that they won &apos;t be missed .
that &apos;s smart . campuses are a great place to blend in ,
and all of those schools look within a two @-@ hour drive .
go ahead , garcia .
there are over 100,000 kids enrolled in maryland colleges alone ,
another hundred in northern virginia and the district .
all right , send out a photo of the victim to all the campuses .
somebody &apos;s going to recognize him .
and , sir , i did that search through vicap .
nothing in the states .
so i figured it &apos;d be ok to cast a wider net ,
and i asked a brilliant ex @-@ coworker of ours ,
and guess what--emily found a single incident on interpol .
it looked like a one @-@ hit wonder until now .
where ?
berlin .
germany ?
germany ? what about germany ?
a male victim .
come here . come here .
come here .
hotch , i gotta go .
does germany mean something to you ?
dana lived there . yes .
yes , it means something .
ok , this is good . we &apos;re getting somewhere .
doc , when he &apos;s awake , he definitely knows what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;d like you to get me a communication board .
i want to get him to spell some things out .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;ll get one in here .
i &apos;m just checking your eyes again .
the swelling &apos;s gone down .
cranial nerves and pupil reflex looks normal ,
considering the trauma .
this isn &apos;t right .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ? what do you see ?
open your eyes wide as you can .
the doctor &apos;s gonna see if he can remove the camera .
he was blinking the whole time . it &apos;s how he communicated ,
but i don &apos;t know how i didn &apos;t see this sooner .
the eye is the most confined space in the body ,
which means the camera &apos;s probably 3 to 4 millimeters long
and difficult to see without a microscopic lens .
is it a prosthetic eye ?
no . it &apos;s right next to the pupil .
that must be the unidentified splinter the mri showed .
it &apos;s an ocular nano @-@ implant .
all right , thanks . garcia &apos;s searching for the transmission
but it &apos;s bouncing all over the city .
they &apos;re usually controlled by cell phone ,
which needs to be within a specific distance , so he &apos;s close .
i know they &apos;ve developed the technology ,
but it isn &apos;t widely known .
actually it is , if you know who to call .
everything &apos;s on the black market .
it &apos;s expensive but not high @-@ tech .
should we be looking at micro surgeons ?
there &apos;s no need .
the camera itself is smaller than the point of a needle .
that &apos;s usually how they inject it .
that &apos;s weird .
he fancied an old @-@ fashioned technique for the lobotomy ,
but the camera tells us that he &apos;s technically inclined .
what about this german victim ? how does he tie in ?
the m.e. report says that he survived the lobotomy
but was later shot in the head .
why ?
he was a test run for the current victim .
once the theory was proved he was no longer needed .
did he install a camera in that victim &apos;s eye , too ?
no .
there &apos;s something special about this guy .
where did their paths cross ?
garcia &apos;s compiling a list of foreign exchange students .
that should be a more manageable number .
you would think so , but d.c. has the highest concentration
of exchange students in the nation ,
which means we &apos;re still looking at tens of thousands .
and we &apos;re also running facial recognition on student visas .
that &apos;s all good , but now what ?
we figure out why he &apos;s doing it .
this escalation could be the unsub &apos;s message
about the eyes being windows to the soul .
there &apos;s something to that .
the same genes that develop the iris
also shape the frontal lobe ,
which influences personality .
why is this part of his ritual now but it wasn &apos;t in berlin ?
well , that &apos;s unclear , but his first kill in berlin
means he has a significant connection there .
he &apos;s likely visiting the u.s. and he feels out of place .
and that may be how he connected with his victims .
he &apos;s definitely had medical training .
his german victim was a student ,
and the unsub may also be in those circles .
we need to check currently enrolled medical students
as well as recent dropouts , both here and abroad .
he &apos;s clearly bright and capable .
his torture suggests he &apos;s experimenting ,
which could mean he &apos;s bored .
but with his intelligence comes a dark side .
and that &apos;s where his psychology and genetics come into play .
how do you know those characteristics ?
we can only speculate , but if his victims do represent him ,
then he &apos;s telling us that
he feels lobotomized and powerless .
this could mean he was raised in a strict home
or one where he didn &apos;t have a voice .
do you think he was heavily medicated or institutionalized ?
maybe . a majority of the lobotomy patients
in the 1940s were mentally ill
and resided in state @-@ run institutions .
the doctors there felt they were providing mercy to the patients ,
but the use of the camera tells us
that this unsub wants his victims to suffer .
and the emotional torture of being left paralyzed
is a kind of overkill ,
and that occurs when there &apos;s a personal connection
between the offender and the victims .
he wants them to suffer , but he also wants to witness
what it &apos;s like to be them .
he &apos;s given himself a front @-@ row seat .
and now that he knows we &apos;re on the case ,
that kind of attention could cause him to escalate .
how so ?
he may want us to see what he sees .
so what did he say when you asked
if there was a woman held with him ?
he didn &apos;t say a word .
the guy &apos;s brain got scrambled .
i can &apos;t imagine knowing what &apos;s going on
but not being able to say anything .
i know he &apos;s only got minimal gestures ,
but did he give you any indication he knew her ?
just shut his eyes , the same way he did
when he realized he was paralyzed .
well , that &apos;s definitely a sign .
an emotional one .
well , if we say we have a missing couple
and we put his photo around campuses ,
we might be able to figure out who she is , too .
any word on the camera ?
doctor &apos;s checking the x @-@ rays now
to see if he can get it out .
if it &apos;s the nano @-@ tech i think it is ,
removing the piece could be dangerous for the victim .
at the very least he could lose his eye .
you &apos;ve seen this stuff before .
not quite like this ,
but it &apos;s used for foreign counterintelligence .
so then where did he get it ?
it &apos;s like back @-@ alley lasik .
you &apos;re kidding me .
we should just shut his eyes .
show &apos;s over .
or we could play his game .
they can &apos;t take it out .
not yet .
or i &apos;ll die , right ?
so why don &apos;t we try to focus
on something that we can control , all right ?
i &apos;m going to point to some rows ,
and i want you to tell me if the letter that you need is in it .
what &apos;s your name ?
sam .
first row .
second row .
third .
yes .
ok . ok , that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
yes .
&quot; s &quot; ?
yes .
what &apos;s the second letter ?
&quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a. &quot;
ok .
s @-@ a ...
sam .
sam c. i know he hasn &apos;t spelled his whole name yet ,
but here he is .
what have you got , garcia ?
victim &apos;s name is sam carter ,
and he &apos;s a grad student at ...
johns hopkins .
this is great , sam . you &apos;re doing really great .
who is the woman that was with you ?
dana .
ok .
no , &quot; d. &quot;
no .
&quot; d. &quot;
yes .
ok .
&quot; d. &quot;
what &apos;s the second letter ?
yes .
&quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a. &quot;
ok . d @-@ a ...
now the third letter .
no , second row .
yes .
ok .
it &apos;s &quot; n , &quot; come on .
&quot; n , &quot; yes .
&quot; n. &quot; ok .
d @-@ a @-@ n ...
keep going , sam .
first row .
&quot; a. &quot;
sam .
the medicine &apos;s making me so drowsy .
&quot; i &quot; ? dani ?
no .
is it danielle ?
i meant &quot; a , &quot; not &quot; i. &quot; it &apos;s d @-@ a @-@ n @-@ a .
go up a row .
we &apos;re gonna look for all the danis that we can .
but i need you to save your strength for this next part .
what next part ?
what now ?
we &apos;re gonna try to talk to him through you .
just get dana . don &apos;t let this happen to dana .
yes , yes , talk to him .
now , are you sure that you don &apos;t know him ?
i don &apos;t know him . i &apos;m sure .
ok . just bear with me .
sam , the person who did this to you
is challenging us , so sometimes we have to bluff .
i don &apos;t think he can hear us , but he &apos;s definitely watching .
no , no , sam , sam . come on--
sam !
i know you &apos;re tired .
but i need you to try and keep your eyes open .
cheese .
kevin , i cannot talk right now . i &apos;m swamped .
do you see it ?
yes , i saw that you sent me email ,
morgan &apos;s everywhere .
but i can &apos;t read it right--
you gotta look .
wait , what ?
what do you mean , morgan ?
i gotta go .
the unsub is posting us on the web .
yeah , we &apos;re seeing it , too .
i can &apos;t shut it down . it &apos;s going viral .
it &apos;s streaming all over the globe .
hey , rossi .
ok , we got it .
sam , close your eyes .
what &apos;s going on ?
what ? why ?
the unsub &apos;s posting this .
where ?
all over the world--live .
sam , close your eyes .
oh , god .
you said he wanted us to see .
so why not go to the media ? why the internet ?
the media edits the message . the internet doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s calling our bluff .
if we know who he is , we should come and get him .
use that board again .
it &apos;s d @-@ a @-@ n @-@ a .
please , pick it up .
sam , i know it &apos;s hard ,
but you gotta keep your eyes closed .
just find her .
don &apos;t let them do this to dana .
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god . oh , god .
there &apos;s light coming from above .
the ceiling &apos;s low . it could be a basement .
what &apos;s he doing ?
taunting us .
6 locks on the inside .
he &apos;s barricading them in .
we know what he looks like .
we have not found him in any database yet .
i want all of your agents to spread out
and comb a 5 @-@ mile radius from the hospital
where sam carter was found .
yes , sir .
all right .
i told the director you &apos;re doing everything you can .
do you want me to get a joint taskforce started ?
if garcia can &apos;t shut the site down ,
i don &apos;t think anybody can .
if this woman dies on the internet
and we didn &apos;t do everything in our power to save her--
we &apos;ve got agents who know this city best in the field .
my team is doing everything we can .
you do what you have to do .
this guy doesn &apos;t seem to care
that we know what he looks like .
it &apos;s like he wants to get caught .
he does .
he waited till we were all watching
to lobotomize this girl . why ?
because he &apos;s punishing her , and he wants everyone to see it .
garcia , you can &apos;t block it ?
he &apos;s got multiple @-@ core servers .
come on , baby girl . i know you can shut this thing down .
i am trying my hardest .
it is no joke . it &apos;s a premium network
bounced between germany , denmark , indonesia ,
panama , and the u.s. , and his firewall is hard @-@ core .
well , can you at least figure out the u.s. angle ?
i am trying as hard as i can .
nothing he &apos;s doing has a sexual component ,
that we know of , anyway .
if he wanted to kill sam , he had every chance to do it ,
but instead he let sam go .
both of these victims are significant to him .
it looks like he &apos;s playing a game ,
not just with us , but with all of them .
if it isn &apos;t sexual but still has incredible stakes to him ,
maybe it &apos;s familial . i mean , he could be related to one of them .
he &apos;s not just punishing her , he &apos;s torturing her family .
he has her in a straitjacket .
what &apos;s that about ?
this message is personally specific .
she restrained and emotionally paralyzed .
she &apos;s in no condition to run away .
so those locks are to keep others out .
because he &apos;s in another bad area .
probably close to where he kept them before .
garcia , we need the location
of every cell tower where the signal &apos;s bouncing .
that &apos;s a lot , sir , but i &apos;m sending them now .
what about the name dani ? does it cross with sam in any way ?
there &apos;s a dana harris .
it &apos;s not dani , but he &apos;s called dana harris
a dozen times ,
and she is on a student visa at johns hopkins ,
and , oh , my god , she &apos;s from berlin .
does she have any connection to baltimore other than school ?
digging ... yes , yes . her father is a partner
at strauss and harris commercial real estate .
they specialize in converting
warehouses in port cities all over they world .
they own one in northern baltimore .
and wouldn &apos;t you know it ?
there &apos;s a cell phone tower right by there
that that signal is bouncing from .
what &apos;s the address ?
sending it to your phones now .
there she is . that &apos;s definitely dana .
i &apos;ve got eyes on her . she &apos;s getting into a white van .
do we have cross streets ?
not yet . but it looks like she &apos;s in an alley .
why would he want us to see where they &apos;re going ?
because he &apos;s arrogant .
this is the end of his plan and we &apos;re a part of it .
garcia , we think the unsub could be related to sam or dana .
the harris family has a son , anton , 29 .
history of violent outbursts
had him bouncing between boarding schools all over europe .
while dana stayed close to home .
how &apos;d you know ?
he blames dana for his rejection and abandonment issues .
it &apos;s a classic universal wound .
left untreated and combined with the psychopathic urges ,
that trauma led to extreme aggression .
and a desperate need for attention .
let me guess , garcia-- one of the parents is a medical doctor .
mom was before she died .
it looks like young anton was studying to be a veterinarian .
little sister trumped him by attending medical school at hopkins .
he did all this to get on his parents &apos; radar .
how long has anton been in the states ?
a month into his 3 @-@ month visa .
he waited until dana was away from the family before he attacked .
all right , we got the van . it &apos;s parked in the alley
behind greenmount at 25th .
he &apos;s gone .
this isn &apos;t good .
all right . let &apos;s split up and search the building .
cruz , come with me .
hands where i can see them .
i will if you answer something .
it doesn &apos;t work like that . show me your hands .
hands !
aren &apos;t you the one who &apos;s supposed to ask me
why i do what i do ?
i would if i didn &apos;t already know .
you &apos;re patient , but you also take risks .
it &apos;s why you leave nothing to chance .
i wondered why you hadn &apos;t practiced on the eyes
of the man you killed in berlin .
it &apos;s because you &apos;d already tried it on yourself .
you &apos;re recording all of this right now ,
because you want everyone out there to know what it &apos;s like to be you .
maybe they &apos;ll understand .
maybe they &apos;ll even feel sorry for you .
but they won &apos;t .
because we &apos;ve intercepted your transmission
and shut it down .
go ahead , see for yourself .
so they aren &apos;t watching me anymore .
what else is new ?
my father sent me away because i humiliated him .
he said i brought shame to our family .
your father sent you away because you &apos;re sick
and he wanted to protect dana .
he was right . but he couldn &apos;t stop me .
your father &apos;s on his way . but of course you knew that .
that &apos;s why you showed everyone your face .
you wanted him to know that you &apos;d won .
and it worked .
but you have to admit ,
what i &apos;ve done is extraordinary .
my father will never forget it .
certainly dana won &apos;t .
or maybe she will .
will you ?
i already have .
cuff him .
garcia didn &apos;t shut down his signal , did she ?
well , he didn &apos;t know that .
i can see why they didn &apos;t want you out of the field .
yes , sir , right away . get her on now !
cruz .
copy that .
he &apos;s driving back with us .
you &apos;re getting stronger .
i knew you would .
can you guys hold up for a second ?
yes , sir .
hey , dana . i &apos;m derek .
sam here is very happy to see you .
d @-@ dana .
her vitals are strong .
i should have her back in an hour .
you want to go with her , don &apos;t you , sam ?
yes .
you got it .
they gonna be ok ?
maybe .
eventually .
worst case of sibling rivalry i &apos;ve ever seen .
yeah .
do you have kids ?
no .
do you ?
yes .
my father named me anton
because it means &quot; invaluable . &quot;
do you think he ever believed that ?
why don &apos;t you ask him ?
i will .
you sure about that ?
absolutely . come on , it &apos;s not a problem .
&quot; death is not the greatest loss in life .
the greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live . &quot;
norman cousins .
mr. harris has diplomatic connections
and wanted to have anton extradited .
after all that he &apos;s still trying to protect him .
tell me you didn &apos;t let that happen .
i called in a favor from the state department .
he &apos;s being charged and tried right here .
good .
you got a good team .
we do .
welcome .
thanks .
you always here this late ?
pretty much , yeah .
every time your name was mentioned today
and every time i didn &apos;t say ,
hey , yeah , i know him , i &apos;m lying .
i know it &apos;s not easy . i don &apos;t like it either .
we &apos;re surrounded by profilers , matt .
one side glance and they &apos;re gonna figure it all out .
well , separating us in the field was smart .
it was the only way .
look , i -- i know why we can &apos;t tell them .
i get that , but ...
we can &apos;t have too many of these conversations either .
that case could stay open for a couple years .
it &apos;s already been almost 3 .
did you take this position because of me ?
no .
trust me , i walked into the hoover building this morning
and was told to drive out to quantico immediately .
so someone put this transfer on the fast track .
state ?
they wouldn &apos;t admit it if they did .
true .
this , um ... us ...
we &apos;re good , right ?
yeah .
ok .
you want to meet at the air and space in the morning ,
run some sprints ?
i &apos;m going to make breakfast for my boys .
great plan .
going home ?
yeah .
cruz ?
i &apos;ve got some work to do . good night .
good night .
good night .
good night .
you good ?
