第六集
arthur knows we freed merlin and he &apos;s really not happy about it .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you , emma .
take this traitor to the dungeon where he belongs .
the crimson crown .
it &apos;s used to communicate through magical barriers .
we must &apos;ve been trying to communicate with merlin .
can you free emma from the darkness ?
sure .
how long do you think you can hold my heart and threaten me ?
as long as it takes for me to get what i want .
the only one who can get me that sword is you .
i can &apos;t be the hero you want .
what are you doing ?
reminding you what you have to fight for .
not bad for a bloke who spent the last thousand years in a tree .
just like riding a bike .
well , it won &apos;t be long before arthur knows we &apos;re here .
how do you know what a bike is ?
do you really think all my prophecies
came true because of luck ?
this way .
bloody hell .
you really can see the future .
bits and pieces , yeah .
charming ?
it &apos;s okay .
mary margaret and i are no longer under arthur &apos;s control .
how did you break his thrall over you ?
they didn &apos;t , mate .
i did .
merlin .
what about me , now ? you here to free me , too ?
merida ?
how did you end up in there ?
long story .
but after what your daughter did to me ,
letting me out is the least you can do .
aye . she &apos;s right .
em would want us to free her .
indeed , but much has changed in the past millennia .
these bars are enchanted with magic
that i &apos;ve never encountered before .
here .
try this .
well , aren &apos;t you the clever one ?
glad someone noticed .
we best get going .
no , wait ! wait , i can &apos;t leave !
arthur took my wisps !
they &apos;re the only way i can find my brothers .
right now those wisps will only lead you to one thing ...
your death .
i assure you , we will find another way
to rescue your brothers .
we found merlin back in camelot ?
emma let it slip last night when she tried to visit henry .
if we found that sorcerer ,
why the bloody hell didn &apos;t he destroy the darkness in emma ?
you &apos;re asking the wrong person .
well , we can &apos;t very well ask him .
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re going to do .
a crimson crown .
you figured out how to make the communication spell work .
let &apos;s just say seeing emma rip violet &apos;s heart
from her chest
gave me all the motivation i need .
how does this thing work ? do we simply speak to it ?
it &apos;s not that easy .
not just anyone can summon merlin .
he &apos;ll only appear to someone who &apos;s been chosen by him .
arthur . merlin delivered all the prophecies to him .
so what do you say , sheriff ?
already on my way .
wait , wait .
why are we wasting our time with merlin
when there &apos;s someone here who can help us ?
who ?
rumple .
if he hadn &apos;t brought the darkness back to storybrooke ,
we wouldn &apos;t even be standing here right now .
rumple may be to blame for the situation we &apos;re in ,
but so is emma .
she was seduced by the darkness just like he was ,
so how does that make rumple any different ?
sorry , love . crocodile had more chances than anyone .
and right now we need to give emma her best chance ,
which means contacting merlin .
and something bad happens to rumple ...
it &apos;s a risk we &apos;ll have to take .
well , maybe you &apos;re willing to .
i &apos;m not .
forgive me , belle .
saw you back there . you &apos;re not half bad with magic .
if i was half as good as you ,
i would never have ended up in that dungeon in the first place .
why were you down there ?
after i parted ways with the lot of you ,
i followed the will o &apos; the wisps
to find where the clans are keeping my brothers .
the wisps led me to the ivory sea ,
so i stole a boat to make the crossing ,
but , unfortunately , the boat belonged to the wrong fella .
what , arthur ?
his men captured me and threw me in that dank prison .
did you hear that ?
hear what ?
nothing .
i just ... needed your friends to get out of sight .
what ? w @-@ why ?
so they don &apos;t see this .
i &apos;ve pushed him as hard as i can .
he &apos;s at the end of his tether .
you were saying ?
oh , go ahead . crush it .
better that than helping you with your dirty work .
why would i do that when your job isn &apos;t finished yet ?
what are you on about ?
how am i supposed to train him when he &apos;s not even here ?
you confirmed the one thing i needed to know ...
belle &apos;s still someone he &apos;s willing to fight for .
well , it didn &apos;t exactly make him a hero , now , did it ?
it will ...
... if he wants to stop you .
stop me ? from what ?
killing belle .
now go find her and put an arrow through her heart .
i was beginning to worry you might not wake up .
where are you taking me ?
you got fire . i like that .
but i don &apos;t mean to hurt you .
tell that to the bump on my head .
without the wisps ,
i need another way to find my brothers ,
and that other way ...
is you .
yeah , you needed magic , you could have just asked .
what , and risked getting a no ?
sorry , but i &apos;m more of a &quot; hit first , ask questions later &quot; kind of lass .
ah , is that why the clans kidnapped your brothers ?
hardly .
those kilted oafs don &apos;t think i can rule the highlands
without marrying one of them .
i &apos;m not gonna marry someone i don &apos;t fancy
just to hold on to me own crown .
after my father &apos;s death , they exiled my mother ,
then kidnapped my brothers as ransom .
they &apos;ll only free them if i relinquish the throne .
and you don &apos;t plan on doing that .
would you give up everything you have ever dreamed of
just because a man said you didn &apos;t deserve it ?
so , what do you say ?
will you help me show the clans
they messed with the wrong queen ?
now , where is she keeping you ?
don &apos;t hurt me , don &apos;t hurt me ! please !
please .
it &apos;s okay . dear , it &apos;s just me .
it &apos;s okay .
belle ?
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s just me .
it really you ?
yeah .
she &apos;s after me .
wait , wait .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re safe now .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
god , belle .
thank you .
what ?
i meant ...
i meant when -- when i -- when i was in the coma ...
all i wanted to do was let go .
after all i &apos;d done , why did i deserve to live ?
and then i heard something ...
... your voice .
after all the things i &apos;ve done to you ...
you still stood by me .
belle .
if it wasn &apos;t for you ,
i wouldn &apos;t even be alive .
thank you .
‭ come on .
you know , it won &apos;t take emma long
to figure out where you &apos;ve gone .
if she wanted to find me , she would have already .
she wanted me to escape .
but th @-@ that doesn &apos;t make sense .
she kidnapped you .
to turn me into a hero
so i can pull excalibur from the stone .
well , so how does letting you escape do that ?
she &apos;s coming after you .
me ? w @-@ why ?
to force me to protect you .
she thinks that &apos;ll make me the hero she needs .
belle , you &apos;re in danger .
okay .
so ... so what do we do ?
the shop .
there &apos;s magic there that can help us .
there &apos;s magic in there that can help us .
we can use it to find my brothers .
you sure that the witch isn &apos;t home ?
no .
and what does it matter ?
we &apos;re only gonna nip inside long enough to use her cauldron .
okay .
do you know where that is ?
i do . the southern moor .
macintosh , macguffin , and dingwall .
the ones who wanted to marry you ?
now you understand why i want to rule on my own .
i &apos;m guessing they &apos;re your brothers .
aye . what do they mean to do to them ?
we &apos;ve waited long enough .
because merida has failed
to relinquish her crown of her own accord ,
we have no choice but to take it from her .
and to punish her for her treachery ,
at day &apos;s end , her dear brothers ...
will be executed .
so they &apos;re gonna die because of me .
that &apos;s not true . we can still rescue them .
no , we don &apos;t have time to plan a proper escape !
i promise we &apos;ll find a way to save them from this fate .
fate .
that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s only one way to save my brothers now .
i need to change their fate , and i need you to do it for me .
was that a kick , my little munchkin ?
oh , thank god . i &apos;m absolutely famished .
the only thing this little one seems to want at the moment
is a plate of onion rings .
i &apos;m under strict orders from the mayor
to only feed you local , organically grown produce .
well , isn &apos;t my sister sweet ?
go !
trust me , if anyone knows what it &apos;s like
to be pregnant behind bars , it &apos;s me .
the dark swan .
to what do i owe this honor ?
just wanted to have a little chat .
afraid i &apos;m not in the mood .
i suppose i could be willing to listen .
so , tell me ...
what kind of trouble do you want to get into ?
eat up .
dark ones don &apos;t judge .
despite these greasy treats ,
i know this isn &apos;t a social call .
what do you want ?
direct-- i like that . take a look at this .
the apprentice &apos;s wand .
you &apos;re the only one around
who has wielded merlin &apos;s magic and lived to tell about it .
it &apos;s nice to be appreciated .
if all goes according to plan , i &apos;ll need your help .
how exciting .
i can &apos;t wait to hear what you &apos;re offering in return .
your freedom ...
and my protection against regina
and anyone else who wants to hurt you .
so the dark one &apos;s here to make a deal ?
how dreadfully unoriginal .
you see , believe it or not ,
that patient with a mop loves to talk ,
and i hear that you &apos;ve been very naughty ,
tearing out that little girl &apos;s heart to break your son &apos;s .
kudos .
that is next @-@ level darkness . well done .
you think you &apos;re allowed to judge
after everything you &apos;ve done ?
no .
but as someone that &apos;s been on the receiving end
of a mother &apos;s betrayal ,
i know that those feelings of hurt don &apos;t go away .
they fester .
so have fun with a lifetime of resentment .
he &apos;ll forgive me . he just needs time .
even with all the time in the world ,
some things can &apos;t be forgiven .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i killed neal .
ready to kiss and make up ?
do we have a deal or not ?
i &apos;ve got my own family problems .
i don &apos;t need yours .
i &apos;m trying to turn over a new leaf .
and with a little one on the way ,
i wouldn &apos;t want to involve myself
with someone that might be a bad influence .
but thanks for the nosh .
if that &apos;s all , i &apos;d like to go back to my cell .
you will need an ally in this town --
maybe not now , but soon .
you &apos;ll be back to take my deal .
i don &apos;t think so , emma .
you see , the difference between you and me is ...
i don &apos;t mind being alone .
all right . coast is clear .
we should go now .
no , no , no . i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t go . i &apos;m sorry .
but y @-@ your shop &apos;s only a hundred yards away .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i can &apos;t .
you made it out of the woods and through the mines with ...
this isn &apos;t just about you getting back
to your shop , is it ?
it &apos;s my leg .
it &apos;s a reminder of what i was
when i fled the ogre wars ...
what i continued to be when i became the dark one
and what i still am is a coward .
but you &apos;ve told me why you have that limp before--
because you walked for days on a broken foot
just so you could return to your son .
do you know how the foot was broken in the first place ?
because you broke it
so that baelfire wouldn &apos;t grow up without a father .
rumple , you may have made many mistakes in your life ,
but this isn &apos;t one of them .
i have always seen the man behind the beast , all right ?
but now-- now i see something else , too --
a hero .
and you-- you just need to learn to see him , too .
where did you learn to do that ?
when i was but a wee devil .
i refused to believe a bow was just something
my mother tied to my curly locks .
my father agreed .
he said learning to fight was essential
whether you wore a dress or a kilt .
he was a wise man , that king fergus .
i wish my father had been as supportive of my adventures .
he wasn &apos;t just supportive .
he taught me everything i know about shooting --
said to me , &quot; lass , if you remember
what you &apos;re fighting for ,
you will never miss your target . &quot;
well , it looks like it was good advice .
aye .
now , is my potion done ?
yeah , a @-@ about that ,
do you know what this potion will do to you ?
think i would ask you to make it if i didn &apos;t ?
but it &apos;ll turn you into a ... a bear .
no , it changes fate is what it does .
the spell of mor &apos;du , they call it .
legend says that witch used it
to change the fate of a prince ,
gave him the strength of 10 men .
so you think that turning yourself into a bear
will make you strong enough to rescue your brothers ?
i know it will .
this isn &apos;t the first time i &apos;ve seen this magic in action .
but , merida , you don &apos;t need magic to change fate .
how would you know ?
i just watched you split arrows
without blinking an eye .
you can make your own fate .
all you need is your wit and your bow .
well , isn &apos;t that a better way to prove to the clans
that you &apos;re worthy of being their queen ?
afraid that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , missy .
okay , come on .
see ? i knew you could make it .
i should &apos;ve known better than to argue with you by now .
here .
now , what did we come here for ?
i told the dark one
you wouldn &apos;t be daft enough to seek shelter in your own shop ,
but she said you wouldn &apos;t be able to resist
the pull of your magic .
merida , you -- you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , i tried to fight it , but i couldn &apos;t .
so now her fate rests in your hands .
what the bloody hell is taking so long ?
patience , pirate .
if these spellbooks are correct ,
as soon as arthur adds the crimson crown to the cauldron ,
he should be able to make contact with merlin .
then we &apos;ll be speaking with him before you know it .
david told us everything .
and you &apos;re willing to help ?
after everything you &apos;ve done for us , it &apos;s the least i can do .
what are you waiting for ?
perhaps it &apos;s best if i do this alone .
back in camelot , merlin delivered his prophecies
to me from inside a tree .
but i &apos;m afraid he only delivered them when i was alone .
this is too important to risk .
come on . let &apos;s leave him to it .
did it work ?
afraid not .
i thought the spell was gonna make contact , and then it ...
just fizzled out .
stop me , you coward .
be the hero we all need .
i ca-- i can &apos;t .
i ca-- i &apos;m sorry , belle .
no , i am ...
for what i &apos;m about to do .
okay .
come on . she &apos;s not gonna stay passed out for long .
what &apos;s that ?
we may not outrun her arrows ,
but there &apos;s somewhere where this can keep us safe .
hand over the potion .
why do you need magic to save your brothers ?
tell me , or this ends up on the rocks .
fine , if you must know .
not long ago , dunbroch was attacked .
it was an enemy from another land .
my father fought side by side with all the clans , and i with him .
as he brought us toward victory ,
i saw a helmed knight heading straight for him ,
his sword raised .
my father didn &apos;t see the knight .
it was up to me .
i had the enemy in my sights .
i notched an arrow , pulled back the bowstring ,
i took a breath , steadied my hand ,
and let the arrow fly .
but i missed .
and the knight ran my father through .
my father is dead because of me .
no , it &apos;s not your fault .
what do you know of it ?
i lost my mother in the ogre wars .
i blamed myself , too ,
until i finally realized the truth .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
i forgave myself .
you have to learn to do the same .
i can &apos;t .
the clans , they lost faith in me that day .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t think i can lead .
now , can i have the potion , or not ?
thank you .
now let &apos;s kick some arse .
what -- where are we going ?
the only place we &apos;ll be safe from emma
and her quivered friend .
wait . you &apos;re taking us out of storybrooke .
this is anti @-@ transformation powder .
this will keep us safe from any ill effects
from crossing the town line .
no , no , we can &apos;t leave ,
not while there are still people we care about in this town .
belle , i used to be the dark one .
i know emma better than she knows herself .
she will keep coming till she gets what she wants .
well , we &apos;ll stop her together .
didn &apos;t you see what happened back there ?
i couldn &apos;t even protect you from merida .
rumple , stop the car .
what ?
now !
‭ belle !
belle !
belle . belle . what are you doing ?
come back in the car .
no .
please .
no .
you know , running never made anyone a hero , okay ?
well , don &apos;t -- don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m not a hero .
well , you &apos;ve been brave before .
when ? during the first ogres war ?
let me tell you the truth about that day .
i didn &apos;t ... cripple myself to get back to my son .
i did it because i was scared .
rumple .
i joined the army to prove i wasn &apos;t a coward .
but when i seen the wounded
coming back from the front lines ...
i didn &apos;t want to die .
i &apos;m a coward , belle .
and that &apos;s never gonna change .
please come back in the car , eh ?
th--this is the only way i know how to protect you .
come on , come on .
protect yourself , you mean .
no .
no .
belle .
belle !
you should have followed your wee sweetheart
over the town line .
o @-@ okay .
he &apos;s not my sweetheart , and i &apos;m not scared of you .
ah , but you should be ,
because now the dark one &apos;s not taking any chances .
she &apos;s making me drink this .
men , today , we cement the rule of our three clans .
with merida &apos;s brothers out of the way and merida in hiding ,
the dunbroch claim to the throne will be erased !
not if i have any say in it .
merida ?
let my brothers go ,
unless you want to end up black as well as blue .
you and what army ?
this one .
just you wait .
in a moment , you &apos;re gonna be very , very sorry .
did you mix it right ?
yes .
but i @-@ i switched the potion with water .
what ?
what game are you playing ? where &apos;s the real potion ?
you defeat the clans with magic ,
the people still won &apos;t follow you .
you need to defeat them as a queen .
if you wanted to teach me a lesson ,
you should have done it before we were surrounded .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t face your fear
unless you didn &apos;t have a choice .
i know you can do this .
enough , merida !
the only way you and your brothers live out this day
is if you relinquish your crown .
after everything my father did
to create peace between the clans , never !
clan dunbroch is the rightful leader of the four clans ,
and i am the sole and rightful queen !
then you leave us no choice .
fire !
noooo !
you saw what i can do with an arrow .
do you really want to see what i can do with a sword ?
now let them go !
you too ?
you &apos;re lucky someone once taught me the value of mercy .
hi , love .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
mother &apos;s gonna be so happy to see you .
merida , listen to me !
don &apos;t do this !
no , no ! she &apos;ll kill you !
rumple , run !
no , belle !
i &apos;m not running this time .
no !
go !
no , no .
do your worst .
how ...
h @-@ how did you know that would transform her back ?
i didn &apos;t .
i knew you had it in you .
you saved me .
actually ...
... i think you saved me .
sure i can &apos;t help you on your friends &apos; quest ?
it &apos;s the least i can do .
no . thank you for your offer ,
but your kingdom needs their queen right now .
what will you do about the man you love -- or loved ?
still don &apos;t know .
all i can do is hope that i get home
and find a way to save him .
but , succeed or fail , i do know one thing --
i won &apos;t give up .
you don &apos;t strike me as the giving @-@ up type .
well , i , uh -- i do hope our paths cross again .
thank you , belle ...
... for everything .
come on .
everything all right ?
you tell me . i have the strangest sense of déjà vu right now .
you know , i &apos;ve always wanted to try one of these .
the last time i had the chance ,
it was in the hands of a little girl with sticky fingers .
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
you .
you remember .
well , i &apos;m flattered .
you were the usher ...
at the movie theater when i was a kid .
how is that possible ?
you were still stuck in the tree back then .
it doesn &apos;t matter how i got my message to you .
what &apos;s important is -- do you remember what i said ?
you said something about excalibur ,
and you told me --
that one day ,
you would have the opportunity to remove excalibur from its stone .
well , i hate to burst your bubble . someone beat me to it .
perhaps , but the sword will return to whence it came .
and now that the darkness is within you ,
it &apos;s more important than ever that you heed the rest of my warning .
leave excalibur alone .
the fate of everyone that you love rests upon it .
he bested me fair and square .
i was getting worried .
for a moment , i thought i was going to
have to drag you down here myself .
no . a hero never runs away from his problems .
now ...
as a former dark one ,
i know you won &apos;t stop wreaking havoc
till i pull that sword from that stone .
good . we understand each other .
and i also know
that you won &apos;t be able to resist making a deal .
so how about i pull excalibur in exchange for merida &apos;s heart ?
and my brothers -- i want to know what happened to them .
you really think you &apos;re in a position to make deals ?
that &apos;s exactly what i think .
i was finished with this anyway .
and her brothers ?
they &apos;re fine , safe and sound by her mother &apos;s side .
now get on with it !
wait .
what happens if he can &apos;t pull it from the stone ?
then you will be sweeping his remains from the floor .
you were his maid once .
belle ...
just in case this doesn &apos;t work ,
i want you to know that i am sorry for everything .
if i had to do it all again ,
i would make sure i was the man you deserved
right from the very start ...
... and i would change everything for you .
it &apos;s never too late .
a deal &apos;s a deal .
now , you may have excalibur ,
but you &apos;ve made one mistake in all of this --
one terrible mistake .
you &apos;ve turned me into a hero .
there are heroes all over this town ,
and none of them have been able to stop me yet .
well , that &apos;s because none of them ... are me .
you &apos;ve checked over that spell a dozen times , regina .
well , i did everything right .
arthur should have been able to communicate with merlin .
unless he didn &apos;t want to .
the crimson crown .
arthur threw it in the fire . he sabotaged the spell .
he lied to us .
i guess he didn &apos;t realize magical toadstools don &apos;t burn .
but why wouldn &apos;t he want us to contact merlin ?
we need to talk to merlin now more than ever .
unfortunately , we need someone he &apos;s chosen .
the apprentice is dead . we &apos;re out of options , love .
perhaps not .
there is one other person in storybrooke
who was chosen by merlin -- the author .
are you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
i &apos;m fine , mom .
it &apos;s just i @-@ i know you &apos;ve been through a lot .
the person who ripped out violet &apos;s heart isn &apos;t my mother .
but emma is still in there somewhere ,
and i &apos;ll do anything it takes to get her back .
you can do this , lad .
merlin ?
if you &apos;re receiving this message ,
then things are worse than i feared .
i don &apos;t believe this .
we &apos;re getting merlin &apos;s voicemail ?
there is only one person who can help you defeat the dark one now .
her name is nimue .
who &apos;s nimue ?
if you want to destroy the darkness , then you must --
no . the dark one &apos;s found me already .
what the hell did emma do to him ?
