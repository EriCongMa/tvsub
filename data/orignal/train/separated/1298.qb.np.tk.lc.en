what a perfect day
for the massachusetts marathon .
now , we &apos;ve got our own race correspondent
ready to tell us all about this 26.2 @-@ mile race .
tom , what &apos;s the mood down there ?
oh , there &apos;s a tremendous amount of excitement right now .
the -- the streets are packed with spectators on both sides .
you can see , the runners are still kind of loosening up ,
getting ready for the race .
i had a chance to talk with the police a short time ago .
they said they expect about 400,000 people
are gonna be lining the race .
they &apos;re gonna be watching
as some 38,000 registered runners go by ,
so it &apos;s gonna be crazy .
it &apos;s gonna be a great day .
there &apos;s hundreds of thousands of people out here watching .
they all have family and friends that are here ,
cheering , supporting them ,
expecting them to cross the finish line .
after you &apos;ve trained , you want to take part in a race like this .
have you seen maura ?
janie , there &apos;s 400,000 people here .
i said inside the dirty robber .
so how &apos;d you get into this marathon ?
i thought you had to qualify .
well , apparently , they don &apos;t check the times of people over 75 .
hello , vanilla --
hey , 5 @-@ 0 , bro .
what up , rondo ?
you two know each other ?
yeah . i arrested him .
bogus .
look ... mm @-@ hmm .
... got me some tips for you .
i heard you need a good c.i.
go away .
damn ! you looking fine today !
you don &apos;t want to go running .
you want to cut out of here with rondo .
i got something in my pocket will make you feel good .
oh , yeah ?
the ladies love this flavor !
get out of here .
go away .
yeah , yeah .
hey , vanilla , you need any help , you come find rondo .
okay , casanova .
all right . go away , rondo .
keep walking .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , really , why are you doing this ?
i thought you hated running .
because i told my friend i would .
your friend ?
oh , hi ! sorry i &apos;m late .
still getting used to these .
you didn &apos;t tell me we were running as mallard ducks .
well , i haven &apos;t built up my foot muscles ,
you know , to the point where i can run barefoot .
we &apos;ll chip in and buy you some shoes .
well , early humans ran very comfortably without shoes .
research has proven that the barefoot strike pattern
is much less stressful .
you , talking google -- stressful .
where &apos;s your matching outfit ?
no , no , no , we &apos;re running for a charity --
professionals for underprivileged kids of excellence .
we &apos;re a team !
team &quot; p.u.k.e. &quot; ?
yes , that -- that is an unfortunate acronym .
at least you &apos;re not a hot dog .
or a mustard .
stay out of this .
look , i said that i would do this
because we said that we wanted to do something together .
but i am not running like lady &quot; puke &quot; gaga .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i ...
i should have realized .
i didn &apos;t ... i &apos;m sorry .
holy crap .
you &apos;re not gonna cry on me ?
no , i &apos;m trying not to .
it &apos;s just that my amygdala and my lacrimal gland
have a connection that i can &apos;t really control .
honey , there is no way in hell i am taking this off , all right ?
i &apos;m already running 26 miles with a camel toe .
ohh !
well , can you at least just take off that baggy tee ?
oh , come on ! i &apos;ll let you walk up heartbreak hill !
oh , i &apos;m walking heartbreak , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
okay . fine .
w-- name it .
the next reddish @-@ brown stain --
you call &quot; blood &quot; before the labs come in .
you want me to lie ?
no . i want you to state the obvious .
hypothetically , based on the crime scene ,
i will determine whether it is possible to hypothesize that
a stain is blood .
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
20 bucks says you cramp out by mile 10 .
you &apos;re on . bet .
and double or nothing , i run like this .
okay .
and i have some footskins for you , too .
don &apos;t push it .
okay . you know , my feet are hurting ,
so i think i &apos;m gonna take mine off anyway .
now , the race has started for elite runners ,
but here we go about to start our first wave of amateur runners .
here &apos;s tom martin .
you excited ?
ecstatic .
you will be .
runner &apos;s high kicks in around mile 12 .
endorphins are comparable to orgasm .
people are already sweating on me .
and they &apos;re off .
ah , there &apos;s a lot of family and friends here .
there &apos;s college students that are here .
they brought their little grills , their picnic lunches --
that type of thing .
there &apos;s just a tremendous amount of support and enthusiasm
for everyone that &apos;s out here taking part in this race .
oh , your son is running . my daughter is running .
she &apos;s a police officer .
hi , guys . how you doing ? we &apos;re the rizzolis .
i &apos;m angela , and this is frank .
what &apos;s up , bro ?
i &apos;m not your brother , &quot; bro . &quot;
all right , lighten up , frank . come on .
jane &apos;s running , frankie &apos;s working .
everybody &apos;s having fun .
i mean , we &apos;re all families out here .
i &apos;d rather hang out with your mother .
okay , that &apos;s not nice .
it &apos;s not a good way to start the day , okay ?
now , these folks are clearly running enthusiasts .
these are not professionals .
and we &apos;re gonna see just how enthusiastic they are
when they struggle to the top of newhart and heartbreak hill .
cramp ?
no , a blister . my right heel is killing me .
too much heel .
your forefoot should absorb the shock .
strike , forefoot , toes .
strike , forefoot , toes .
strike --
that &apos;s enough , jog whisperer .
that &apos;s it ! great stride !
runner down . really , really down .
i @-@ i repeat -- there &apos;s a runner down .
what happened ?
he started zigzagging and then he dropped .
heatstroke maybe ?
no , ma &apos;am , don &apos;t touch him !
she &apos;s a doctor .
this isn &apos;t heatstroke . no pulse .
heart attack ?
blood !
yep , that &apos;s blood .
absolutely not a reddish @-@ brown stain .
maura , this doesn &apos;t count .
c @-@ come here . look , look .
i see it .
this was so not in my training seminar .
it &apos;s an entrance wound . he was shot .
shock . he just bit his tongue .
she said he &apos;s been shot .
no , no , no .
help , help !
there is a runner do--
all right , you don &apos;t talk
or call or e @-@ mail or text anybody , okay ?
it &apos;s my duty to alert the authorities .
i am the authorities .
not mine .
i &apos;m responsible for miles 3 to 5 .
oh . you &apos;re a buffalo scout , yeah ?
so it &apos;s in your honor to be loyal and helpful and obedient ?
hear that ? obedient . okay ?
i want you to go get a stretcher and some oxygen right now .
why oxygen ?
you do anything with that mouth besides breathe
and bad things will happen .
okay ? go .
take his pulse .
he &apos;s dead .
maura , help .
what , you want me to pretend he &apos;s alive ?
no . i &apos;m not gonna be an accessory to lying .
oops ! sorry .
there goes our crime scene .
i understand there are hundreds of doctors and medical workers
in medical tents throughout the race
to take care of any emergencies .
i guess with 38,000 runners ,
you &apos;re going to see hundreds of problems , tom .
yeah , no doubt , sam .
and as the race goes on ,
chances are we &apos;re gonna get more problems and more problems .
put that right there .
okay , maura , help .
no .
we &apos;re gonna get the race officials to stop the race ,
follow protocol , and we &apos;re gonna have a chance in hell
of solving this murder .
listen to me -- we do have a chance .
he is our evidence .
i don &apos;t understand .
what happens when 250,000 people
who are crammed into the city like sardines
find out this guy &apos;s been gunned down
and there &apos;s a shooter on the loose ?
mass panic .
346 pilgrims were trampled to death
during a ritual at ramy al @-@ jamarat
because everybody panicked .
exactly .
so you &apos;ve got a ramy &quot; ala jim jam &quot; right here .
you want that ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t want anybody else getting gunned down , either .
we can stop that .
but i can guarantee you
a lot of innocent people are gonna get trampled to death
if we don &apos;t contain this right now .
now help me !
get it ! get it !
ohh . get it . oop !
homicide . korsak speaking .
hey , korsak , it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re not even out of breath .
i &apos;m not running .
you &apos;ve been talking about that marathon for weeks .
you quit already ?
korsak , we got a shooting victim , okay ?
white male , 30 &apos;s , no i.d.
where are you ?
we got him in an e.m.s. vehicle ,
but we &apos;re not moving .
we &apos;re -- we &apos;re boxed in around mile 3 .
geez , you put it out on the radio ,
press will get wind of it , we &apos;ll have a stampede .
no ! no , no , no , no . no one knows .
sorry .
did you pinch the shooter ?
no .
what &apos;s the matter ?
get to bric .
fire up every security camera in the city .
we got a shooter in the marathon .
i was about a thousand yards behind the victim
when he went down .
i didn &apos;t hear the shot . nobody did .
silencer ?
yeah . it has to be .
terrorist attack ?
no , it -- it doesn &apos;t fit the profile .
he &apos;s not an elite runner ,
and -- and the area &apos;s too residential .
yeah , they &apos;d want more bang for the buck --
big crowd , big casualties .
start or finish line .
sniper doesn &apos;t make sense , either .
i mean , tracking down one amateur runner ?
you &apos;re guessing .
i &apos;m making a conclusion
based on years of experience and training .
can you see the entrance wound ?
uh , yeah , looks -- looks like a close @-@ contact wound .
no , i &apos;ll verify that when i do my autopsy .
shh !
we &apos;ve got people running for at least another four hours .
we can &apos;t stop the race .
there is no way to safely evacuate
half a million panicky people .
what ?
remember the 60,000 college kids
who got rambunctious after a sox game ?
1 dead , 16 injured ?
yeah , and that was with 1,000 riot police .
korsak , we &apos;re not moving .
you &apos;re gonna have to work it from there .
can you get dr. isles on board ?
yeah , she &apos;s not going anywhere .
i &apos;ll run interference with the brass ,
buy you some time .
okay , buddy . thanks .
where &apos;s the nearest medical tent ?
not far .
why ?
we need some muckety @-@ muck race official .
um , who &apos;s in charge ?
ron garvey .
but you can &apos;t talk to him . he &apos;s busy .
he &apos;s gonna be a lot busier if he doesn &apos;t help us .
get him .
get him !
come in .
hey , vince . what &apos;s going on ?
we got the first homicide
in the history of the massachusetts marathon --
a shooting .
oh , no .
we get the shooter ?
no . rizzoli was first on scene with dr. isles .
rizzoli &apos;s kept a lid on it .
good .
she &apos;s a pain in the ass , but she &apos;s a great cop .
it &apos;s a lucky break , having the medical examiner there .
all right .
so we got the charles street bridge closed down .
mass avenue bridge , b.u. bridge -- all closed .
and every side street from here to newton .
the city &apos;s crammed with people with no way to get out .
if we try to stop this race , we &apos;re gonna have mass panic !
hey , vince , i got to try to figure a way
to evacuate all these people !
maybe mobilize other counties , national guard .
you been brass too long , sean .
it &apos;ll take &apos; em hours ,
and even if they get here ,
we &apos;ll have rioting and looting .
right now , we just got one homicide .
okay .
i &apos;ll fill in the commissioner and the governor .
you think you can convince a bunch of politicians
to do the right thing ?
i &apos;m gonna try .
we &apos;re about an hour into the race , tom .
any signs of fatigue ?
at this point , so far , so good .
we &apos;ve had a couple of sprains .
right now we &apos;ve got some dehydration ,
a couple of cases of heatstroke ,
but nothing more serious than that .
although , earlier , we did get a report of a guy down
at mile marker 3 with chest pains ,
we -- we haven &apos;t heard anything since then , and that &apos;s ...
give us some room . nobody comes in this tent .
i need to know that i can trust you with -- with a situation .
my job is situations .
anybody want to tell me about this heart attack v.i.p. ?
yeah .
our heart attack v.i.p. is a gunshot d.o.a.
right . okay .
look , i need to call the governor .
we need to run through our contingency plan .
you have a plan for random shootings ?
okay , so while you guys are figuring that out ,
maura , what do we got ?
help me get his shirt off .
there we go .
all right , well , the bullet must have hit his heart .
explains why the blood rushed
when i compressed his chest .
um , can you run his number , please ?
i need a name .
and i need a coroner &apos;s van .
i got to get this body to a morgue immediately .
maura , you -- you &apos;re gonna have to do this here in the field .
you &apos;re kidding , right ? this ...
this body &apos;s evidence .
i ...
maura , we just sent the ambulance
and didn &apos;t move .
so you &apos;re gonna spend the next six hours
crawling back to the lab while our killer slips away ?
i ... come ...
jane .
okay , sure , jane . yes .
just give me a leatherman and some duct tape ,
and i &apos;m all good to go .
great . i got those both right here .
see ? okay .
so ... autopsy table .
and look .
scrubs .
what else do you need ?
how about an ultrasound ?
done . you -- eagle boy .
can you hack into a computer ?
i took one apart in scouts .
close enough . come on .
i got to get online with korsak and frost .
we got you , jane . we &apos;re plugged in .
okay , who knows ?
i briefed the commander .
all right , is he gonna let me handle here on the ground ?
i &apos;ll run interference for you . what do you got ?
i don &apos;t know .
uh , the vic &apos;s name is damon ward .
he &apos;s 33 years old .
i &apos;m running him .
guys , look ,
we -- we got thousands of witnesses , okay ?
nobody sees a gun , nobody hears a shot ,
there &apos;s no casings at the scene .
what is this ?
shot alert picked up audibles at 9 : 00 , 9 : 32,
and 10 : 00 .
that was the starter pistol , sherlock .
the race starts in heats .
could it have been a random , stray bullet ?
it &apos;s happened before .
dennis rainea got hit by a stray in 1978 .
he ran the last 16 miles of the grand valley marathon
with a bullet lodged in his head .
of course you would know that .
guys , look , if the shot alert didn &apos;t get a stray or anything ,
we could be dealing with a silencer here .
which would mean a pro --
a sniper up in a window or a rooftop .
if we activate swat ,
we got another problem , like panic .
i don &apos;t think this shot came from a roof .
jane , come and see .
take us with you on the computer , if you can , rizzoli .
yeah .
observe the wound track .
the bullet traveled to the ribs ,
collapsed the right lung ,
pierced the heart , kept going ,
embedded itself under the left armpit .
let me see the wound .
confirms our theory , jane .
it &apos;s not a sniper or a terrorist .
that is a point @-@ blank kill shot .
stippling pattern reminds me of the old &apos; 80s crack wars .
so , what does that mean ?
it means he was shot point @-@ blank while he was moving .
the killer was running in the race .
frost , we &apos;re sending photos of the victim .
we need to know who wanted this guy dead .
we &apos;ve got an especially strong men &apos;s field this year ,
led by a couple of runners from ethiopia , three from kenya .
they &apos;re setting a blistering pace .
we may even see a new record set today . tom ?
well , actually , sam , we may .
keep in mind that the elite runners in this race
want to finish in two hours and five minutes or less .
that means that all of the best runners in this race ...
nothing &apos;s leaked to the media .
the governor just got back to me ,
and he just got off the phone with your commissioner ,
and , uh , they &apos;re gonna let you be point on this .
for now .
maybe i &apos;ll vote for him next time .
here &apos;s our victim .
damon ward , 33 .
boston @-@ area native all the way through high school .
lives in new mexico . w @-@ what was he doing here ?
flew in two days ago to run the marathon .
some homecoming .
our vic &apos;s a living lawsuit .
guy don &apos;t have fans nowhere .
ran some shady adjustable mortgage scam ,
took people &apos;s homes .
maybe one of them took him out .
run every name from every lawsuit .
see if anybody he screwed is registered to run this race .
look , this is all very good news , okay ?
we got means , motive , opportunity .
it looks like an old @-@ fashioned murder to me ,
so i have a good feeling that we &apos;ll find our killer .
great .
wow , these are very sophisticated tools .
i don &apos;t miss my lab at all .
is that sarcasm ?
i think so .
well , heads up . this might get messy , people .
am i free to go , detective ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think this is so good for me .
massachusetts general laws chapter 27 , section 4 states --
jane !
yes , quinn , technically you are free to go .
but i don &apos;t know why you would
because you got a hell of a cop eye .
i do ?
better than any nature scout i &apos;ve ever seen .
because she doesn &apos;t know any .
and -- excuse me --
and if you will stay , all right ,
i got a very important job for you .
what is it ?
have a seat .
it requires an explanation .
yes , ma &apos;am .
let &apos;s not get crazy with the &quot; ma &apos;am , &quot; okay ?
i &apos;m not exactly wearing mom jeans here .
of course , what &apos;s so great about this famous race
is just how much fun everyone seems to be having .
tom , i understand you &apos;ve talked to a lot of people
who have a loved one in the race .
now , do they all get to see their runners go by
with this many people there ?
actually , sam , that &apos;s a great question
because a lot of the runners -- i &apos;ve talked to race officials --
and they say about 1 / 3 of the 38,000 runners
have a digital chip in their shoe
so that family and friends can actually track their progress
throughout the course of the race .
i mean , it really is amazing .
but there &apos;s a lot of ways that people are showing their support ,
like this family here
with their lower @-@ tech , hand @-@ painted signs .
hey , frank ! get those sausages going .
those poor boys are starving .
yeah , well , it looks like i &apos;m the poor boy here .
i just got another work page .
another 200 banjos down the drain .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
now , look , all i &apos;m sayin &apos; is --
you &apos;re saying -- you &apos;re saying you &apos;d rather
have your hand up some pipe than cheer your daughter on ?
well , unless my daughter is now kenyan , you know ,
i haven &apos;t seen that much of her .
i haven &apos;t seen much of my wife out here , either .
oh , what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i &apos;m having fun out here with people .
it &apos;s the biggest party day of the year .
it &apos;s also the biggest toilet day of the year ,
next to thanksgiving .
you worked on thanksgiving .
come on , you serve the bird at 5 : 00 .
what &apos;s the harm , anyway ?
your daughter &apos;s not a turkey .
yeah , well , right now , it looks like i am .
you use your fingers ?
well , she has to .
the tool leaves marks . it changes the evidence .
9 millimeter .
anything on it ?
i can &apos;t tell .
it &apos;s not exactly a s.e.m. scope .
and i thought i was negative .
hand me that baggie .
yeah .
okay . i &apos;ll get this to korsak for testing .
i thought you said nobody could get anywhere .
you .
you volunteer at marathons . you run ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
sir . uh ... detective .
my best time in the 800 is --
raise your hand . the other hand !
all right , i hereby deputize you specifically
to run this bullet to detective korsak in the boston homicide unit
without speaking to anyone .
got it ?
please go .
what happened here ?
anybody see what happened to this man ?
sir ?
anybody see what happened to him ?
sir , can you hear me ?
this is officer frank rizzoli .
i &apos;m gonna need an e.m.t. at mile 12 .
i got you , frankie .
i got a runner down .
white male , approximately mid @-@ 30s ,
no pulse , no sign of injury .
put it on channel 4 .
copy that .
we need to talk to jane .
hey , rizzoli .
yeah ?
get over here .
they need you on the computer .
frankie &apos;s calling in from the ground .
please tell me he &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s fine .
but another runner just went down at mile 12 .
oh , god . i got to call the governor .
i repeat i got a runner down .
i &apos;m gonna need a little help here .
this is bad .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need a little help here .
hey , i just got off the phone with the commissioner
who just got off the phone with the governor !
sean ...
don &apos;t say a damn word !
you know what the commissioner tells me ?
tells me we got a second shooting .
i got to hear it from him like
i &apos;m standing around with my thumb up my ass ? !
i &apos;m sorry , sean , but -- - no , you &apos;ll be sorry
when you &apos;re counting pencils in the property room !
what the hell , vince ?
so , what &apos;d you say ?
i said something stupid .
i just gave my word that my team will get this done .
you know how far out on a limb i am on this , vince ? hmm ?
do you have any friggin &apos; idea
what i &apos;m putting on the line for you and rizzoli ?
yeah , i do . we got this .
you better . or we &apos;ll both be counting pencils .
uniform brought in this kid .
he &apos;s got an evidence bag with a bullet ,
and i can &apos;t get him to say anything ,
and he won &apos;t let go of it .
are you quinn ?
is that the bullet from the first victim ?
how many are there ?
please don &apos;t tell detective rizzoli i talked .
give me the bullet , kid . you can talk to me .
she said that if i talked to anyone , bad things would happen .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re safe with me .
i &apos;d rather go home .
sit down till i say you can go .
okay .
the only one you talk to is him or me .
you got it ?
you know what kind of merit badge you &apos;ll get for this , kid ?
open up !
all right , in here .
okay , put him on the table .
right there ?
yep .
okay .
all right , 1 , 2 , 3 .
what in the hell &apos;s going on here ?
we got two runners murdered , we don &apos;t know why ,
and we think the killer is running in the race .
a @-@ and you didn &apos;t feel the need to tell me this ?
i couldn &apos;t , okay ? i had to keep it off the radios .
jane , ma and pop are out there in the middle of it .
i know that . there are a lot of mas and pops out there .
all right . okay , you &apos;re right .
so , what do you have ?
nothing solid .
i &apos;ll do what i can , okay ?
i know .
just got off the phone with the governor .
he wants to engage the national guard
and shut this thing down .
he can &apos;t do that .
you &apos;re gonna create panic and multiple casualties .
look , for all we know ,
there is a serial killer loose , a terrorist .
we need to get people off the streets !
okay , just look .
okay , both these guys have
the exact same close @-@ contact entrance wounds , okay ?
that means same shooter .
out of all of these people ,
our two victims --
wwo white guys about the same age , all right ?
there -- there &apos;s a connection here .
there &apos;s -- there &apos;s not some random shooting .
these guys are being targeted .
all right , that is a theory .
we are shutting this thing down .
look , i need you to man up here , okay ?
or you &apos;re gonna have your big disaster -- mass panic .
and then the shooter &apos;s gonna slip away in the chaos ,
and you &apos;re gonna have innocent people trampled to death .
just give me a little more time ,
let me figure out the connection between them .
i will find the killer .
all i can do is
try to advocate for normal operations to continue for now .
just tell the governor that we got things handled here .
all right . if this thing blows up ...
bomb &apos;s in your hands .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
wow . picking a fight with the governor .
you &apos;re fearless .
no , i &apos;m not .
come on , jane . maybe we should stop the race .
maura , we stop this race ,
we send a message to thousands of people that we give in to fear .
we don &apos;t give in to fear !
okay , i understand that .
i -- if we do ,
then we just end up dying a little bit every day .
which , metabolically speaking , we do anyway .
maura ! really ?
come on !
there &apos;s mike ! yay , mike !
jane , where are you ? are you close ?
uh , no , ma , i &apos;m not . i @-@ i got a bad cramp , okay ?
so you and pop should just go home .
we &apos;ve been here for hours ! your father &apos;s gonna be furious !
yeah , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to disappoint you .
yeah , well , that &apos;s disappointing .
what &apos;d she say ?
she &apos;s not running . she cramped out .
crapped out ? janie ?
no , cramps .
she &apos;s not in the race .
unbelievable .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m packing up .
why ?
why ? janie &apos;s not running . we &apos;re out of here .
i don &apos;t want to go home .
well , i can see why , you know ?
you &apos;re the life of the party .
and , uh , you &apos;re the party pooper .
well , i wasn &apos;t exactly getting an invitation ,
you know what i mean ?
what are you talking about ?
what am i talking about ?
we &apos;ve been out here for five hours .
and the only words you said to me was &quot; fire up the barbecue &quot;
and &quot; open up some beers . &quot;
you know , i feel like i work for you .
if i &apos;m gonna work , i want to go home and get paid for it .
okay , that &apos;s not true .
sure it is .
you know , you always talk about family and being together .
you know , i &apos;m right here , angela . i &apos;m right here .
and you &apos;re spending the whole day
swapping chicken parm recipes all day .
i &apos;m sorry , frank .
i ... i want to be here with you .
come here .
yeah , who could tell ?
oh , my baby .
can you i.d. the bullet ?
think so .
we got a witness on the second shooting .
let me talk to him .
bring him in .
hey , vanilla . i was hoping it &apos;d be you , baby !
damn ! them shorts is slammin &apos; !
man , what you doing up in here ?
rondo , just tell me what you saw .
oh , i saw it all .
dude was running . next thing you know , he fell out .
i knew that player was shot .
but -- that him ?
wh-- which ... ?
did you see who shot him ?
i might have missed that part .
uh , my eyes was fixated on this fine freak
looking all perfect in her running stuff .
but she was no you , but who is , right ?
so you saw a hot girl running in shorts .
you &apos;re a hero .
yes , i am .
and every hero needs his hottie .
get him out of here .
come on . let &apos;s go .
jane , the bullet &apos;s a 9 millimeter hollow point .
it &apos;s a hit man &apos;s bullet .
okay .
which is why it looks like a grenade went off in their chests .
grooves on the slug indicate a silencer .
where &apos;d you learn that ?
you .
i pay attention .
push in more .
see , there are synthetic fibers on the bullet .
looks like various polymeric resins .
what is that ?
pleather .
come here .
the gunshot trajectory along with the fibers found on the bullet
suggests that our suspect ...
was shooting from here .
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it ! the suspect is shooting from a fanny pack .
that explains the pleather .
that explains why nobody saw anything suspicious .
jane .
yeah , yeah .
our two victims went to high school together
right outside boston .
we got something big .
both their names just popped up on an old criminal case .
what kind of case ?
don &apos;t know . it &apos;s sealed .
file &apos;s in the courthouse .
damn it .
a court order will take hours , if we get a judge .
i got an idea .
what , you gonna break in ?
yes , i am .
you in yet ?
you mean since you asked 30 seconds ago ?
ah ! here it is --
state of massachusetts v. ward and walker .
open it .
good idea , korsak .
abracadabra .
oh . your way didn &apos;t work .
tell rizzoli you can &apos;t do it .
jane , our two &quot; victims &quot; raped a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl
back in 1995 -- samantha brown .
they did a rape kit and serology .
where are the results ?
oh , god .
jane , look at this .
monsters beat her .
seems like a solid case .
oh , man .
they videotaped it .
why didn &apos;t this go to trial ?
because there &apos;s a third defendant -- jim filmore .
filmore ? the filmore family -- it &apos;s a very wealthy family .
filmore must have bought off the d.a.
no one ever got access to the rape footage .
you know , part of me
wants to let this shooter finish off this asshole .
check the marathon database . see if he &apos;s running .
filmore &apos;s registered .
so , our third victim is still in this race .
is filmore wearing shoe ?
no . only about half of them do
so their families can track them .
wait -- uh , he had to qualify , right ?
so what if we track him by his time ?
he runs a lot , but he &apos;s pretty erratic --
7 @-@ minute mile in miami ,
10 minutes in new york .
that doesn &apos;t really narrow it down .
he could be anywhere from mile 20 to mile 25.5 .
25.5 ?
well , based on my calculations --
please tell me later .
w @-@ what about samantha brown , the rape victim ?
is she registered in the race ?
not registered .
got a driver &apos;s license , though .
800 chestnut hill .
that &apos;s two blocks away .
you need backup .
no , it &apos;ll take too long . it &apos;s ...
i got an idea for backup . come on .
this race has run so smoothly today .
we &apos;re getting reports that the number of injuries
is actually lower than last year .
is that right , tom ?
and , sam , of course , that &apos;s great news ,
not only for the city but for the race organizers , as well .
i heard that the worst injury so far is the broken wrists .
and i &apos;m guessing somebody stumbled ,
put their hand out to break their fall .
let &apos;s hope , at this point , anyway ,
that all of the runners still out there
eventually cross the finish line .
this is not the race i had in mind .
yeah , me neither .
yes ?
we need to speak to samantha brown , please .
you can &apos;t . she &apos;s dead .
what ?
samantha committed suicide a year ago .
you ask me , she died the day she was raped .
we all did .
i @-@ i &apos;ve seen the case file .
why didn &apos;t it ever go to trial ?
we &apos;ve been waiting for that answer for 15 years .
is your husband here ?
he &apos;s dead of a heart attack .
it &apos;s just me and my daughter , courtney .
can we take a look around ?
we &apos;ve got nothing to hide .
excuse me .
is she here ?
this her room ? why is it locked ?
i don &apos;t know . what are you doing ? !
where &apos;s courtney ?
oh , no . running ... in memory of her sister .
frost , do a marathon database search
for courtney brown .
that &apos;s him .
yeah , that &apos;s filmore .
how the hell we gonna find him in this sea of people ?
oh , god . she &apos;s my daughter &apos;s age .
it &apos;s nothing but a damn tragedy .
i &apos;m looking at a security camera at mile 20 .
mile 21 .
maybe he &apos;s making good time .
dr. isles calculated he could be all the way to mile 25.5 .
there .
right there .
damn , frost , good eye .
frankie , we got him . mile 25 .
we &apos;re two minutes out .
come on , rizzoli .
come on !
all right , frost , where they at ? talk me in .
middle of the street , maroon running outfit .
can you see him ?
not yet .
wait ! yeah , yeah .
can you get to him ?
jane , there ! about 20 yards ahead .
is he running alone ?
yeah , i think so .
not anymore .
that &apos;s the shooter , right ? the girl ?
yeah . hope they can get there .
come on , rizzoli !
hey , jim .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re making good time . i almost didn &apos;t find you .
do i know you ?
no , but , uh , my sister did .
samantha brown ?
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
sure you do . she was a freshman .
you were a senior .
you remember homecoming ?
where you raped her , along with your two other running buddies .
there !
watch out !
come on , rizzoli !
you &apos;re crazy .
that &apos;s what you called my sister when they let you walk away !
she didn &apos;t get to walk away !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
courtney , don &apos;t do it !
wait ! one more !
one more ! just one more !
all right !
please .
please !
easy !
just let my sister rest in peace !
murder never brings any peace ,
to the living or the dead .
go ahead . i got her .
no . no !
what happened ?
she killed damon and ray ?
they didn &apos;t survive their injuries .
burn in hell with your sister , you crazy bitch !
calm down !
janie .
james filmore , you are under arrest
for the rape of samantha brown .
i guess you know who i am ?
yeah , i know who you are .
and i know what you did .
you gang @-@ raped a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
statute of limitations is up . you can &apos;t charge me .
you &apos;re too late .
yeah , you missed one technicality --
you raped samantha when she was 15 .
statute says 15 years from the time
the victim turns 16 .
statute hasn &apos;t run out yet !
huh ?
no .
come here .
yeah .
nobody to pay off this time .
we &apos;ve got the situation secured . thanks , guys .
well , you &apos;re one lucky son of a bitch .
you could have told me rizzoli can run her ass off .
i don &apos;t know .
i was kind of looking forward to counting pencils with you .
this is kind of stressful .
yeah , what a day .
you did good .
you too . still got your balls .
you mean even though i &apos;m brass ?
yeah . even though you joined the dark side .
thanks , sean .
hi . is that the guy you saw ?
could be .
but i know i seen that fine bitch there before .
what did she do ?
well , what do you know ? old rondo saw something .
give me 40 bucks .
what for ?
for finishing the race .
but you didn &apos;t finish the race .
i will .
and i need a loan .
all right .
40 bucks ?
yeah .
all right . there you go .
thank you .
hey !
next time you see something ,
you come talk to me , all right ?
you mean , i am now your confidential informant , vanilla ?
great plan .
i &apos;ll see ya .
where you going ?
heartbreak hill .
oh , now all that &apos;s left is the cleanup .
big job , tom .
the race is finally over .
all of the runners have , in some cases ,
struggled across the finish line .
but now it &apos;s a chance for them , i think ,
to grab a bottle of water , put their feet up ,
catch their breath .
you know , looking around , it doesn &apos;t look that bad ,
considering we had hundreds of thousands of people
in the streets of boston today .
uh , it was a good day .
it was a great race , and i think it &apos;s terrific
that we &apos;re able to hold huge events like this today
in american cities .
how &apos;s the heel ?
it &apos;s good .
i think that runner &apos;s high is kicking in .
yeah .
maybe you should run with garvey next year .
are you kidding ?
i &apos;m not the one he wants to chase .
you want to race , huh ?
yeah , i want to race .
i was born to run !
come on , girls !
come on !
dad !
you did it !
great job .
you did it !
great job . great job .
