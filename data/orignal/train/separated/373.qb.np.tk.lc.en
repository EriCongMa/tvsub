over 68 million americans leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
how did we end up volunteering on this farm ?
we should &apos;ve just gone backpacking .
we signed up for 3 more weeks .
that &apos;s 3 too many .
we &apos;ve only got another month before school starts .
i just don &apos;t wanna waste any more time .
you weren &apos;t like this before he got here .
don &apos;t do that !
don &apos;t make this about jeff .
why not ? you did .
you cannot honestly say that this hellhole
is better than the last one we were on .
shh ! he can hear you .
who , benz ?
he doesn &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .
that &apos;s another problem .
i mean , not a single word of english ?
there are only five volunteers here .
i feel bad for him .
he watched me shower last night .
ugh . you give him a good show ?
i &apos;m serious . it isn &apos;t funny .
if you were so freaked out about it ,
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
you talking about perv the farmer ?
really ? you told him ?
i vote that we get outta here .
bangkok &apos;s only an hour drive away .
we can hitch it , we &apos;ll walk it . won &apos;t be that bad .
i told my mom we were staying here
and i don &apos;t wanna freak her out by leaving early .
i already emailed my parents about it .
they wired me money this morning , $ 1,500,
at a western union in bangkok .
we &apos;ll still be in thailand the whole time ,
but we won &apos;t have to stay here . okay ?
phayu ...
phayu means &quot; storm . &quot;
remember , it &apos;s typhoon season ?
what if one &apos;s coming ?
it is . and places like this get flooded .
it &apos;s a couple days away , but , i &apos;m not gonna stick around .
you shouldn &apos;t , either .
sold .
she hates me .
no .
maybe a little .
don &apos;t worry .
don &apos;t be mad .
i know that it was just gonna be us ,
but it &apos;s still gonna be fun .
that &apos;s not the point .
okay . then ?
how do you know he &apos;s taking us to bangkok ?
he &apos;s lived all over thailand for a year already .
he knows where he &apos;s going .
girls get snatched overseas
because they &apos;re stupid enough to follow some guy .
or stay on some farm with a peeping tom ?
sorry , but i like our chances out here .
jeff ?
wh @-@ where are you ?
where &apos;d you go ?
told you he &apos;s a jerk .
jeff , come on . this isn &apos;t cool .
he &apos;s just being an ass . right ?
this isn &apos;t funny ! jeff !
fbi ! drop your weapon !
last warning ! drop it now !
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
how about &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; ?
guy raised his gun .
we could &apos;ve talked him down .
jack , last time i checked ,
words don &apos;t make you bulletproof .
it was a clean shot . you wanna review it ?
yeah .
let &apos;s forget reviewing it .
how about we go for coffee ?
sure .
oh , let me guess . rain check ?
where you headed ?
thailand .
most exotic place i &apos;ve seen lately is cleveland .
have some pad thai for me .
well , you &apos;re welcome to join us overseas anytime .
we &apos;d love to have you .
thanks , but i prefer the comforts of home .
though , i wouldn &apos;t mind swapping jets with you ,
every once in a while .
not a chance .
double @-@ time it .
come on , boys . come on .
what took you so long ?
says the girl who had a huge head start .
i think that &apos;s a new record for both of us .
it &apos;s jack . i think we got a case .
yeah , thailand .
what , are you telepathic now ?
heart rate , phone calls , and texts .
you should really keep up .
monty &apos;s really rubbing off on you .
hey , just living in 2015 .
oh , look at that .
finally updated your little flip phone .
it &apos;s highly functional .
race you back .
ladies first .
beat ya .
no head start , this time .
yeah .
does that thing have its own zip code ?
listen , you &apos;re not lugging around car seats and strollers .
well , wait till they start playing sports .
you &apos;ll have a whole basketball team
squeezed in there .
with murders and accidental deaths at a record high ,
thailand is quickly becoming one
of the deadliest destinations for tourists .
i remember those british backpackers
who were murdered there last summer .
guess that didn &apos;t stop our victims from visiting .
what do we got , jack ?
american college freshmen laura johnson
and sarah harris went off the grid 2 days ago
and the latest messages
indicated they were in hostile surroundings .
we &apos;ll be taking off in 3 minutes .
good morning , handsome .
hello , lovely .
we got the basics . fill us in , monty .
okay . laura and sarah &apos;s parents are on their way in from ohio .
they confirmed the girls signed up
for a volunteer farming organization
and left the u.s. right after graduation .
volunteering on farms is like
the millennials &apos; version of backpacking across europe .
these programs have been around since the 1970s .
yeah , but they haven &apos;t really caught up with the times .
there &apos;s no background checks for hosts or volunteers .
not exactly the safest choice .
their cell phones stopped transmitting signals 48 hours ago .
what time ?
midnight .
where ?
a mile from the farm , heading north toward bangkok .
i sent coordinates .
that &apos;s the middle of nowhere .
and the girls are adventurous types ,
but not adverse @-@ risk takers .
leaving the farm at midnight
doesn &apos;t sound like something they &apos;d do .
unless they were talked into leaving .
monty , who &apos;s the guy who met them in thailand ?
jeff little .
no cell phone , no credit cards .
according to the girls &apos; photos , they met at the latest farm .
laura sent a selfie of her and jeff ,
but sarah wasn &apos;t in the photo
and she didn &apos;t say anything to her mom about it .
triangle ?
never been a fan of a guy who comes between friends .
anything we should be worried about ?
yeah . he was charged with statutory rape
and kicked out of tulane last year .
he was 19 .
way to bury the lead , monty .
i &apos;m not sure how serious it was .
the romeo and juliet law has downgraded his conviction
from a felony to a misdemeanor .
he &apos;s been livin &apos; all over thailand ever since .
with no traceable funds .
two girls out of their comfort zone ,
a guy with no means of income .
and the lure of money .
laura &apos;s mom wired $ 1,500 .
when it wasn &apos;t picked up in 2 days ,
she called the state department .
even on foot , from where they were ,
it wouldn &apos;t take &apos; em 2 days to walk to bangkok .
something bad happened along the way .
what do the royal thai police say ?
without a body , there is no crime .
the director personally tasked us to investigate
and we &apos;re not gonna wait for a body .
good .
local police should know that we &apos;re all on the same side .
it &apos;s not their job to worry about missing americans .
it &apos;s ours .
i &apos;m so sorry . this is all my fault .
you got to stop saying that .
but it is .
benz never watched me shower .
jeff told me to tell you that .
he knew it was the only thing
that would make you leave .
so do you think jeff and benz
are working on this together ?
probably . i don &apos;t know .
have you eaten yet ?
it &apos;s been 2 days .
i can &apos;t .
we need our strength to get out of here .
i don &apos;t get it .
why is he feeding us , if he &apos;s just gonna kill us ?
maybe he won &apos;t .
then what is he gonna do ?
ah , get off of me .
laura ? what are you doing ?
what is he doing ? !
what are you doing to her ? !
a thai proverb reminds us
&quot; what &apos;s done in the dark soon comes to light . &quot;
clara , glad you &apos;re still takin &apos; my calls .
oh . it &apos;s been a while .
so let me guess : you have not learned thai
in all your spare time and you want me to translate .
if all i needed was a translator ,
i could google it .
you &apos;ve always been way more than that .
hey , clara . how you been ?
good . yeah , how &apos;s christy ?
oh , she &apos;s amazing .
how many kids , now ?
four .
that &apos;s crazy .
and you ? how many new languages ?
zintatu .
three , wow . countries ?
i &apos;ve lost count .
my turn . my turn .
hi , mae .
oh , mae .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen you out of scrubs .
how do you like life in the sunshine ?
well , it beats the freezer .
it turns out , staring at dead bodies kind of took its toll .
so what are the chances you &apos;re in thailand right now ?
well , after a few months in africa ,
i decided to roam southeast asia .
i am studying beliefs about fate .
and ?
everything happens for a reason .
you want the good news or the bad ?
good .
royal thai police
are setting us up with their office .
for bad , there &apos;s a typhoon off the coast .
yeah , they &apos;re evacuating low @-@ lying provinces .
the farm could be underwater in 36 hours ,
so i wanna get there before any evidence is washed away .
let &apos;s head to the station .
all right .
listen , this police force is a boys &apos; club ,
so don &apos;t take it personally .
i know they won &apos;t shake our hands .
well , that &apos;s a cultural norm between men and women here .
i &apos;m talking about professional courtesies .
we &apos;re not the two ladies who will change their minds ?
after 100 years ? hmm .
girl can dream .
hey , listen . a friend dropped me off .
can i get a ride ?
you know any shortcuts ?
a few .
when are you gonna let me drive ?
not today .
so , laura and sarah .
they went off the radar for 2.5 days
with a guy they just met , jeff little .
被捕时在杜兰大学上学 他马上被开除了 并再未入学
it doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s made the best life choices
and it doesn &apos;t bode well
that he &apos;s attached himself to these girls .
he played favorites , leaving sarah odd man out .
you think he split them up for a reason .
i &apos;m thinking he may have been grooming laura as an easy target .
trafficking . of course .
he could be a spotter .
i mean , the girls would trust another american ,
when they &apos;re on their own for the first time .
larger rings are usually centered in the cities , like bangkok ,
and we know they were on their way there .
young , healthy , american ?
they &apos;d get top dollar .
why do humans always find new ways
of hurting one another ?
i was just like these girls .
i didn &apos;t know you volunteered on a farm .
yeah . six in total , all over the u.s. ,
when i was 18 .
it was a different time back then .
yeah , but it &apos;s the same war , even today .
you want your kids to have that independence ,
but it &apos;s so hard to let &apos; em go .
yeah . i think my parents knew i needed to see the world , you know ?
do you miss it ?
what , jet lag ?
takeout ?
dead plants at home ?
no , my driving .
i haven &apos;t done that for a while .
so , apart from your excellent driving ,
do i miss what , exactly ?
saving lives .
yeah . yeah , of course .
yeah , we were pretty good at that .
what &apos;s that smell ?
laura ?
do you think this is how it &apos;ll end ?
wait . please , wait .
laura .
where ... ?
where are you taking us ?
what are you doing ? just let us go .
we won &apos;t tell anyone . please !
they &apos;re not gonna welcome us .
well , as far as they &apos;re concerned ,
laura and sarah aren &apos;t in danger
and , if they are , it &apos;s their own doing .
here we go .
buhni taksin . welcome .
jack garrett . good to meet you .
this is my team , agent simmons , jarvis .
cultural expert clara seger
will be consulting with us .
we &apos;d like the map of the province ,
so we can check the routes they may have taken in and out of the farm .
i don &apos;t speak thai .
she does .
of course . one moment .
the royal thai police force is 250,000 strong ,
but only 70 officers are female
and they were only sworn in 2 years ago .
against the law to smile ?
here you go .
thanks .
we need a search team at the farm .
how many officers are joining us ?
i &apos;m the only one assigned to you .
others are prepping for the storm evacuation protocols .
okay , well , we need to get out to the farm right away .
we need to talk to the owner .
he &apos;s waiting for us .
we are now receiving footage
of the typhoon making landfall in cambodia .
it &apos;s moved north and is due to hit thailand in 24 hours .
oh , it &apos;s you .
mary . frank .
oh , i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
tell me they &apos;re okay .
my team is there now .
we &apos;re trying to put some pieces together .
please .
we should never have let them go to thailand on their own .
laura sent some pictures of a guy named jeff little ,
said he was volunteering at different farms , too .
it seems like they were friends . have you reached out to him ?
i read about jeff online .
he raped a girl in college .
he did what ?
oh , my god .
our girls weren &apos;t in trouble , until they met him .
are those his parents ?
excuse me .
mr. and mrs. little , come with me .
we toured the main property .
already ?
we got here 10 minutes ago .
i should get a motorbike like that .
have you met benz yet ?
yeah . he let us look around .
none of his doors have locks .
laura and sarah stayed in a crowded bunkroom
with two other girls from england ,
who said that they packed up their stuff and left .
guys &apos; room is even worse .
besides this road in here ,
there &apos;s only two other paths that lead out .
so we should be looking for footprints , tire tracks ,
anything that helps us figure out what went wrong and where .
simmons , you two get started .
got it .
i will join you . all right . let &apos;s do it .
now , part of my job is to trace any digital footprint ,
but i can &apos;t find anything on jeff .
when was the last time you talked to him ?
almost 3 months ago .
he was volunteering at farms
through a few different programs .
at least i knew he was getting food
and a safe place to sleep .
have you sent him any money ?
he wouldn &apos;t accept it , if we did .
that whole thing at tulane ?
drove a wedge between us , as a family .
he didn &apos;t feel supported , so he left .
i gave him my credit card , though , for emergencies .
but he &apos;s never used it .
he &apos;s overwhelmed .
his wife , she &apos;s sick .
ask him if there was anything out of the ordinary with the girls .
were they arguing ?
he says the boy spent more time with laura than sarah ,
so sarah seemed lonely
and sarah tried to speak in thai ,
which benz says was thoughtful .
tell him i appreciate the information .
what do you think ?
well , he &apos;s exhausted , but willing to talk .
he seems embarrassed of the conditions he provides here ,
and he &apos;s not surprised that they left .
they &apos;re not the first kids to go .
and i spotted a buddha ,
which means he believes in karma .
what do you think ?
agreed . he was making eye contact with you
and didn &apos;t seem like he was acting suspicious
or hiding anything .
yeah . so , that leaves jeff .
he &apos;s the one thing that still sticks out .
a stranger who forced himself between two girls .
it &apos;s monty .
russell montgomery , as i live and breathe .
is that you , clara ? how you been ?
better , now .
let me put you on speaker .
our challenge here is to find something
before the wind and the rain wash it away .
now , i got no tire tracks ,
but the footprints are the freshest here .
and here .
looks like the girls split up .
hold up . we got blood .
directionality of the spatter says
whoever this belongs to is headed that way .
hey , jack .
monty just tracked the littles &apos; credit card
to an internet cafe in bangkok .
okay , well , we got some blood out here on a path .
you and mae find the source of that blood .
clara and i will head back to the city .
you got it .
you got it .
hi . how are you ?
you see what i see ?
yep .
and that is definitely not jeff .
he says he didn &apos;t hurt him .
we &apos;ve got jeff &apos;s stuff .
we got jeff .
jeff &apos;s dead .
3 @-@ kilometer radius from this point on .
3 @-@ kilometer radius from this point on .
make sure you guys build a perimeter and then push outward .
no .
yes , i have to .
if you find anything , call me .
we &apos;ll come back and reestablish as well .
we &apos;ll come back and reestablish as well .
i have to go down and get -- - no .
you are not allowed .
i can &apos;t get clear photos from -- - hey , hey . come here .
listen , now that there &apos;s a body ,
this is the royal thai police &apos;s investigation .
if we overstep , we &apos;ll be kicked out
before we find laura and sarah .
why not work together ?
because they have a process , a system .
we have to respect it .
you mean to tell me you can &apos;t find anything
in those fancy photos ?
apparent c.o.d. is a severed carotid .
but the elements eroded the flesh ,
so i can &apos;t tell if there was any hesitation .
what is this on the back of his neck ?
got a botched tattoo ?
i could tell ya , if i had access to his body ,
but , since i don &apos;t ...
the only way to know is to examine him myself .
run .
what ?
run .
he &apos;s telling us to run .
tropical storm hunter is moving
up the southern coast of thailand .
it &apos;s due to hit bangkok and the surrounding provinces
tomorrow evening .
many of the farms outside bangkok are lowlands
and are in danger of flooding .
can you excuse us for a moment , please ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
how do you know jeff little wasn &apos;t involved ?
he had a detailed journal ,
telling us he was soul @-@ searching .
there were no indicators he was suffering any psychosis .
he was just a lost 20 @-@ year @-@ old kid .
i will let the others know .
we &apos;re ready for a profile .
gather your officers .
now that jeff is cleared as a suspect ,
we need to focus on what the unsub did to his body .
i want you to take the lead on this .
you think he &apos;ll listen ?
well , if there &apos;s only
you two talking , he won &apos;t have a choice .
simmons and i are gonna go talk to the kid ,
find out what else he saw at the crime scene .
knock &apos; em out .
knock &apos; em out .
our victim &apos;s remains tell us a lot
about out unknown subject , or unsub .
yes , that he liked to use a knife .
it &apos;s more than that .
he abducted three people , but he killed the male first .
and the time of death says that he did it right away .
why would he do that ?
most likely to get rid
of competition and establish dominance .
has he killed the girls ?
it &apos;s doubtful he &apos;s done that , yet .
he &apos;s a power @-@ assertive offender
who gets off on control .
he &apos;ll wanna prolong that experience .
and he &apos;s not gonna get rid of them
until his psychological needs are met .
how does any of this help us find him ?
because everything that he does
gives us a clue to what makes him tick .
he killed jeff little on the trail ,
but he carried his body down to the ravine ,
which contaminated any physical evidence .
he &apos;s more criminally sophisticated than we thought .
he &apos;s violent .
and hunting at night - could be a learned behavior
and it also tells us that he doesn &apos;t have
the social skills to pull off a ruse .
you need to search for anyone
recently released from prison .
ask if anyone fits this behavioral pattern .
thank you .
our morgues are in the hospital ,
but , since this is active ,
they &apos;re going to keep the body close .
i don &apos;t know when our medical examiner can be here .
okay . thank you .
the body has been deteriorating for 2.5 days .
it &apos;s gonna get worse without a freezer .
you might wanna take a look .
just know they &apos;re not gonna answer any of your questions .
i &apos;m not gonna ask any .
okay .
i saw some comfrey root leaves back there .
they &apos;ll help slow the bleeding .
hurry back .
clean cut , no hesitation .
okay , let &apos;s get some of this mud off here .
there it is .
it &apos;s not a tattoo .
it &apos;s not a birthmark .
inflamed tissue , but there &apos;s no blood pool ,
so this was done postmortem .
my name is kosum .
my name is mae .
i think you lost this , mae .
yes . thank you .
is there a problem here ?
go ahead , mae .
hey , did you get the photo ?
uh , yeah .
looks like a symbol of some kind .
it &apos;s not on a flat surface , so i can &apos;t tell , for sure .
will you fill it out and run it
against the popular symbols in this area ?
anything religious , cultural , political .
i &apos;m already on it .
here you guys are .
i thought you left me .
thought about it .
did you get anything from the local kid ?
no . he found the body , but was too afraid to talk to the authorities .
what &apos;d you find , mae ?
zero hesitation on the kill .
used a heavy blade .
he &apos;s definitely comfortable with a weapon .
the skin is raised ,
but there &apos;s no blood pool or irritation .
this was done postmortem .
is that from a branding iron ?
monty &apos;s running it now .
that &apos;s pretty specific .
simmons , what &apos;s in your head ?
uh , i think the unsub watched and waited ,
most likely from higher ground ,
till the three of them were isolated .
he attacked jeff first , the biggest threat .
and he had a compulsive need to brand him ,
like his prey .
what if that &apos;s why he &apos;s kept the girls alive ?
he &apos;s hunting them .
sarah , help ! no . help ! no .
sarah !
come on ! let &apos;s go !
winds and rain are picking up in certain areas .
we do not have much time .
those areas are surrounded by miles of dense jungle .
how do we find them ?
we &apos;ve marked the abduction and dump sites .
until we have a third , it &apos;s impossible to know
which direction will lead to the unsub &apos;s comfort zone .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a narrowed @-@ down area where he feels safe .
most serial killers -- - what ?
we do not have a serial killer .
there &apos;s only one victim .
he took three people at once .
in its nature , that &apos;s serial .
look , apologies if we &apos;ve offended you .
every culture has their version
of multiple violations .
how do you know any of this after only one murder ?
because he left a calling card .
yeah , in this case , he branded jeff .
what brand are you talking about ?
mae was able to lift a partial image from jeff &apos;s body .
my analyst at home is trying to identify it .
hey . i &apos;ve got it .
i &apos;m sending it to you now .
you &apos;re the best , monty .
here you go .
i &apos;ve seen this before .
mani !
it was on mutilated animals earlier this year .
torturing animals is a precursor
to serial killing .
it allows him to perfect his m.o.
and find his ritual .
where &apos;d you find the animals ? -
i can &apos;t make it . you should go .
i &apos;m not about to leave you .
now , get up .
got the three points , the hunting and the kill zones ,
and , now , where the dead animals were found .
what &apos;s chonburi province known for ?
wild @-@ boar hunting .
and land disputes , going back many generations .
we &apos;re looking for a family who &apos;s lost the most .
i know a few .
simmons , get monty on the phone .
he can help us narrow it down .
according to thai records ,
the only survivor is 20 @-@ year @-@ old klahan .
that means &quot; very brave . &quot;
my guess is he had to prove it ,
through a lifetime of violence .
yeah , just spent a year in samut prakarn prison
for attacking trespassers with a spear .
he was released and , days later , his grandmother died .
she was the last remaining relative .
that stressor , combined with his homicidal tendencies ,
created the perfect storm .
are there any cultural traditions
for the last remaining member of a family ?
this could be ullambana .
come again ?
it &apos;s a mahayana festival .
when followers believed the gates of hell open
and ghosts of ancestors visit the living ,
traditionally , offerings are made to the departed .
the unsub , sacrificing humans to his dead family .
and he &apos;s proven they &apos;re worthy by hunting them for 3 days .
he &apos;ll kill them before the storm hits .
there &apos;s something up ahead .
hello !
hello !
oh , god .
what &apos;s that smell ?
we &apos;re back where we started .
huh . these can be used for self @-@ mutilation .
maybe that &apos;s his way of expressing emotion .
and , in this culture , it &apos;s a way
of sacrificing yourself to a higher power .
here &apos;s the branding iron .
oh , check this out , guys .
&quot; tell our parents we &apos;re sorry . &quot;
looks like he &apos;s using the topography as his trap .
look at these terrain features .
there &apos;s a river to one side , mountains on another ,
and a cliff .
means they &apos;re in this area .
yeah , but it could take hours to find them .
let &apos;s move out .
wait . we go out there like
a bunch of alpha males , he &apos;ll attack .
you wanna talk him down ?
or you want taksin to do it ?
i want you to .
he &apos;s not gonna listen to me .
there were many important women in his life .
he &apos;ll listen .
he had a close family
and they were important to him .
just build a rapport
and he &apos;ll respect what you have to say .
this doesn &apos;t have to be his fate .
that &apos;s right .
sarah , look out ! he &apos;s coming !
please , let us go .
simmons , cover her .
okay .
okay . okay .
he was all alone .
so i just set the record for fastest paperwork .
yeah . still took you all day .
let me see that .
royal thai police coin . very nice .
yeah , monty &apos;s gonna love it .
oh , yeah .
by the way , i don &apos;t mean to brag ,
but did you see that back there ?
what ?
taksin had a hint of a smile .
yeah ? doesn &apos;t surprise me .
you are determined , stubborn ,
likely to win someone over .
in this job , that &apos;s a good combo .
does that mean i get to drive the bike ?
no .
did you hear they downgraded the storm ?
yeah ? somebody should tell that to the rain .
these winds aren &apos;t bad .
should make the flight home better .
i &apos;ve been out of the game too long , jack .
i &apos;m sitting here ,
feeling sorry for a man
who killed an innocent kid .
and he would &apos;ve killed more ,
if we hadn &apos;t have stopped him .
you don &apos;t see it , do you ?
that i &apos;m soft ? yeah , i see it clearly .
you &apos;re not .
he was lonely and you connected to him ,
to the humanity in that moment .
feeling alone ?
it &apos;s a horrible thing .
you &apos;re not alone .
you have people who love you .
i miss him .
i miss him so much .
me too .
so what are the chances that i would run into you
just days before my 2 @-@ year bureau sabbatical runs out ?
it sounds like fate to me .
yeah ?
you know , there are no hoops to jump through ,
