a vampire killed my parents .
maybe that was you .
it was all me .
i &apos;m bad , elena , i am bad for you ,
and i &apos;m choosing to let you go .
you think i &apos;m gonna judge you
after i find out that you &apos;ve been tortured for 5 years ?
stop defending me !
do you know the reason we &apos;re together ?
it &apos;s because klaus granted us permission to be together .
i can &apos;t live like that .
you take one more step , we are done .
i &apos;m dying of old age .
good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re katherine pierce .
suck it up .
i may have an idea that will keep you alive longer .
you have the ability to keep living inside someone else &apos;s body .
katherine ?
katherine ?
clear !
give me 200 joules .
charged .
clear !
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
i was just speaking with her .
she sounded fine .
doctors think it was a , um , heart attack .
trust me . katherine pierce is not going to die from a heart attack .
clear !
we both know my mother .
she will fight this .
she &apos;s dying .
every single organ in her body is failing .
vampire blood can &apos;t save her .
i compelled the doctors to let me take her home
so she &apos;s more comfortable ,
but she &apos;s dying .
they don &apos;t think she &apos;ll survive the rest of the day .
what the hell ?
ok . time to wake up , sleepyhead .
no ! i &apos;m not leaving this bed .
which is why we brought breakfast to you .
what &apos;s all this ?
this is your breakup breakfast !
my what ?
damon dumped elena .
why ?
i have no idea .
who spends two years pining after a girl to dump her ?
i can hear you , dumbass .
so that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re just giving up ?
as she should !
i mean , he did say-- and i quote--
&quot; i am a bad person . i am bad for you ,
and i am choosing to let you go . &quot;
you memorized my breakup ?
of course i did .
drink this .
so you sure it was just a fight ?
i just have to face reality .
if damon makes up his mind about something ,
it &apos;s done .
yeah .
it &apos;s stefan .
tell him i don &apos;t feel like talking .
she doesn &apos;t feel like talking .
she doesn &apos;t feel like talking .
well , she &apos;s gonna want to talk about this .
rule number one , think of the worst thing
katherine pierce has ever done to you .
rule number two , toast to the glory of her impending death .
rule number 3 , if you come across something
that &apos;s worse-- which you will--
repeat rules one and two .
she pretended to be buried in a tomb for 145 years
while i waited for her lying ass .
wait . does that beat pretending to be elena
and kissing me on the front porch of your old house ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i don &apos;t think so either . damn .
quarterback , go .
think on that . little gilbert .
she fed to my silas , and i died .
doozy .
then she made me crash my car into a pole
and left me for dead again .
double doozy . drink .
my sister &apos;s dead because of her .
yes , she is
because i wouldn &apos;t have even been in town
to turn vicki into a murderous vampire
if i wasn &apos;t trying to get katherine out of a tomb
she wasn &apos;t in .
group shot .
seriously ?
elena , we were just , uh--
i know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re cut off .
if anyone is drinking to katherine &apos;s last days ,
it &apos;s gonna be me .
she impersonated me repeatedly ...
made aunt jenna stab herself in the stomach
and cut off uncle john &apos;s fingers .
he might have deserved that .
my grams died trying to close a tomb she wasn &apos;t in .
tyler &apos;s werewolf curse got triggered because of her .
klaus followed her to mystic falls ,
and because of that , we lost jenna .
and alaric .
we &apos;re gonna need more booze .
she tried to kill me at least twice .
she did kill me ,
although i &apos;m weirdly better off .
they &apos;re talking about me , aren &apos;t they ?
they &apos;re reminiscing .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m sure i deserve everything that they &apos;re saying .
does my hand look wrinkled to you ?
it looks fine .
if i start to sag anywhere ,
you take a knife and you jam it
into my carotid artery immediately , ok ?
ok .
what ?
you know , even on your death bed ,
you &apos;re vain .
hey . if a girl &apos;s got to go ,
it may as well be glamorous , right ?
that &apos;s definitely an age spot .
this is not an age spot , katherine .
you &apos;re being too nice to me .
why ?
you &apos;re dying .
i think i can muster up a little bit of compassion .
nadia .
rumor has it she burnt down the entire city of atlanta once .
that might win .
all right . knock it off
or take it somewhere else .
you guys are being insensitive .
come on , stefan .
don &apos;t let the sight of a frail , human , elena look @-@ alike
cloud your memories of the manipulative psycho that she is .
in 1864 , katherine moved into my home ,
she compelled me to love her ,
seduced my brother , fed us full of vampire blood ,
and then started a war with the town that got us killed .
exactly . bottoms up .
but centuries before that , she was just an innocent girl
who was shunned by her family ,
so for 500 years , she lied and manipulated
and did whatever she had to do survive , and she did .
she &apos;s a survivor , right ?
so that &apos;s the girl that i will drink to today . cheers .
please . one night of hot sex with her ,
and you &apos;re brainwashed ?
what ? !
what ? !
oh , my--i forgot to tell you .
you were kidnapped and hostaged and--
bottle &apos;s empty actually .
that &apos;s why you never send a busboy to do a man &apos;s job .
nadia , the devil &apos;s spawn .
hey , caroline . did you remember to tell elena that ?
i think my mind just exploded .
ok . katherine &apos;s upstairs .
actually , i &apos;m here to see all of you .
i found a way to save my mother ,
and i need some help .
no way .
even my biased brother knows
i will kick his ass from here to kentucky
if he helps katherine pierce
live one more day on this earth .
no volunteers .
i figured as much ,
which is why i found that old safe
your brother spent his summer drowning in
and buried it on this property
with your friend matt inside of it .
oh . without this .
what ? !
i figured you two would be my volunteers .
congratulations on your intuition .
we &apos;re here . we volunteered .
now tell us where matt is .
matt will be freed once you help me get what i need .
which is what exactly ?
i need a traveler .
katherine was born into a traveler bloodline .
she can make herself be a passenger in someone else &apos;s body
if a traveler teaches her how to do it .
like your boyfriend gregor hopped a ride in matt &apos;s body
until katherine killed him of course .
your mother killed your boyfriend .
why are we saving her again ?
gregor was gonna kill her , and she was protecting herself .
oh , please don &apos;t defend her ,
especially now that you &apos;ve- -
now that i &apos;ve slept with her .
i &apos;m sure you have plenty to say about that .
we &apos;re here .
so we &apos;re just supposed to help you
let katherine take over someone &apos;s life ?
not just anyone &apos;s life .
mine .
i &apos;m going to make her a passenger in my body .
i don &apos;t see any freshly dug ground .
this property it massive .
hello ! is no one gonna comment on the fact
that stefan slept with katherine ?
i mean , that &apos;s kind of a big deal .
does it matter ? we &apos;ve all slept with our fair share of bad choices .
no offense taken .
no . obviously not you .
bonnie bennett !
wait . did you two ?
and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
i didn &apos;t think i was obligated .
of course you were obligated .
you &apos;re my best friend .
oh , my god ! does elena know that her little brother- -
no !
aw ! scandalous sex ! even better !
god , how am i the only person
on the planet who &apos;s not having scandalous sex ?
why don &apos;t we split up and think about that ?
good idea . we &apos;ll cover more ground that way .
no , no ! no , mama . no !
what a mess .
damon ?
ok . i &apos;ll say it . i miss klaus .
i mean , the way this guy used to torture you .
sword in the daddy . nice touch .
get out of my head .
remind me how this slaughter went down again .
oh , right . klaus was gonna kill you in a blood sacrifice ,
and you , being you , ran for the hills ,
only to come back and find your entire family
had been massacred .
so if i &apos;m adding this up right ,
your family &apos;s entire death was all your fault .
no ! no ! no ! no !
put the pillow down , damon .
liz .
if you kill her , it &apos;s murder .
i mean , i &apos;d have to bring you in , lock you up .
there &apos;s all that paperwork .
every awful thing i &apos;ve ever done is linked to her .
she taught me how to kill ,
how to enjoy it .
she ruined me ,
and i can &apos;t take any of that back .
look at how much control she still has over you .
prove her wrong .
matt !
matt , we &apos;re coming for you !
hello , caroline .
klaus .
not exactly the ritz .
travelers don &apos;t have much .
they &apos;re always on the move ,
but on the plus side , sometimes their services can be bought .
i found one who named the right price .
you brought them .
yes , mia .
are you ready to make the deal ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i have the feeling the right price for the deal was us .
i &apos;m sorry , but they asked for doppelgangers .
no idea why .
our rings . they &apos;re messing with them .
we can &apos;t go outside .
sorry . matt &apos;s buried alive . no time to chat .
you &apos;re not even the least bit curious as to why i &apos;m here ?
i literally just whooshed at the sight of your face ,
so no .
damon informed me that katerina petrova
has taken a tragic turn .
so you &apos;re here to gloat over her corpse to be ,
to delight in the closure of 500 years of revenge !
great ! now i &apos;m even less interested .
well , then perhaps you &apos;d be more interested in talking about tyler .
is he- - did you- -
no . i sent him off with little more than a bruised ego .
he really does hate me , poor lad .
revenge , it eats at him .
i hear you two broke up .
because i made him choose- -
me or his stupid revenge fantasy ,
and he chose wrong .
i suggest that you learn from his mistakes
and let katherine die in peace .
dying sucks enough as it is .
no need to rub anyone &apos;s nose in it .
ok . here &apos;s the sedatives from the hospital .
should help with the pain .
i don &apos;t want them .
they make me weak ,
and when i &apos;m weak , he can get in my head .
ok . suit yourself .
they &apos;re right here if you want them .
stillooking for matt ?
any word from elena ?
we &apos;re not on a speaking basis .
didn &apos;t you hear , sheriff ?
he was so afraid to dirty her ...
white dove feathers that he let her little wings fly free ,
and it was all my fault .
that &apos;ll shut her up for a while .
how much further until we reach this lockwood plantation ?
won &apos;t be long now .
we &apos;ve just entered the town of mystic falls .
good .
what is it now ?
looks like a gentleman &apos;s having some problems with his carriage .
at this rate , we won &apos;t arrive until sundown .
what does it matter if- -
who is that ? he &apos;s so handsome .
what do you say , emily ?
think that gentleman &apos;s family
would take in a poor orphan girl from atlanta ?
what the hell was that ?
you never heard the real story
of how i came to meet your brother ?
i want to think that this prophecy
of the universe bringing the doppelgangers together
is absurd ,
but the moment that i saw stefan- -
i can &apos;t describe it- -
the out- of- the- way road , the downed tree ,
the broken- down carriage ,
it just- - it sounds like fate to me .
this isn &apos;t awkward .
guess we probably picked the wrong day to be in a fight , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry , ok ?
it &apos;s not my place to judge ,
especially after everything that you &apos;ve been through .
you don &apos;t happen to speak czech , do you ?
no .
ok . stefan ?
it &apos;s ok .
i guess he wants doppelganger blood .
should we knock his head off ?
depends . if i kill him , do the rest of these boards fall down ?
right . blood it is .
why aren &apos;t we healing ?
matt !
matt !
would you give me the same choice ?
what ?
were i to abandon my revenge against katerina ,
would you offer me the same choice as tyler ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
yes , you do .
you- - you can &apos;t do this to me .
you can &apos;t just show up and distract me
while my friend is in danger .
you know , while you &apos;ve been vamping off in all the wrong directions ,
i heard matt &apos;s distant and desperate screams .
where ?
don &apos;t worry , luv . i &apos;ve got it covered .
trust me . he &apos;ll be quite happy with his rescuer .
i &apos;m gone not 3 months ,
and look at the trouble you &apos;re in .
just go away .
don &apos;t you think that you &apos;ve made your point ?
what point ?
like this one ?
jenna ?
remember when you compelled me to stab myself ?
no , no . no , no , no ! unh !
poor aunt jenna .
i had to compel her to think that she walked into that knife .
she was so confused .
no . no . no more drugs !
hello , fingers .
good- bye , fingers .
enough !
elijah .
katerina .
you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m so sorry . did you think that that was real ?
nope . no one &apos;s coming to say good- bye , katherine ,
because no one cares .
i do .
come on .
let &apos;s get on with this .
guess it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m not claustrophobic anymore .
that &apos;s what katherine helped you with- -
silas aftermath .
she did .
can i just hate her anyway ?
you can .
thank you .
but i don &apos;t .
i know i should , but for some reason ,
i keep rooting for her to find peace .
katherine &apos;s not the only one , you know ?
damon keeps pushing you away
because he hates himself ,
who he is , what he &apos;s done .
just remember that you never gave up on me ,
so don &apos;t give up on him .
don &apos;t let him give up uon you eithre ?
so that &apos;s it ? all you needed from us was a bucket of blood ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
come on .
repeat the spell so i know you understand how the passenger works .
i can &apos;t .
just say it .
jaryakat a zem . daryeet acza .
say it , and it &apos;s done .
your spirit goes inside my body ,
mia will activate you by calling you forth ,
and you get to live .
can i have a moment with my daughter , please ?
i know what you &apos;re going to say- -
we don &apos;t have time for this .
nadia ...
letting my father rip you out of my arms ,
it was the biggest regret of my life .
i should have fought harder to keep you ,
but i didn &apos;t .
so i spent the next 500 years
making sure that i never made that mistake again .
i fought for everything ,
and in the process ,
i had a long , full life ,
and i got to know my beautiful daughter .
and you spent the last centuries
searching for me .
don &apos;t waste another minute on me .
it &apos;s your turn to live .
i can &apos;t do this .
let me .
i &apos;ve made selfish decisions all my life .
let me do the right thing for once .
fine . then go . leave me .
drift off into oblivion ,
but i will not sit by your side
and watch you die .
so the quarterback has been saved .
what now ?
don &apos;t you have a dying girl to go punish for all of her sins ?
i do , but i won &apos;t for you .
so you came all the way to mystic falls
just to back off when i ask you to ?
no . i came all the way to mystic falls to gloat
over a corpse to be , as you so poetically put it ,
but i will leave minus the gloating
in return for one small thing .
and what is that ?
i want your confession .
my confession ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
confession about what ?
me .
as soon as we &apos;re done here ,
i &apos;m gonna walk away ,
and i &apos;m never coming back .
you &apos;ll never again have to look me in the eye
and cover our connection with hostility and revulsion .
you &apos;ll never have to loathe the darkestection parts of yourself
that care for me in spite of all i &apos;ve done .
i will be gone ,
and you will be free .
i just ...
want you to be honest with me .
i &apos;m in college .
i &apos;m building a life for myself .
i have plans and a future and things that i want ,
and none of those things involve you , ok .
none of them .
i see .
no , you don &apos;t , because ...
yes , i cover our connection with hostility
because , yes , i hate myself for the truth ,
so if you promise
to walk away like you said and never come back .
then , yes , i will be honest with you .
i will be honest with you about what i want .
i will walk away ,
and i &apos;ll never come back , i promise .
good .
what the hell happened to you ?
in a shocking twist .
katherine &apos;s daughter &apos;s a psychopath .
she &apos;s all yours .
i &apos;ve had fun messing with her mind all day .
damon .
i know , stefan , i know .
it &apos;s been a rough couple days .
i needed an outlet , ok ?
these drugs are ... hardcore .
close your eyes .
i came to say bye .
i want to see you .
you will .
so this is the memory you came back to ?
a little dark , no ?
damon already had his fun with this one .
this was the worst day of my life .
he said it was my fault ,
that i deserved everything bad
that &apos;s ever happened to me .
he &apos;s right .
he was right , stefan .
i don &apos;t deserve to be loved .
open your mind to me .
look at your father .
he &apos;s gone .
what are you doing ?
you deserve to feel peace .
mother !
you were a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
katherine ...
none of this is your fault .
good @-@ bye , katherine .
is she ...
not yet .
with these drugs ,
she won &apos;t wake up again .
you know , i was in a dark place , damon .
and katherine pulled you out of it .
irony abounds .
you know , whatever is going on with you and elena ,
you need to fix it .
she &apos;s the best thing that ever happened to you .
what , don &apos;t you think i know that ?
i can &apos;t live without her ...
but when you think about it ,
i &apos;m no better than katherine .
elena will be happier without me .
what , i &apos;m being selfless ?
don &apos;t give me that look .
i &apos;m not giving you a look .
katherine fricking pierce has a selfless moment ,
i &apos;m not allowed to ?
fine . fine .
when i get elena back
and the whole universe freaks out
because the fated doppelgangers are torn apart ,
just remember you-- you &apos;re the one
that pep talked me out of doing the right thing
for the universe and all mankind .
i will keep that in mind .
you do that .
hey . where have you been ?
in the woods . i got lost .
so what are we doing ?
we are waiting for katherine to bite it .
so this anchor thing ,
does it mean that you &apos;ll , like ,
be able to feel katherine &apos;s death or whatever ?
i think so . i mean , she &apos;s human ,
but she &apos;s also a doppelganger
and traveler apparently .
so who else do you see over there ?
anybody i know ?
i see lots of people .
my grams , the other witches .
vicki .
i just don &apos;t talk about it , you know , just--
because it &apos;s depressing as hell .
tell matty i love him .
what &apos;s happening ?
she &apos;s here .
she said she loves you .
tell him that i watch over him
and no more knocking around with that blond original chick
who almost got him killed .
wait . wait . what &apos;s happening ? what am i missing ?
me .
tyler ?
rebekah says to tell you
i &apos;m her parting gift .
hey , care .
we &apos;ve really gone through 4 bottles of bourbon today ?
can someone tell these idiots to lay off the booze ?
oh , my god .
alaric ?
ric &apos;s here ?
where the hell have you been ?
i thought you bailed on us
to go find peace or something .
do you honestly think i &apos;d leave damon in charge
and never look back ?
he &apos;s talking about me , isn &apos;t he ?
he says you &apos;re a dick .
cheers , buddy .
cheers .
katherine .
ding @-@ dong . does that mean the witch is dead ?
no .
it &apos;s too soon . i can &apos;t !
wow . you really don &apos;t want to die , do you ?
i swear i just heard your heart stop .
where am i ?
still alive ... sadly .
i thought i was a goner there for a second ,
but i still have unfinished business .
so do i.
i had this whole speech
that i was preparing to give your unconscious body .
let me guess .
hate , loathe , screw you ,
die , bitch , et cetera .
yes .
plus one more thing .
i forgive you .
you what ?
i forgive you .
you weren &apos;t born evil .
your life made you that way .
you lost everyone that you cared about way too young ,
and you didn &apos;t have a family that looked after you .
sound familiar ?
is this the ...
&quot; we &apos;re not so different you and i &quot;
doppelganger speech ?
because i &apos;d be happy to skip it .
i &apos;ll save it for the funeral that we probably won &apos;t have for you .
perfect .
i just wanted to get the forgiveness part out .
it &apos;s part of me that i ...
i never want to lose .
good for you .
now maybe you can help a girl out
and give me one more syringe ,
and if anyone &apos;s gonna plunge a needle in me one last time ,
may as well be you .
symmetry and all that .
elena ...
thank you for your forgiveness .
you &apos;re welcome .
jaryakat a zem . daryeet acza .
hello .
vyjt .
hello ? are you there ?
i &apos;m here .
talk to me . did it work ?
of course it worked .
i &apos;m katherine pierce .
i survive .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
hi . i &apos;m elena gilbert .
