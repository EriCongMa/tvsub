i want to feel pain .
i want to feel every miserable moment of this miserable life .
what is this about ?
what did you do ?
i killed elena .
i think these babies are siphons ,
and i &apos;m afraid they might be feeding off your blood .
as in they &apos;re literally siphoning the vampire magic
out of your body .
i found this in my mail .
it &apos;s a warning from rayna cruz .
once you &apos;ve been marked by her sword ,
she never stops hunting you .
there &apos;s no stopping her . ever .
this is your vicious ,
terrifying , big bad huntress ?
i knew if i sent those postcards ,
one of the heretics would lead me right to you .
what is that ?
my tattoo you keep asking about .
la marca del cazador .
&quot; the hunter &apos;s mark . &quot;
i traced it down to the line .
how come i can &apos;t see the real one ?
because the mark is only visible to the brotherhood of the five .
when do i get mine ?
hopefully never .
if i do my job right ,
you will live in a world without bloodsuckers .
now , get up .
i made stew .
no .
i will not eat .
not until you teach me how to fight .
this should be about the right size for you .
don &apos;t just look at it .
prepare yourself .
battles are won in the mind .
if you do not believe you can beat me ,
you never will .
this is no game , rayna .
you want to survive ,
show me you want to survive .
and never hesitate .
vampires .
it &apos;s coming from saint malo .
let me go with you .
not today , nene .
this is my burden .
one day it may be yours
but it &apos;s not today .
strong .
easy , luv .
you &apos;re just gonna hurt yourself .
right .
we &apos;re going to have to sedate her .
that &apos;s all the bourbon .
vodka , you &apos;re up .
you want a bloody mary ?
or a bloody ... pamela ?
ab negative .
very rare .
you got to go .
no , we &apos;re dancing .
no , we are not .
you . leave . now .
what are you ... ?
i &apos;ll call you .
i need a drink ... and a buddy .
and currently you are my only buddy available to drink .
you &apos;ll notice i &apos;m overlooking the fact
that you nearly killed me the last time we hung out ,
so thanks for that .
are you out of bourbon ?
how &apos;s that possible ?
someone celebrating julian &apos;s very timely demise ?
stefan didn &apos;t tell you ?
put a chair back through his heart .
that &apos;s an oldie but a goodie .
hope he has enough chairs to take out the rest
of julian &apos;s backup dancers .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re too debauched
to even notice he &apos;s missing .
anyway , on the subject of people who have gone missing ,
when was the last time you spoke to enzo ?
because yesterday ,
i got dragged into a very bad l word rerun ,
starring nora and mary louise ,
so we could track down rayna cruz , the big scary huntress--
who , by the way , turned out to be 80 and senile--
when all of a sudden , enzo shows up out of nowhere
and steals her corpse .
what is this ?
and don &apos;t tell me it belonged to carol lockwood .
sorry it took so long to get back , but damon ...
caroline . caroline ...
caroline .
perhaps this isn &apos;t the best time to mention
they ran out of cream .
sorry .
don &apos;t be .
you have every right to be upset .
what did you tell them ?
oh , i compelled the doctors to ignore
all things medicine couldn &apos;t explain .
good .
i compelled a doctor to shut down this entire wing ,
so it &apos;s just us .
didn &apos;t want a vampire c @-@ section to draw too much attention .
has she regained consciousness ?
no , not yet .
i gave her my magic .
i stopped the desiccation .
i knew she was sick , but i left anyway .
it almost killed her .
and what were you going to do ?
allow damon to get his head ripped off in a bloody fight ring ?
your brother needed you .
my brother doesn &apos;t care about anyone or anything .
he made that exceptionally clear yesterday .
have you talked to anyone else about what he did to elena ?
entire drive home , i was trying ...
to figure out a way to tell caroline .
and i just couldn &apos;t find the words .
look , right now , all you need to worry about is inside that room .
caroline &apos;s going to have the babies .
everything will be fine .
and all this will be over .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t quite hear that .
was that cr ... crys ... ?
krystal .
crystal .
krystal .
got it .
with a &quot; k. &quot;
krystal with a &quot; k , &quot; hmm .
sounds like pure class .
with a &quot; k. &quot;
go ahead , let it all out , bonnie .
i &apos;m a vile cheater .
i couldn &apos;t even wait a year .
are you kidding me ?
the last thing anyone wants to deal with
for the next six decades is a cranky , bitter ,
sexless damon salvatore , okay ?
elena would never do that to us ,
which is why she gave you very clear instructions
to live your life .
and apart from your glaring lack of standards ,
this isn &apos;t a bad thing .
yeah , heard you got a thing for the grannies .
huh , hilarious .
i &apos;m looking for bonnie .
she &apos;s not taking my calls .
hold , please .
it &apos;s for you .
tell him i don &apos;t deal with shady old @-@ lady corpse stealers .
i &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s busy .
i &apos;m gonna have to take a message .
i &apos;m looking for rayna cruz &apos;s sword .
let &apos;s just say that it &apos;s beyond urgent .
he wants the sword .
of course he does .
&apos;cause shady people like shady tchotchkes .
it &apos;s not happening .
did you get all that ?
does bonnie know what you did to elena ?
how you incinerated your true love
while she slept so soundly inside her casket ?
yeah , i &apos;ll take that as a no .
reckon that &apos;s wise .
oh , imagine if your precious bonnie found out
that you gave elena a viking funeral .
it &apos;d most certainly shatter that fragile and somewhat creepy
&quot; frenemy &quot; thing you two have going on .
get the sword ,
bring it to me at whitmore ,
or your best friend knows the truth .
so here &apos;s the thing , bon @-@ bon .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna need a ... huge favor .
i &apos;m on my way to the airport now .
i should be there in a few hours .
you don &apos;t have a few hours .
caroline &apos;s stable ,
but the doctor needs to perform the c @-@ section now .
okay , yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i get it .
just do what you have to do .
but promise me you &apos;ve got the best doctors in virginia .
just hurry back .
scalpel ?
here you are , doctor ?
what &apos;s happening ?
doctor , are you all right ?
what the hell was that ?
no , don &apos;t touch that .
i think the babies want to stay
where they can keep feeding off caroline as a source of magic .
i don &apos;t think they want to be born .
i commend you for your valiant ,
but ultimately futile effort .
that was tragic you were unable to save even one of these people .
might &apos;ve given your death some meaning .
but alas ...
stop !
rayna , no ! get out of here .
let my father go .
do you know what happens to obstinate daughters
who disobey their fathers ?
do you know what happens to vampires
who strike down one of the brotherhood of the five ?
you are one of the five ?
if you kill him ,
you &apos;ll be afflicted with the hunter &apos;s curse .
plagued by madness
and driven to take your own life .
well , that does create quite a conundrum .
if i spare your life ,
then you &apos;ll never cease trying to end mine .
oh , i have another solution .
i will not kill your father .
you will .
no , please !
shh , my dear .
be strong .
be brave .
just as your father has undoubtedly taught you .
he &apos;s already dying .
now it &apos;s up to you to put a swift
and merciful end to his misery .
father ...
it &apos;s not your fault , nene .
i can &apos;t stop .
i know .
it &apos;s his doing , not yours .
never forget that .
remember everything i taught you .
use it .
carry on my legacy .
and know that i &apos;ll be with you every step of the way .
great , now we have the world &apos;s ugliest letter opener to give to enzo .
well , now that we &apos;ve got this thing ,
i want to know what enzo has over you .
i &apos;m just doing a solid for a bud , bon .
actually , i &apos;m the one doing the solid .
you &apos;re the one making me do the solid
and now you &apos;re gonna tell me why .
just leave it alone , bonnie .
what did you do ?
couldn &apos;t be worse than whatever was wearing that jean skirt .
fine .
just don &apos;t be surprised
if i leave behind a really detailed journal entry
for elena that &apos;s all about krystal
with a &quot; k. &quot;
be my guest .
damon , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m your best friend .
and when alaric heads to dallas ,
i might be your only friend .
you &apos;re right , bonnie .
you are my best friend , which is why i can &apos;t tell you .
so i &apos;m asking you leave it alone !
thank you .
what do you mean they don &apos;t want to come out ?
valerie said the babies want to stay where the magic is .
and right now , that magic is in your blood ,
which they &apos;re getting a steady stream of .
so what do we do ?
well , valerie &apos;s plan is to channel enough magic
outside of your body so that the babies are drawn to it .
that way they don &apos;t resist
when the doctor tries to pull them out .
funny , i didn &apos;t hear one medical word in all of that .
could someone just call bonnie ?
i feel like she should be here .
i will call her .
and i promise
this will all be fine .
so , where &apos;s dr. valerie now ?
she &apos;s getting help .
what do you mean &quot; help &quot; ?
uh , nora , mary louise and beau .
oh , that is just perfectly reasonable .
putting my life and the lives of these babies
into the hands of the people who tried to kill me .
caroline ?
i am not gonna let anything happen to you .
&apos;cause this isn &apos;t creepy or anything .
got your damn sword .
this is the part where you say thank you .
thank you .
enzo ?
remember thanksgiving of &apos; 53 ?
we were locked in neighboring cells ,
and i told you i was thankful for you
through that little hole in the wall .
i take that back .
like i had a choice .
i &apos;m sorry .
you are ... ?
you don &apos;t recognize me .
surprising since i &apos;ve seen every hunger games .
damon , bonnie ,
meet rayna cruz .
not bad for an 80 @-@ year @-@ old corpse .
no , i saw you .
you were old and sick and dead .
may i have my sword , please ?
ooh , looks and manners !
i am ...
stop or the next one &apos;s in her temple .
i don &apos;t care about you or him or her .
give me my sword , and i &apos;ll be on my way .
you want your sword ?
go fetch !
hear me , great spirit , hear me .
we call upon you in this moment of need .
we bring you an offering .
a woman who desires justice for herself ,
for our tribe .
drink .
she drinks the tea of protection
so that she may be strong
and so that no magic may touch her .
she accepts our singular lives ,
so that she may have many .
i didn &apos;t ask for anyone to die .
no , they are not dead .
they live on within you .
now ...
for the final step .
she wields a weapon of judgment ,
one that thirsts for the blood
of those that prey upon us .
link her spirit
with this sword .
this blade
draws blood from a vampire .
it will connect you .
it will guide you .
it will aide you in their destruction .
wait !
avenge your father .
avenge us all .
* she &apos;s only a bird in a gilded cage *
* a beautiful sight to see ... *
what is keeping the others ?
no doubt still cleaning up what &apos;s left of that barmaid .
someone needs to be more discrete .
* she &apos;s not *
* though she seems to be . *
beau !
beau !
oh , my god .
you &apos;re going to be all right .
he &apos;s not healing .
we must get away from here .
tell lily to book passage to new york harbor immediately .
ship sails tonight .
julian , you &apos;re bleeding .
it &apos;s just a scratch . move now .
let &apos;s go , come on .
come on .
phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous .
venis ad vitur .
venis ad essendier .
factuo partis viventia .
what do you mean , she &apos;s surrounded by heretics ?
you said you were taking care of her .
yeah , and trust me , every possible way
you &apos;re second @-@ guessing me right now , i &apos;ve already done it .
this is our best chance .
listen . i know that this is totally crazy
and not what anyone expected or asked for , okay ?
but what caroline is doing for me ...
i am getting to have the family
that i thought i lost forever .
please .
now , you make sure that nothing happens to them .
please .
i will .
phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous .
scalpel .

about to make the incision .
phesmatos sequitos in lucema ...
vitals are steady .
infantesi mortuous .
venis ad vitur .
venis ad essendier .
factuo partis viventia .
i think it &apos;s working .
oh , my god , beau .
it &apos;s his scar .
you didn &apos;t hesitate for one second ...
... let alone three .
thank you .
of course .
we all good ?
if so , i could use a little help with these ropes .
do you hear someone talking ?
i think i hear something .
sounds like a low drone .
sounds like a traitor .
oh , right , yes , yes , a traitor .
that explains why i &apos;m vervained to a theater seat .
nora ?
did you let rayna get the phoenix sword ?
i didn &apos;t let her .
how do you know ?
beau &apos;s scar opened up ,
which means she &apos;s coming for him .
she &apos;ll never stop coming for him .
once she kills him ,
she &apos;ll go after every other vampire in her path .
i need you to calm down . where are you ?
in the hospital .
with your friend , helping deliver her babies .
wait , what ?
we &apos;re all in danger , bonnie .
beau &apos;s scar is the mark from her sword
and it will lead rayna cruz straight to him .
once you &apos;ve been marked ,
she &apos;ll chase you to the ends of the earth ,
until your soul is back in that stone .
once she gets beau ,
she &apos;ll go after any other vampire in her path ,
and right now this hospital &apos;s full of them .
start her on atropine , 0.5 milligrams .
pushing point five milligrams of atropine .
atropine on board .
beau , don &apos;t despair .
we &apos;ll get you away from here , far away .
beau &apos;s the one who &apos;s marked ; why doesn &apos;t he just go ?
and leave him to be hunted alone ?
we have to protect each other .
we stay together .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t let you leave .
look , you love caroline and you don &apos;t want her to die .
i understand , because that is the way
i feel about nora and she will ,
we all will , if you do not get out of our way !
stay and i &apos;ll do everything i can
to protect you from this woman .
you don &apos;t stand a chance against her ! none of us do !
she &apos;s right .
you have to let them go .
they can take beau and draw rayna away from us .
the doctors are nearly finished .
i &apos;ll do what i can on my own .
you can &apos;t stay here .
come with us .
these babies deserve a chance .
i can give that to them .
they could drain you , val .
you could die .
i have to try .
remember .
never stop running .
not for a moment .

kind of a bad time .
it &apos;s about to get a lot worse .
hottie huntress has the sword and she &apos;s coming right for you .
yeah .
heard you were the one who gave it to her .
impeccable timing , considering caroline literally couldn &apos;t be
any more helpless right now .
i &apos;m working on that .
you know what ? don &apos;t bother , damon .
just sit there and do nothing
before you find a way to make this an even bigger problem .
what is he talking about ?
what &apos;s going on ? what don &apos;t i know ?
damon , why is he so mad at you ?
i screwed up bad , bonnie .
i gotta make it right .
we &apos;ll get to richmond .
from there , we could fly as far from here as possible .
we &apos;ll keep moving .
just like we did before .
hurry .
lily will have secured us passage by now .
i &apos;m not journeying all the way across the ocean in a pine box .
then you can stay here and be buried in one .
whilst these accommodations might not be the grandest ,
they have the benefit of being the least conspicuous .
she &apos;s here .
i do not know what hell awaits you inside this stone ,
but it cannot be worse than the one you have put me through .
get us away from here .
no !
no .

such a gentleman .
where are we ?
well , we &apos;re under the stars ,
enjoying each other &apos;s company .
are you ...
are you in my head right now ?
technically , yes ,
but symbolically , we are on a date .
will you pass me those fries , please ?
oh , this one ... is yours .
extra pickles .
you &apos;re trying to distract me , aren &apos;t you ?
everything okay ?
is something going wrong with ...
no , no . everything &apos;s fine .
i just ...
i figured you &apos;ve had two lives inside of you for months ,
lives that you didn &apos;t ask for ,
lives that will change ric &apos;s entire future .
so the least i can do is keep you company for a little while .
that &apos;s all .
thank you .
she &apos;s here .
phesmatos sequitos in lucema
infantesi mortuous .
how is she ?
they &apos;re about to get the babies out .
what &apos;s wrong ?
beau didn &apos;t get away .
no .
no , that &apos;s not possible .
i &apos;m so sorry , valerie .
and what about the others ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i think rayna &apos;s somewhere inside this hospital .
where &apos;s damon ?
well .
you know ,
you look a lot like my girlfriend
and her three doppelgangers .
not to make things worse ,
but my magic doesn &apos;t work on her ,
and i don &apos;t think damon can take her alone .
stefan , you have to go .
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m not gonna leave her .
i &apos;ll stay and help valerie . damon needs you .
i don &apos;t care what damon needs .
i don &apos;t know what he did to make you hate him ,
but he is so determined to make things right ,
he &apos;s gonna get himself killed .
do you honestly think i would do anything
to put caroline at risk ?
what the hell is going on here ?
stefan , go .
we can take it from here .
how we doing ?
almost there .
you want to send me back to hell ?
let me tell you something , lady .
i &apos;m already there .
stefan .
when i &apos;m with you , i &apos;m happy .
i totally get it if you want to run for the hills .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
&apos;cause i love you .
once a vampire &apos;s been marked ,
she &apos;ll chase you to the ends of the earth .
i &apos;ll see you , brother .
okay , now &apos;s our chance .
the first baby is ready .
and now for baby number two .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s okay .
they &apos;re both okay .
are you going to untie me ?
it &apos;s tempting .
the ropes make it easier to kill you .
you &apos;re gonna kill me ?
look , mate ,
i assure you that giving rayna cruz the phoenix sword
was not on my list of things to do today .
really ?
you know what was on my list of things to do today ?
buy more bourbon .
that was it .
that was the most stressful part of my day .
and then you blackmailed me
and screwed me into this scavenger hunt
and now my brother &apos;s paying the price .
rayna gave me no choice .
no choice ? !
that &apos;s an interesting notion .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
why don &apos;t we let fate decide what happens ?
heads , you live .
tails , you don &apos;t .
elena &apos;s alive .
no , sir , she &apos;s not .
i watched her burn with my own eyes .
no , you weren &apos;t of sound mind .
you were hallucinating .
you saw what you wanted to see .
really ?
tyler thought it best to have an empty decoy coffin .
so now you and tyler are a dynamic duo ?
let &apos;s just say that we have ...
mutual friends
who have the real coffin
and the real elena .
take me to her .
she &apos;s in new york ,
where my friends are keeping her very safe
and very much alive .
good .
what happened ?
are they out ?
are they okay ?
everything &apos;s fine .
babies are healthy .
they &apos;re with alaric .
he took them to the nursery to get them checked out .
they &apos;re okay ?
they &apos;re better than that .
they &apos;re beautiful .
where &apos;s stefan ?
what happened ?
where are you ?
not where i &apos;m supposed to be ,
which is with my girlfriend who just gave birth .
instead i &apos;m running from a hunter
who won &apos;t stop chasing me until she &apos;s put down .
why did you hand over that sword , damon ?
elena &apos;s alive .
what are you talking about ?
long story with a hell of a punch line .
i didn &apos;t kill her , stefan .
she &apos;s alive .
i got a second chance , brother .
and i will fix this .
i will .
i will kill that huntress with my bare hands if i have to ,
and i will bring you back here , i promise .
i promise you .
i &apos;m gonna hold you to that .
how are you ?
exhausted .
hungry .
lonely .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish i could be there .
this is the only way i could stop her .
i know .
i just wish it didn &apos;t always have to be you .
i promise i will come back for you .
i have to keep moving if i want to stay ahead of her .
i love you .
i love you , too .
oh , my god .
you want to hold &apos; em ?
are you sure that &apos;s okay ?
yeah , valerie said it shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
something about the umbilical cord , i don &apos;t know .
i was a little distracted .
this is josie .
in honor of their mother .
and this ...
this is elizabeth .
in honor of your mother .
mommy ?
yeah , i just got on the 20 .
okay . call me when you get there .
what about stefan ?
just go .
okay .
um , okay .
mommy ?
don &apos;t wake up your sister .
where are we going ?
to new orleans .
to visit mommy &apos;s friend .
