第六季 第九集
it @-@ it &apos;s about the whole cosmos .
it @-@ it &apos;s not just in our heads or what happens to us .
i mean , we want to make it about @-@ about crime on the streets
and all that , but it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not about things , it &apos;s about , um ... e @-@ everything .
right ? so , what do you do about that ?
what @-@ what do you do about everything ?
well , you start with the broken window theory .
even one broken window
creates the condition for antisocial behavior .
i remember a time when chicago was different .
when people helped each other . i remember being a little kid
and playing out on the street , going trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
i don &apos;t think anyone would allow their child to do that ...
no , no , cut the last sentence .
go back to the other thing she said .
i remember growing up as a blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
what , with a jump cut ?
no , the &quot; morning in america &quot; stuff .
what are you doing ? cows ?
when were there ever cows in chicago ?
you said &quot; morning in america ... &quot;
yeah ... kids playing ball ,
water hoses ,
uncle sam , blah @-@ blah stuff .
and keep alicia &apos;s voice running .
i mean , remember being a kid
and playing on the street ,
going trick @-@ or @-@ treating ...
then go to the hug .
yeah , sure . let &apos;s try it with , uh , the guitar under it .
okay ...
i remember being a kid and playing on the street ,
going trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
ah ! everybody likes alicia , see ?
uh , have the cosmos idiot nod his head .
there was something where he was nodding his head .
he has a nervous tic . he &apos;s always nodding his head .
what do i care ? what are you , his physician ?
i remember being a kid and playing on the street ,
going trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
yeah ... even the cosmos idiot agrees .
uh , then cut to peter ,
and , uh , keep the guitar going .
... playing on the street , going trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
the key is caring and alicia cares .
i think the job of a state &apos;s attorney is so overwhelming ,
that it needs a person whose heart is in the right place .
and do you have a take on frank prady , mr. governor ?
uh , just tell me what you want me to say
and then i &apos;ll just say it .
uh , alicia as an experienced candidate .
peter , uh , don &apos;t go too hard on prady .
there are legal ramifications .
whenever you &apos;re ready , mr. governor .
i like frank prady ,
but if there was ever a time
for a state &apos;s attorney who has experience and compassion ...
it &apos;s now .
good .
use that as a transition to the shooting ;
the news footage .
mm @-@ hmm , make it black and white , grainy .
go music . go to the irish music .
great , yeah , that &apos;s it , a @-@ a festive courthouse shooting !
what are you-- an idiot ?
the irish wake music , the keening music .
good . now , go to the finn interview .
i don &apos;t really like going into it .
this is for alicia , so anything you can tell us .
i was in court across from will ...
could you use his full name ?
yeah .
i was in court across from will gardner .
we were at sidebar with the judge
when there was a gunshot .
will was dying .
艾丽西娅谈枪击事件
and that &apos;s where you go , and you say
sadness blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
and then we cut back to the diner op .
the murder rates are just insane .
i tried to stop the bleeding , but i couldn &apos;t .
so i just sat there with him ,
waiting for the paramedics to arrive .
i watched the life of this man , this good man ,
fade away because he was trying to help someone .
are you really thinking of using this ?
we &apos;re not just thinking of using it .
we &apos;re using it .
it &apos;s so crass . it &apos;s awful .
i &apos;m sorry , who are you again ? who is she ?
i &apos;m the body woman .
then what are you doing talking ?
alicia , this video is meant to introduce you ;
the public doesn &apos;t know you .
we need to tell them your story .
the shooting is a part of your story .
yeah , but it &apos;s so corny with the boo @-@ hoo @-@ hoo music .
i &apos;m sorry , how many campaigns have you run ?
no , seriously . how many ?
okay , okay . tell the scandal stuff .
tell them how i raised my kids ...
no , this says why you &apos;re running now .
you were personally touched by murder .
do you think prady &apos;s gonna have any trouble
talking about the death of his dad ?
with the photos of the car accident and him crying ?
he &apos;s up by three points , we have no media budget ...
how about the music from titanic ?
you could even cut to shots from titanic .
johnny , i &apos;m losing it . i &apos;m losing it here !
alicia , we want this to go viral online .
so , that can &apos;t happen unless it &apos;s dramatic .
okay , so ...
use the the comparative ad .
where &apos;s the comparative ad ?
we &apos;re still waiting on the full oppo research on prady .
and ... i need you to call peter .
to set up a joint interview for the two of you for tomorrow .
we need a joint interview ?
if you want people to stop asking questions
about your marriage , yeah .
yeah , diane .
sorry , i can &apos;t make it .
she can &apos;t make it .
why not ?
alicia , i &apos;ll have to call you back . he &apos;s here .
good morning .
my name is stu harper . i am the special agent
in charge of the chicago fbi field office .
i was hoping we could just have a moment to talk
before anyone shouts
&quot; attorney / client privilege &quot;
or &quot; grand jury subpoena &quot; at each other .
well , that &apos;s good news , agent harper ,
because i don &apos;t shout .
good-- we &apos;re making progress already .
we need your help , cary .
we are investigating lemond bishop and his drug empire ,
and we need your help building a case .
unfortunately ,
mr. agos was one of mr. bishop &apos;s attorneys ,
so he can &apos;t ...
i understand .
and i know you &apos;re being prosecuted by
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office , cary .
we sympathize .
i want you to know that our investigation
has nothing to do with theirs .
oh , great .
in fact , we want to help you .
agent delaney .
please meet cary agos and diane lockhart .
yes , we &apos;ve had dealings before .
nice to see you again .
i think you &apos;ll agree these are highly unusual circumstances--
an fbi agent playing you one of our wiretaps .
but we have a good reason .
lana ?
i can &apos;t move .
i can &apos;t do business .
they &apos;re crawling up my ass .
it &apos;s not a dead end .
then why am i drowning here ?
you know why-- the lawyer . cary agos .
look , we &apos;re not saying he flipped , lemond .
but the cops smell blood here .
we &apos;re seen as weak .
then what do we do ? he &apos;s a white lawyer .
people take notice . he can &apos;t just disappear .
one to the back of the head .
okay . i want it done .
next week .
make this end .
you &apos;re sure ?
phone me when you got a plan , where and how because i ...
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s an official fbi wiretap
of lemond bishop discussing how to murder you , cary .
when was it recorded ?
five days ago .
thursday the 13th at bishop &apos;s house .
the time frame they &apos;re discussing for your murder
is this week .
uh , we &apos;d like a copy of the tape .
no .
it &apos;s in both our interests to put mr. bishop away .
so , help us prosecute him .
go arrest him .
if mr. bishop is threatening me ,
go arrest him .
why do you need me ?
uh , mr. bishop and his lieutenants were
very careful in what they said .
it &apos;s not enough for an arrest .
but it is enough for you to be very , very worried .
okay . thank you .
uh , cary ,
he &apos;s talking about murdering you this week .
a little hint for next time you do this :
don &apos;t have the woman who &apos;s sleeping with my girlfriend break it to me .
you &apos;re ... i &apos;m sorry , what ?
next time you try to get me to flip , don &apos;t use her .
it &apos;s a fake .
bishop was out of town in florida on the 13th .
even if you &apos;re right , you need to act like you &apos;re wrong .
bishop could threaten something like that .
no , you &apos;re right . what do we do ?
kalinda , hand your ongoing cases to robyn .
the fbi played us a tape this morning
of bishop threatening cary .
threatening him with what ?
assassination .
he &apos;s worried cary will turn on him .
cary thinks that the tape was fake ,
cobbled together from other wiretaps , but
i need to be sure . what do you think ?
bishop may want him dead .
i would agree .
cary says that bishop was out of town on november 13
when the tape was recorded at his house .
could you check that out ?
yeah .
we need to hire cary a bodyguard .
can you do that ?
sure .
court says i can &apos;t be within 30 feet of him ,
so i &apos;ll need your help .
whatever you need .
alicia !
mr. prady .
frank . hello .
i didn &apos;t think we had ...
uh , an appointment , no .
i didn &apos;t want to get into all the mess of that .
uh , do you have a minute ?
i do .
but i &apos;m not sure this is such a good idea .
i know . my campaign manager would kill me if he knew .
but , uh , let &apos;s live dangerously .
before james castro left the race , he gave me this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s dirt .
on you , your husband ,
your children , your family .
i haven &apos;t opened it .
he wanted me to use it against you .
but i won &apos;t .
why not ?
i want to do this differently .
i want to not pound you into submission .
and i don &apos;t want you to pound me .
i &apos;ve heard politicians in the past agree
they won &apos;t go negative , and they always go negative ,
and i think i know why .
because it works ?
no , because it &apos;s a posture .
they don &apos;t mean it when they say it .
otherwise they &apos;d go to the other candidate ,
not the press . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m not going to the press .
i &apos;m coming to you to say i will not go negative .
and i &apos;m asking you to do the same .
now , my campaign manager ,
if he were here , frank ,
would say you &apos;re up three points in the polls .
of course you want to suspend negative campaigning .
yeah , but ...
you must have the same projections i do .
the race will tighten .
you have women voters ,
i have african @-@ americans .
you have catholics , i have limousine liberals .
that &apos;s a flipped @-@ coin of a race .
i like betting . i wouldn &apos;t bet on it .
wouldn &apos;t you rather win without bloodying
each other in the process ?
i don &apos;t have an opinion on that .
i doubt that .
that &apos;s your right .
this is my number .
my private cell number .
my campaign manager doesn &apos;t even have it .
whenever you want to talk , call me .
you shouldn &apos;t give me that .
i know .
but there it is .
you &apos;re not my enemy , alicia .
i know .
i &apos;m your opponent .
call me .
no handlers involved .
no political ops .
just us .
yeah ? cary , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m in your apartment .
okay , he &apos;s in . come on up .
kalinda . you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
look , just five minutes .
i &apos;ve hired you a bodyguard .
i &apos;m fine .
this fbi tap is fake . bishop couldn &apos;t have
november 13 , cary , he was home .
he came back a day early from florida .
i have the flight confirmation .
who is that ?
it &apos;s your bodyguard .
hey , carter , how are you doing ?
good . you want me in ?
yeah .
cary , this is carter grayson .
he &apos;s , uh ...
yeah , i know .
milwaukee bucks . marquette university , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
nice to meet you , cary .
so he &apos;s gonna stay here with you tonight
and then escort you to work in the morning .
you mind if i check your bedroom ?
i already did .
is this the only exit ?
yeah .
kalinda , how much is this costing ?
don &apos;t worry .
the firm is absorbing it for a week .
i worked on it .
thank you .
hey , i want to see you alive .
his pain is your pain .
his troubles are your troubles .
they call him the &quot; gorilla boy &quot;
and he &apos;ll steal your h--
this is peter .
it &apos;s me .
alicia ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
i , um ...
i need you to do a joint interview with me tomorrow .
to stop any questions about our marriage .
sure . um ...
i have an opening at 6 : 00 .
no one knows how it started .
ego ? boredom ?
money ?
and then he was there ,
on the horizon ,
rearing his head .
i do think traditional values
should be part of the debate .
i think the republicans are right on this .
the law is unfair ...
that &apos;ll be darker , grainier .
and then he showed his true face .
d @-@ i @-@ n @-@ o.
democrat in name only .
great . the body woman is entertained .
alicia , he used to be a republican .
he changed parties in 2007 .
it goes to values .
yeah ... but a dinosaur ?
you have to be noisy
to attract eyes on the internet . this is noisy .
the courthouse shooting is noisy ,
but you said &quot; no &quot; to that .
and then he &apos;s home .
transforming back .
the dino hiding his true self .
if he hides this ,
what else is he hiding ?
uh , is this suggesting what i think it was suggesting ?
not in any way that can &apos;t be denied .
you &apos;re saying he &apos;s closeted ?
no .
he put his dinosaur costume in a closet .
that &apos;s all .
he was married .
and divorced .
ten years ago . he &apos;s never gotten remarried .
oh , my god .
you really think we should show this ?
i think it &apos;s fair game .
it &apos;s not about frank prady being closeted ,
it &apos;s about him being inauthentic .
he is a closeted republican .
we have two guys
who will swear he had affairs with them .
so ?
so ... be gay , then .
no one ... no one &apos;s stopping you .
but don &apos;t pretend to be , you know , blah @-@ blah @-@ blah ,
when you &apos;re not .
what do i know ?
i &apos;m the body woman .
oh ... okay .
i &apos;m sorry , guys ,
but we can &apos;t use this .
could we talk ? uh , just the two of us .
sure , fire me . you &apos;d be doing me a favor .
i &apos;ll get you some milk .
i don &apos;t need milk .
prady came to my work yesterday .
he brought me this .
it is oppo research castro had on us .
in a shoebox ?
yes .
but he &apos;s not going to use it .
he asked me to agree not to go negative .
prady said that ?
yes .
good . he &apos;s scared .
no , i think he &apos;s trying to do the right thing .
he &apos;s three points ahead .
he &apos;s trying to freeze things in place .
why are you talking to him anyway ?
he came to me .
i think he wants to run a positive campaign .
alicia , he &apos;s trying to get in your head .
usually , it happens handler to handler .
&quot; let &apos;s back @-@ channel , &quot;
and then you get fed bad information .
did you look in there ?
no .
good . don &apos;t .
&apos;cause whatever they really have , they &apos;ll use it .
they always do . did you speak to the governor yet ?
yes .
okay .
and what about the dinosaur ?
oh , come on .
it &apos;s stupid .
that &apos;s on purpose .
it makes it sticky . people remember it .
i don &apos;t want to be remembered for a closeted dinosaur .
why don &apos;t you leave that with me ?
no , i &apos;ve got it .
alicia , leave it with me .
don &apos;t let him get in your head .
he won &apos;t .
this feels weird .
it &apos;s just for the first day .
so you just stay in my office , or ... ?
that &apos;s the idea .
cary , hello .
mr. bishop , hello .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m ... fine .
hello there . nice to meet you .
ian gatins , gatins &amp; brauer .
i &apos;m mr. bishop &apos;s new lawyer .
are you in the meeting , too ?
uh , no . what meeting is that ?
mr. bishop .
hello .
i , uh , i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here for this .
i guess i should have called first .
everyone &apos;s surprised i &apos;m here .
no , no , no . we &apos;re just ...
oh , cary , hi .
hi . ian gatins .
gatins &amp; brauer .
well , good to see you , mr. bishop .
and you .
shall we , um , talk in the conference room ?
kalinda .
bishop is here for a meeting .
where &apos;s &quot; here &quot; ?
at work .
but he saw me with carter .
you heard me , right ?
it might not be a problem .
it is a problem .
he saw i was worried about him .
he &apos;ll think i flipped .
no .
yes .
where are you ?
i &apos;m working on the wiretap .
uh , let me get back to you , okay ?
was that your friend ?
he confronted me in front of my boss .
said i was sleeping with you .
it put me in a precarious position .
you &apos;re talking about someone that might be murdered .
that &apos;s the real precarious position .
unless the tape is faked .
he thinks it &apos;s faked ?
you want cary to turn on bishop ,
and you just happen to play a tap
of bishop threatening him ?
it &apos;s not faked , kalinda .
and you should tell him to watch out .
okay , then let me have it .
what ?
the tape .
if it &apos;s real , let me go to one of my sound guys
to see if it &apos;s real .
i &apos;ll give you the report
from one our technicians .
no . you want cary to turn on bishop ,
you let me check the tape out for myself .
you &apos;re wondering if i can be trusted .
i &apos;m wondering about a lot of things .
your campaign has oppo research on me ?
some .
let me guess .
they &apos;re going to use the rumors that i &apos;m secretly gay
to make it seem like i can &apos;t be trusted .
yes .
it &apos;ll be effective and probably cost me ...
five points .
i have the same oppo research on you .
my handlers want to wait
until you use the courtroom shooting
to humanize yourself and then we &apos;ll leak
that you were , in fact , sleeping with your boss .
is that a threat ?
no .
i told you i won &apos;t go negative , alicia .
and i won &apos;t .
well , if you don &apos;t , your pac will .
but that &apos;s why i gave you my number .
if my pac does something that angers you , call me .
what will that do ?
maybe nothing .
maybe i &apos;ll take my pac publicly to task
and they won &apos;t do it again .
i &apos;m not a martyr .
i just think i can win a fair fight .
so i want it to be fair .
艾丽西娅 · 福瑞克女士
alicia . hey .
so the governor &apos;s not here yet .
but what we want out of this is comfort and affection .
any physical contact
between the two of you would be good .
hello , alicia . how are you ?
ramona . hi .
i &apos;m on with the entourage .
they &apos;re just pulling up now .
great .
so how do you like working with peter ?
quite a bit .
it &apos;s very challenging .
a lot of late nights .
i guess that &apos;s true .
oh , here . i almost forgot .
it &apos;s the demo you asked about .
uh ... uh , you played the drums .
i know .
a lifetime ago .
we thought we &apos;d be the next sleater @-@ kinney .
oh , here he is .
hello , everyone .
sorry to keep you waiting .
everything good ?
ramona ?
it &apos;s good .
good . let &apos;s do this .
all right , everybody ready ?
i know .
legal advice .
ah . it &apos;s always important to stay legal .
okay , can we get a level from both of you ?
yes , i &apos;m glad to be here
and i want to thank the president
and the first lady for having us .
uh , alicia .
five , four , three , two , one !
that &apos;s a little loud , but okay .
ready .
governor , alicia , how long have you been married ?
ah , i knew that &apos;d be your first question .
20 years .
20 years of married bliss .
and how did you two first meet ?
you want to tell him ?
no . you .
it was a party in georgetown .
they were playing some kind of funny , uh , newlywed game ...
dating game .
right-- and , um ...
i was a contestant .
believe it or not , she didn &apos;t pick me .
well , in my defense , he was doing a mickey mouse voice .
yeah , we all had to put on these ... silly voices .
i saw him afterwards .
it was raining out , and he offered to take me home .
you kept my jacket , if i remember correctly .
no , you gave me your jacket .
peter got all wet in the rain .
and we had to run .
it was coming down so hard .
we ran under a bus stop .
and ... he put his arm around me .
i was a real smooth operator then .
i don &apos;t think i had ever had a happier moment in my life .
so , let &apos;s talk about your children .
yeah , uh , zach &apos;s a freshman in college .
georgetown university .
it &apos;s a little far from home , but great college . uh ...
grace , straight @-@ a student .
sorry , i thought ... i thought you &apos;d gone .
no ... well , just for a minute .
first year law firm .
i have to work really long hours .
uh @-@ oh . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;m just ...
just want ... i wanted to see how you were doing .
i &apos;m good . thanks .
you want to sit down ?
sorry .
somewhere underneath all this is a couch ...
for sitting .
so i &apos;ve been bored out of my mind .
three dui &apos;s , one petty theft and--
ooh ! -- mail fraud .
oh , yeah .
did you want to talk ?
no , i don &apos;t .
yeah , i &apos;m fine sitting .
i ...
you ...
uh , this is stupid . it was good seeing you .
what was stupid ?
i don &apos;t know .
just even being .
lovely .
working late .
yeah .
my cellmates .
alicia .
tell your friend . it &apos;s real .
look-- thank you .
i want you to take this more seriously .
if the tap is real ...
no . you .
i want you to take me more seriously .
lana ...
no .
if this is just nothing to you ,
then don &apos;t come by here tonight , okay ?
there are other people that i wouldn &apos;t mind seeing .
thank you !
芝加哥消防局
hey , thanks . i really appreciate it .
thank you very much .
looked good .
not too much wind .
i &apos;ll see you back at the office .
you did great with the police chief .
he &apos;s in castro &apos;s pocket , by the way .
but between you and prady , it &apos;s gonna be a jump ball .
i thought the interview went well ...
you need to stop sleeping with her .
i &apos;m not saying that because i &apos;m jealous .
i &apos;m not saying that because our agreement is void .
i &apos;m saying that because you &apos;ve been seen .
i don &apos;t understand .
who are we talking about ?
because i have no idea .
you need to stop sleeping with her .
i &apos;m not .
peter , do me the honor
of being honest for once .
i had dinner with her .
if your photographer had stayed around another week ,
he would &apos;ve seen me having dinner with other staff members .
it &apos;s what i do .
were you sleeping with her in highland park ?
i &apos;m not sleeping with her now .
i was pregnant with grace .
were you sleeping with her then ?
alicia , listen to me
i will do nothing to embarrass you .
these weren &apos;t taken by me .
you think i give a crap , enough to follow you ?
they were taken by another campaign .
they &apos;re gonna use this against me .
and you .
and i won &apos;t stand beside you .
not again , peter .
not in a million years .
so ... don &apos;t listen to me ,
keep lying to me , i don &apos;t care .
but do listen to your political instincts .
you want to be re @-@ elected .
you want me to be elected .
then zip up your pants , shut your mouth ,
and stop banging the help .
... some for later .
alicia . good .
we &apos;re ready to go .
tell her .
yes . we need to go with the courthouse shooting .
it &apos;s just too good .
and josh threatened to quit if we didn &apos;t .
use it . i &apos;m ready .
g @-@ good .
um ... you look great .
i ... like your hair that way .
i do , too . let &apos;s do it now .
all right , you heard her ! let &apos;s go , come on !
i was shocked .
i wasn &apos;t used to politics ,
and suddenly i was forced into the middle of it .
with my husband in prison ,
what could i do ?
i went back to work .
i had to work harder than anybody
and then i had to go home and hold my kids .
i got the call at a speech i was giving for peter .
my friend was dead .
will gardner hired me
when no one else would .
and here was more gun violence .
i felt ...
destroyed .
we &apos;re not saying he flipped , lemond ,
but the cops smell blood here .
we &apos;re seen as weak .
then what do we do ?
he &apos;s a white lawyer .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s real or faked ,
but there are no edits .
is it bishop &apos;s voice ?
get me a tape on him , i &apos;ll tell you positively .
when do you need it ?
now .
kalinda ... i love you .
i would anything for you ,
but i can &apos;t bend space and time .
try .
that was interesting , last night .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry , i was ... in a weird mood .
and the mood is gone ?
the mood is ... worrisome .
and why is that ?
because i &apos;m ...
i don &apos;t know .
i wish things were simpler .
things can be simpler .
you just need to ... want them to be .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
people have expectations .
which people ?
i always hated that these offices were glass .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go now .
this is alicia .
hi . we have a problem .
i would expect nothing less .
prady put out his ten @-@ minute video .
my dad ...
he was everything to me .
a musician .
genius . he , uh ...
and then on my 16th birthday ...
nice work , not too sappy , good photos--
someone knows what they &apos;re doing over there .
and here she is again .
i don &apos;t get it-- why are you guys worried ?
it &apos;s coming up .
eat some potato chips .
no , i &apos;m fine .
eat them . they &apos;re good .
i went from my birthday party right to the hospital .
uh , i saw him .
i held his hand ... when he was rolled in .
i know it was hard on frank ,
seeing someone die in front of him .
that &apos;s my dress .
yep . you are wearing
the exact same dress as prady &apos;s mom .
maybe nobody &apos;ll notice .
what , are you , eight ?
everyone will notice !
josh , we have to redo
the interview in a new dress .
well , can &apos;t you guys digitally , you know ,
do whatever it is you do ?
the first thing we tried . look .
ow . hurts my eyes .
we tried dark , too .
damn , i have to redo this interview .
which is too bad ,
&apos;cause it was great . can you get it back ?
sure . i mean , i can try .
i &apos;ll go change .
well , i was shocked .
terribly shocked .
politics was new to me ,
and suddenly there was this scandal .
and then i had to be home with my kids .
&quot; had to be &quot; ? it sounds like a punishment .
right .
i was shocked .
truly , truly shocked .
terribly shocked .
i know . i got this . just wait .
i was shocked .
all i could think about was my kids ,
being home with them .
which i wanted to be ...
because ...
child services said i had to .
i know . just ... wait .
well , i was shocked at the scandal .
politics was new to me ...
and all i could think about was my ...
poor , lovely little kids at home .
okay . shake it off .
right . yeah . i know .
just do it like you did it before .
i &apos;m sorry .
no . i &apos;m sorry .
i hate being the cause of this .
you &apos;re not the cause .
i should resign .
no .
could you please pull over ?
ramona , ramona , wait .
we &apos;re bad people .
i know .
i need to stop being afraid .
do you have an opinion on that ?
people sometimes have a reason to be afraid .
do i ?
i don &apos;t know .
my worry is fear is creating the reason to be afraid .
i don &apos;t have an opinion about that .
i need to talk to bishop .
look , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
phone kalinda first .
you said &quot; phone &quot; -- phone kalinda ?
yeah .
most people in america ,
they say &quot; call . &quot; did you know that ?
makes sense . you call someone .
right , bishop said &quot; call . &quot;
in reception , he said ,
&quot; i guess i should &apos;ve called . &quot;
okay .
on the wiretap , he said &quot; phone . &quot;
&quot; phone me when you have a plan . &quot;
i didn &apos;t hear it .
he said &quot; phone . &quot;
mm , people say both .
no , not usually .
are we betting your life on &quot; usually &quot; ?
i &apos;ve been betting my life on a lot less these days .
i &apos;m not a gambler ,
but it &apos;s amazing how prison makes you one .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to see bishop .
that &apos;s not smart .
bishop saw you . he thinks i turned against him .
i need to convince him that i haven &apos;t .
i need to do this .
this is online ?
with a minimum late @-@ night media buy .
they sent it out to press .
it will get some play .
it &apos;s crude , but effective .
their tag @-@ line is intended to be repeated .
that &apos;s awful .
this is his campaign or his pac ?
his pac ,
but you know they &apos;re coordinating .
we &apos;re not with our pac .
we could .
but we &apos;re not .
we want to use the closeted dinosaur ad .
they went negative first .
i &apos;d do it , he deserves it .
no .
his pac went negative first , he didn &apos;t .
alicia , i &apos;m starting to like you ,
but you &apos;re new to this .
you think you &apos;re bringing something new to campaigning ,
but there is nothing new under the sun .
let us help you win this .
even the nutty lady thinks you should hit back .
thank you for the &quot; nutty lady , &quot; but he &apos;s right .
how &apos;s my introductory ad coming ?
and will was dying .
i got a call about will dying .
it was awful .
just awful .
yeah , it &apos;s not good .
we need to use the dinosaur ad , or we &apos;re gonna lose this .
you know , at some point ,
the candidate is the candidate ,
the manager is the manager .
are we at that point ?
where are we ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s not me , it &apos;s my pac .
at a certain point , that doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;ve been hit .
i know .
let me see what i can do .
no , don &apos;t &quot; see what you can do . &quot;
do it .
give me a day .
a day is a year in politics .
yeah , we saw the ad .
it &apos;s outrageous .
alicia no longer represents lemond bishop .
and her firm only represents colin sweeney &apos;s business interests .
is that a quote ?
it is a quote .
how are you planning to hit back ?
well , we had a plan , but mrs. florrick intends to rise
above the negativity .
what do you mean ?
i mean i had a devastating ad on frank prady
designed by josh mariner .
the king of slice and dice ?
that &apos;s right , the king of slice and dice , himself .
alicia was worried that it was too hot to handle .
slip it to me , john .
can &apos;t do it .
come on , i won &apos;t say where it comes from .
and i &apos;ll give you prominent placement for your next release .
no , this one can never get out .
okay , sit down .
can you just give it to me , please ?
kalinda , sit down there , or you don &apos;t get anything .
okay , you asked me to look ...
howell , i know what i asked you ,
can you just tell me ?
do you want me to start again ?
no , god , please , no .
you gave me the other wiretaps of lemond bishop ,
so i compared the vocal characteristics .
good , is the wiretap fake ?
i compared both the timbre ...
howell .
just tell me .
the wiretap is authentic .
the fbi isn &apos;t faking anything .
bishop wants your lawyer killed .
don &apos;t you want a rundown ... ?
cary ?
where are you ?
i &apos;m at bishop &apos;s .
well , what are you doing there ?
get out .
the tape is real .
bishop wants you dead .
cary ? where are you ?
i &apos;m at bishop &apos;s .
get out . the tape is real .
bishop wants you dead .
where &apos;s carter ?
not here .
he &apos;s in the car .
i had him wait there .
do you know rat @-@ a @-@ tat @-@ cat ?
i will call you back , kalinda .
you get four cards each .
it &apos;s really good , it &apos;s about memory
do you want to cut ?
cary ?
no . no , that &apos;s okay .
good .
you take two cards and you look at them and you remember .
actually , dylan , that was work . i need to go .
you don &apos;t want to play ?
okay , that was pointless .
dad ! you want to play , too ?
more than two people can play .
no , uh , maybe later .
cary and i have to talk .
no , we can do it later . that &apos;s okay .
dad , i just dealt his cards .
i know , and cary wants to play .
but maybe later .
mr. bishop , i just got a call from work .
cary , i need a minute .
and i wish i had time .
dylan ,
cary can play rat @-@ a @-@ tat @-@ cat afterwards .
all right .
bye , cary .
bye , dylan .
why do you have a bodyguard , cary ?
oh , the firm gave me one .
why did they give you one ?
the fbi played us a tape of you threatening to kill me .
and i came here without a bodyguard to tell you
i am not a threat to you .
when did they play this ?
two days ago .
and you believed it ?
i thought it was fake , but i wasn &apos;t sure .
is it faked ?
no .
i talk , cary .
i talk all the time .
i say things i don &apos;t mean .
i &apos;m sure you say things you don &apos;t mean , too .
sometimes .
&quot; i want this situation gone . &quot;
&quot; i want that person to shut up . &quot;
it &apos;s blowing off steam .
afterwards , i talk sensibly .
so , it &apos;s all just talk .
yes .
you won &apos;t turn on me , right ?
no , i won &apos;t . ever .
good .
then i have no issue with you .
the bodyguard had me worried .
well , it wasn &apos;t my idea .
good .
then that &apos;s that .
dylan wanted me to play .
i &apos;ll tell him you had to go .
cary .
don &apos;t hurt me ...
and i won &apos;t hurt you .
you &apos;re good ? meaning you &apos;re not in the house anymore ?
yeah , i &apos;m in the car .
bishop didn &apos;t try anything ?
no , we talked . everything &apos;s good .
so he didn &apos;t say it ?
the tape wasn &apos;t him ?
no , it was him , but he didn &apos;t mean it .
what the hell , cary ?
i have to go .
i take you seriously .
it &apos;s not easy , but ...
i take you seriously .
good .

how did that get online ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re getting calls about it ,
but i didn &apos;t leak it .
don &apos;t look at me , i agreed to bury it .
don &apos;t do that again .
i didn &apos;t do anything , alicia .
you kept telling the press it was hot stuff .
it was .
jon . don &apos;t .
and go with the first interview .
i don &apos;t care that my dress matches his mother &apos;s .
so you &apos;re getting back at me ?
no .
my commercial was from my pac .
yours was from your campaign .
mine was a leaked commercial ,
never meant for broadcast .
leaked by whom ?
i don &apos;t know .
but someone from your campaign ?
that &apos;s my guess .
they &apos;re gonna drag us into the pit , alicia .
i know .
then what do we do ?
resist .
lana . hello .
come on in .
so we have a complication here , lana .
it seems the bishop wiretap was leaked .
we just have a few questions for you .
