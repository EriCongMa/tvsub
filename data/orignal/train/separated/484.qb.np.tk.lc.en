blood relations
help me ...
please ...
help me .
please , oh , jesus .
don &apos;t let me ...
die like this .
not like this .
not like this .
not like ...
you ...
get your barf bags ready , my creatures ,
because these pictures are even more not pretty than usual .
clark howard , till last night ,
in wheeling , west virginia .
murder weapon left on the scene .
is that barbed wire ?
indeed it is , arranged to fit like a noose .
how do you wrap that into a noose ?
i guess it &apos;s the same way that porcupines make love .
very carefully .
yeah , but the tensile strength wouldn &apos;t allow you
to tie it like rope .
it can if you &apos;re strong enough ,
which speaks to the unsub &apos;s physicality .
and the fact that he twisted a head completely around
speaks more to the unsub &apos;s physicality .
it &apos;s a redundancy in the m.o. , isn &apos;t it ?
the unsub possibly tried to hang--
or decapitate .
yeah , or decapitate clark howard .
the noose wasn &apos;t effective , so he kills him by hand .
report says he &apos;s victim number two .
who &apos;s victim number one ?
that would be matthias lee .
mr. lee was killed when he was out hunting .
he was caught in a bear trap . accident , you say ?
i say , no , because the bear trap was launched
from a makeshift projectile hidden inside a tree ,
and it was also lined with barbed wire ,
which is why wheeling p.d. has invited us in .
well , both victims were hunters , but the way they were killed ,
it looks like the unsub was hunting them .
and even though both men were armed
and should have had the upper hand ,
he was skilled enough to use stealth
and the environment to surprise them .
and in order to find this unsub ,
we &apos;re gonna have to do it on his turf ,
where he &apos;s got the advantage ,
and he &apos;s gonna see us coming .
&quot; the past is never dead . it is not even past . &quot;
william faulkner .
two murders in two days .
do the police have any leads
on who would want these men dead ?
they did , until he was killed .
wheeling p.d. was circling
clark howard for the murder of matthias lee .
it &apos;s easy to see why . looking at their case histories ,
both men filed dozens of
harassment and nuisance lawsuits against each other ,
including unfounded claims of burglary and trespassing .
then , in 2011 , matthias lee filed a civil complaint
against clark howard &quot; to kiss his ass . &quot;
clark howard responded with a motion to go ...
you can &apos;t actually do that with the male anatomy .
ok , so maybe this isn &apos;t one unsub , then .
maybe this is just tit @-@ for @-@ tat revenge murders .
sure . clark howard uses the barbed wire
for murder number one ,
and then the unsub gets him back
by hanging him with it for murder number two .
we need to dig deep in the family and friends , then .
that &apos;s our suspect pool .
they &apos;re gonna be reluctant to talk to federal agents .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re very popular in this neck of the woods .
blake , you and jj see who you can get to come to the table .
reid , look into where the unsub or unsubs
are getting this barbed wire .
dave and morgan , find out what you can about the victims ,
what else they might have been involved in
that could have gotten them killed .
i can &apos;t quite tell you why those two boys hated each other ,
just that they did .
according to one of matthias lee &apos;s restraining orders ,
he not only wanted clark howard kept 50 feet away ,
but the entire howard family .
if the animosity extends to the families ,
how many potential suspects are we talking about ?
it could be all of them .
and it could be none of them .
agent hotchner , we see this all the time .
a fella hates another fella ,
then a brother gets involved .
and then a cousin .
you know , they get convinced that the reason
they can &apos;t find work or can &apos;t find a woman
or can &apos;t get off of oxys , &apos; cause of that other family .
so the mom and dad of the two victims
have agreed to talk to us .
who is that ? cissy howard , malachi lee ?
yes . and cissy would only come in on one condition .
she told me if she even smelled malachi lee ,
she would walk ,
and when i asked what that specific smell was ,
she said , &quot; dip and beard lice . &quot;
can we arrange to have them come in separate entrances ?
sure can .
so we &apos;ll have mrs. howard at 12 : 00
and mr. lee at 12 : 30 .
won &apos;t that risk them running into each other ?
exactly .
cause of death is straightforward .
thwack and whack , respectively .
did the m.e. mark this on clark howard &apos;s hand ?
what &apos;s that ?
burn marks .
chemical burns , it looks like .
yeah . &quot; victim had burns on fingers and hands
consistent with lye . &quot;
rossi , they &apos;re on matthias lee &apos;s hands and wrists , too .
it &apos;s almost like they were splashed on ,
as if he was cooking with it or something .
intuition tells me these boys were making meth .
and if they were trying to make each other &apos;s lives miserable ,
they probably weren &apos;t just making it .
they were selling it .
i talked to 3 farmers
who had 3 different strands of barbed wire stolen .
none of them saw the thief ,
but they all swear it was the same person .
the mountain man .
should we have garcia look into it as a pseudonym ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe we should hold off on that .
the mountain man seems to be
a confluence of several local legends .
some say he &apos;s part of the backwoods appalachian population ,
others say he &apos;s a confederate
holdout trying to start a second civil war
to turn brother against brother ,
but the one thing they all could agree upon
is if you go into a darkened bathroom
and you chant &quot; i hate the mountain man &quot; 3 times ,
he &apos;ll pop up and kill you
the next time you hear
lynyrd skynyrd on the radio .
so you &apos;re sure the theft from the farms match the crime scenes ?
yeah . barbed wire &apos;s actually quite specific
depending on what type of livestock you &apos;re trying to keep in
and what type of rustlers you &apos;re trying to keep out .
in this case , the concertina formation
was exactly what was used
to kill clark howard and matthias lee .
except , we have two murders , but you talked to 3 farmers .
yeah . wire number 3 hasn &apos;t been found yet .
that &apos;s not good .
no , it is not .
you gonna catch the snicklefritz that done this to my baby ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
you better .
tell me , why did clark and matthias hate each other ?
don &apos;t rightly know .
some bad blood .
&quot; i wouldn &apos;t put him out if he was on fire .
but i might light a cigarette off him . &quot;
these are your son &apos;s words when he was questioned .
and my words to him were , clark , if you so much
as hurt a hair on matthias lee &apos;s head ,
i will smite you like jeroboam .
you don &apos;t even know who that is , do you ?
second kings , old testament .
he followed in succession after king david .
god killed his son , his wife , and ultimately him .
so , you got some book learnin &apos; . well , good for you .
don &apos;t mean you got the sense to catch my boy &apos;s killer .
&apos;cause i can tell you think i &apos;m lyin &apos; to you .
well , let me tell you something , mr. fbi man .
my son is innocent of harming that lee boy .
&apos;cause his words to them cops ,
those were the words of stupidity and bravado .
but my words to him ...
in my family , under my roof ,
my word is law .
now , we done ?
mr. lee , please .
all right , will you answer one question ?
who do you think is behind matthias &apos; murder ?
mrs. jareau--
agent jareau .
it &apos;s mrs. jareau .
unless that ring on your finger is some kind of lesbian thing .
i know how you all like to do it up there in d.c.
you see , this here is a family matter .
and we would appreciate it
if the federal government just back off .
ok .
you &apos;re free to go .
i &apos;ll escort you out of the station .
oh , hold the elevator .
where are you parked , mr. lee ?
malachi ?
p2 .
you visit your daddy &apos;s grave recently ?
you visit yours ?
per my sweet jj &apos;s request ,
i have combed through the lives of the lee and howard fathers .
now , going backwards ,
there &apos;s nothing particularly compelling about either of their graves ,
but , holy cow , everything before it is .
so , gather around the campfire , my friends ,
&apos;cause this one is quite the story .
ok , so the family forefathers ,
carl howard and munroe lee , specifically ,
grew up in the wheeling area circa prohibition time .
and they were competing moonshine runners .
which started a family feud .
did it ever . an exceptionally bloody one .
cousins , spouses , children .
no one was spared .
how long did the violence last ?
until the passage of the 21st amendment .
once firewater became legal ,
they lost their bloodthirstiness @-@ ness .
until clark and matthias brought it back .
the new underground market
brought back old rivalries to the surface .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before the howards attack the lees again .
i mean , they were basically announcing it to us in the elevator .
we &apos;ve got to find a way to defuse the situation
or these families will tear each other apart .
that &apos;s excellent .
that is excellent .
and on behalf of my father , i want to thank you
for doing business with us .
well , i know you have your choices for product
in the wheeling area ,
so the fact that you &apos;re favoring us--
maddie !
oh , please !
oh , please ! oh , god !
no !
why aren &apos;t you people stopping this ?
we &apos;re trying to , but--
but what ? ! they killed my wife !
ok . it &apos;s all right .
you know , it &apos;s obviously the howards that are doing this .
why ? what &apos;s going on between the two families ?
that &apos;s none of your damn business .
it is now .
is it crystal meth ?
ohh . i see . of course .
so we &apos;re just a bunch of dumb west virginia hicks .
we must be cooking meth .
i tell you what . you search my house
and you search my bank account
and you come back and tell me that i &apos;m dealing drugs .
i thought you were smarter than that .
jj ...
bad ?
yeah . head taken clean off .
and we found the third piece of barbed wire
that reid reported stolen .
it doesn &apos;t mean this is over .
we profiled a series of retaliatory attacks .
right now it &apos;s howards two , lees , one .
hotch .
mrs. howard .
heard through the grapevine
you &apos;re looking for an old monte carlo .
you know someone who drives a car like that ?
i know someone who don &apos;t .
here &apos;s a copy of every vehicle
registered in the howard family name .
that &apos;s all well and good , mrs. howard ,
but when someone &apos;s this eager to prove their innocence ,
it makes us wonder .
well , it &apos;s true enough .
there &apos;s no love lost between the howards and the lees .
but we would never hurt a woman
who did nothing but raising her babies .
we didn &apos;t do this , agent hotchner .
you &apos;ll see .
my men are all here . we &apos;re ready for your profile .
we need a little more time .
oh , mama .
mama ... help ...
ok , if we hit the reset button on the profile ,
what do we have ?
well , the behavior points to one obvious theory .
revenge murders stoking the fire of a family feud .
with the forensic evidence to back it up .
physical evidence of methamphetamine production .
the only problem is every time we dig a little deeper
into the families , that theory falls apart .
the howards are certainly doing everything they can
to prove this isn &apos;t about revenge for them .
but the unsub want the families to think that it is .
what if it &apos;s an outsider
like you would see in the drug cartel model ?
one supplier eliminates two major competitors
by getting them to fight with each other .
except what are they fighting over ?
miles lee made a good point when i questioned him .
there is nothing in his home
or bank account to indicate he was a dealer .
ready , ready .
so garcia and i dug a little deeper . take it away .
i did some peeking into both
the lee and howard online shopping activity .
here &apos;s what i found .
in addition to lye ,
they bought--are you ready ?
sodium hydroxide , methanol ,
mixing beakers , digital scales ,
safety glasses , gloves , aprons--
all of which you need for meth .
but the arrest record in the community told a different story .
neither the howards nor the lees are even tangentially involved .
garcia , where were the purchases shipped ?
uh , the howards spread them out .
the other side just sent them to one address , malachi lee &apos;s farm .
we don &apos;t have a profile
until we know what the family business is .
let &apos;s go get some answers .
thanks , garcia .
don &apos;t shoot !
show me your hands !
don &apos;t shoot !
show me your hands !
on your knees ! now !
don &apos;t shoot . you gonna blow us all sky high .
we comin &apos; out .
put down the weapons .
put &apos; em down !
i &apos;m the one who opened fire , not my kids .
you didn &apos;t say who you were .
we thought you was the howards .
we &apos;re fbi . how &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s still private property . you &apos;re trespassin &apos; .
you need a warrant . you can &apos;t go in there .
couldn &apos;t agree with you more .
there &apos;s no ventilation .
if they were cooking meth in here ,
they &apos;d all be dead from the fumes .
so what exactly are they cooking ?
it smells like cooking oil .
more like used cooking oil .
waste runoff collected by restaurants
and just thrown out like garbage .
i think i might know what they &apos;re up to .
i started reading about biofuel ,
where you take a clean @-@ burning
waste product like used cooking oil
and you turn it into an ethanol gas .
i know the conversion method &apos;s similar to meth .
yeah , but , only this stuff is legal .
and believe it or not , it &apos;s way more profitable .
dave , wait !
why didn &apos;t you tell us this is what you were selling ?
&apos;cause if the outsiders knew how much money we were making ,
we &apos;d become targets .
you already are .
guys , i &apos;m a little worried i wasted my time
being an expert in my field ,
because this biofuel thing has a massive payout .
how much money are we talking about ?
we &apos;re talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars .
so , it turns out the lee and howard families
took all of their old moonshine
and other suspicious manufacturing infrastructure
to create highly efficient conversion methods .
only now they &apos;re both in the process of selling them .
to whom ?
to a west virginia company
that wants total control of the biofuel market in the state .
well , if our profile is right ,
someone didn &apos;t want to deal to go through .
maybe the sellers are sabotaging it to drive down the price .
yeah , but there are easier ways to do that
than resorting to murder .
someone in the community , then ?
malachi kept it a secret
because he didn &apos;t want outsiders to know .
the howards would behave with the same self @-@ interest .
only family members would know .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . if the unsub &apos;s a family member ,
he &apos;s blowing his one big chance to get rich .
unless he were frozen out of the deal .
garcia , run the names on the contracts against both family trees .
done .
anybody excluded ?
there &apos;s a distant cousin on the howard side--
caleb . black sheep .
in and out of jail for larceny .
stealing from farms , specifically .
where is he now ?
no known address .
it &apos;s a good bet cissy knows .
we should pay her a visit .
well , before you do , you should know that
caleb is on an fbi watchlist .
apparently , he was part of an underground organization
that wanted the , quote ,
&quot; real south to secede from the false south . &quot; end quote .
last reported seen deep in the appalachian woods .
oh , my god .
the mountain man .
the legend reid heard from the farmers .
according to them , he was part of the appalachian population
and he wanted to start a second civil war .
they were describing the unsub and we didn &apos;t realize it .
i believe in the god of mercy ,
in the god of compassion .
but that &apos;s not the god i need right now .
i am praying to the god of vengeance .
the god of anger .
the god of locusts and boils and floods .
someone is hurting my family , god .
and i need your power to help me smite my enemy .
thank you .
oh , i got you , you son of a bitch .
her car &apos;s still here , but she isn &apos;t .
between this and the break @-@ in ,
the unsub must have come for her .
he &apos;s never kidnapped a victim before .
why didn &apos;t he kill her on the spot ?
especially considering she pulled the trigger .
this wasn &apos;t a surprise like the previous murder .
she was ready for him .
it didn &apos;t do any good . he still took her .
but to where ?
go ahead , garcia .
i just made a one step forward , two step braha kind of discovery .
caleb howard is on the radar ,
just under a different name . sam caplan .
and , my friends ,
he is not the mountain man anymore .
excuse me , i &apos;m looking for sam caplan .
uh , who &apos;s asking ?
the same people who &apos;d like to talk to caleb howard .
who are you ?
what do you want ? why do you have me here ?
is this about money ?
i &apos;ll give you money . you just name your price .
i don &apos;t want your money .
what do you want ?
i want you to say hello .
to who ?
to you ?
to her .
well , do you recognize her ?
that &apos;s my mama .
i was the mountain man .
i mean , i had joined every movement
to the right of the klan , but that &apos;s not me anymore .
can you account for your whereabouts the past week ?
oh , yeah . one of my kids is on a suicide watch ,
so i &apos;ve actually been sleeping in the building .
i had my phone pre @-@ dialed to 911 just in case of emergency ,
and i butt @-@ dialed it once or twice .
you &apos;re more than welcome to run the record if you &apos;d like .
i &apos;m more curious why you go by sam caplan now .
well , when i was younger , one of the reasons
i would rob a farm or get drunk
or join one of those stupid causes
was because i thought that &apos;s just what howards did , you know ?
you raise hell and ask questions later .
i think it was because i didn &apos;t like myself very much .
you don &apos;t have to change your name for a fresh start .
in this town , you do .
in this town , family is--is destiny , and ,
well , i was embarrassed by mine .
this whole time ,
my team thought you were disowned by your family ,
but i guess it was the other way around .
yes , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s right .
uh , one more thing .
we &apos;re trying to find your aunt cissy .
do you have any idea where she might be ?
none .
do you remember the last time you talked to her ?
yeah . right before i took her advice
and signed the papers to become sam caplan .
she made the suggestion .
cissy howard married into the howard family , right ?
but what was it that she said to malachi in the elevators ?
you visit your daddy &apos;s grave recently ?
you visit yours ?
we thought that was in reference to the family feud .
but she wasn &apos;t born into the family or their feud .
exactly . and garcia couldn &apos;t find any documentation for this woman .
she invented herself 40 years ago .
now , add in that she gave her nephew the idea to change his name ,
and her middle name is magdalene ...
magdalene lee , malachi &apos;s sister .
went missing almost 50 years ago , presumed dead .
now it all makes sense . &quot; you visit your daddy &apos;s grave recently ? &quot;
&quot; you visit yours ? &quot;
it &apos;s the same dad .
that woman raised me from a baby .
she fed me ,
she clothed me , she taught me how to hunt .
she &apos;s real lovely .
yeah , she was smart .
she kept me away from other people
&apos;cause she knew they wouldn &apos;t understand .
then i started asking questions .
how come i don &apos;t look like the others , mama ?
how come i don &apos;t look like you ?
and while her body was wasting away from the cancer ...
she told me ...
about a deal she made .
about a deal she made out here in these woods .
you ?
yeah .
now , i &apos;m going to decide whether you live
or die .
but that depends on how much you confess .
what it must have been like to
see your sister in the elevator after all this time .
what &apos;s it been , 50 years ?
and you never ran into her in town ?
no , i did not .
once she run off , she was dead in my folks &apos; eyes .
why &apos;d she leave ? or was she forced out ?
well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s really your business .
no , but it is my business ,
when your children are dying
and i seem to care more about stopping it than you do .
you don &apos;t tell me that you care more
about my kids than i do , you understand that ?
i just lost my son .
then help me .
why did she leave ?
she got in a family way .
she shamed my folks .
how old was she ?
she was 16 .
but girls in your family have conceived younger .
why was it shameful ?
it was your child .
wasn &apos;t it ?
i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t force her or nothin &apos; .
we was kids .
she loved me .
and i loved her .
anybody else in the family know ?
no .
what happened to the child ?
there was this shack .
we used to go there when ...
we wanted to sin .
am i right ?
and this is the place .
this is where i was conceived ?
yeah . that &apos;s right .
thought nobody &apos;s catch you , didn &apos;t you ?
my mama did .
you liked her looking at you .
you liked it , didn &apos;t you , whore ?
but she knew .
you can &apos;t cheat the laws of god
and the laws of nature forever .
when did you know about me ?
what if we tell mama and daddy ?
they &apos;ll kill us .
they &apos;ll kill us both .
you gotta understand , we were young .
so we come up with a plan .
it wasn &apos;t a good plan .
but it was the best two teenagers could do .
you &apos;d keep the baby .
yeah .
oh , my god !
it hurts so bad !
am i dying ?
something &apos;s wrong .
i can &apos;t stay here for this .
where are you going ? !
malachi ! come back here !
and you ran .
yes , i did .
i ran .
i ran like a coward .
please ...
help me .
someone help me .
oh , god .
oh , god ...
you .
i had no money .
i had no resources .
i wasn &apos;t ready to be a mother .
but she was .
so she said she &apos;d help me .
we made a deal .
she &apos;d keep my secret ...
and she got to keep him .
after i gave you up ,
i rambled the state for 2 , 3 years .
then i heard one of the howard boys was looking for a wife .
so i put myself where he could see me .
i never told him what i &apos;d done , where i &apos;d come from .
once he made a decent woman out of me ,
i prayed to god for a fresh start .
and he gave it to me .
no !
no , no ,
no !
we ain &apos;t done with me yet .
on the night i was born ...
did you name me ?
no .
did you kiss me good @-@ bye ?
no .
did you even hold me ?
did you ? !
yes .
please ...
just let me look at him .
my ...
oh -- my sweet jesus , he &apos;s --
he &apos;s ...
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
he &apos;s perfect .
you never even thought about me , did you ?
i tried not to .
but i knew .
i knew i would pay before my maker for what i &apos;d done .
you were right .
no !
you said if i told you the truth --
i said i &apos;d decide .
and i have .
i &apos;m gonna send you to hell myself .
the shack malachi described fits the geographic profile
of the unsub &apos;s hunting zone .
what are we walking into ?
we &apos;ve already been shot at by the locals once .
according to garcia , the census counter out there
encountered an appalachian woman living in a cabin ,
but she refused to give any information .
the woman must have raised the unsub out there .
that &apos;s how he knows the area so well . it &apos;s his backyard .
that &apos;s exactly where he would have taken cissy .
wait . wait ...
for what ?
you kill me here , they &apos;ll find you .
they &apos;ll know everything you did .
why would you help me ?
&apos;cause i need to pay for my sins .
but i want you to live .
man down ! man down ! fall back !
fall back !
bloodhound has the scent .
ok . we gotta split up .
we can cover more ground . let &apos;s go .
i have eyes on cissy .
he &apos;s got her rigged to a tree .
do not approach . she could be bait .
i &apos;m on my way .
blake !
blake !
blake ? !
blake !
blake , can you hear me ? !
blake !
blake !
start shooting ! start shooting !
where ? !
everywhere !
where &apos;s the body ?
where is he ?
this is ssa rossi with the bau .
we need to drag the lake .
how you doing ?
my hair smells like a dirty sock .
but ... other than that i &apos;m fine .
ok .
how are you doing ?
i just -- i couldn &apos;t breathe .
we put 30 bullets into that water .
ok .
he &apos;s dead , alex .
he &apos;s dead .
we can still press charges against malachi lee .
he opened fire on federal agents .
my humble opinion -- it &apos;s a waste of time .
a jury of his peers don &apos;t take kindly
to government attacks on their homes .
you talk to the families ?
we explained how malachi
was instrumental in the recovery of cissy .
only that just raised more
uncomfortable questions than we could answer .
i would not want to be that poor son of a gun
for all the money in the world .
magdalene ...
it should have been me he killed .
it should have been us both .
something you two want to tell us ?
where did you find this place ?
well , believe it or not ,
my parents used to bring us here when we were kids .
your parents ? they brought you here ?
yeah .
this place is certainly out of the way .
you are gonna love it .
no one is gonna bother us .
no phones . no internet .
no dry cleaning , no takeout .
no calls from your boss .
good point .
you need to wait .
oh , no , no , no . come on .
oh , this is worth waiting for .
sandy ?
sandy .
sandy ?
oh , my god .
what is wrong with you ?
what &apos;s wrong with me ? what &apos;s wrong with you ? what are you doing ?
you &apos;re so sexy when you &apos;re scared .
well , uh , you &apos;re sexy when you --
you have 3 seconds to give me the keys to your car .
