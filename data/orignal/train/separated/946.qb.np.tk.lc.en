第三季 第六集
&lt; i &gt; gabrielle got even . &lt; / i &gt;
did i hurt you , or should i keep trying ?
&lt; i &gt; tom got an idea . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m gonna open up a pizza parlor !
&lt; i &gt; bree got a warning . &lt; / i &gt;
he &apos;s a cold @-@ blooded killer .
&lt; i &gt; the police got a clue . &lt; / i &gt;
those blue marks . i think it &apos;s a phone number .
you &apos;ve reached mike delfino .
this should never have happened !
&lt; i &gt; and the battle for mike &apos;s affection got ugly . &lt; / i &gt;
how do you sleep at night ?
soon , with mike on top of me .
&lt; i &gt; it is often said that confession is good for the soul . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no one knew this better than a certain blonde &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; who had been confessing her sins to &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; father o &apos;malley once a week since she was a child . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; as the years had passed , much to father o &apos;malley &apos;s dismay , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a theme began to emerge . &lt; / i &gt;
i seduced the cable guy again .
i &apos;m having an affair with a folk @-@ singing duo .
last week i let rabbi littman get to third base .
&lt; i &gt; and once she had been forgiven , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; father o &apos;malley would tell edie britt &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to go out into the world and sin no more . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; unfortunately for edie , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; temptation seemed to be ... &lt; / i &gt;
hello , there .
&lt; i &gt; ... everywhere . &lt; / i &gt;
edie , what were we like together ,
before the accident ?
what do you mean ?
you know , were we close ?
honestly ?
we lived about 50 feet from each other
and you barely knew that i existed .
seriously ?
it &apos;s true . you weren &apos;t rude or anything .
we &apos;d wave or exchange hellos as we went to get our mail ,
but you never really looked at me . not really .
i was just another neighbor to you .
well , if we weren &apos;t friends ,
why are you here every day helping me ?
because , from the first moment i laid eyes on you ,
i sort of fell in love with you .
i &apos;m not telling you this because i expect anything ,
so you can just relax . ok ?
ok .
but when you do come back home ,
and we do run into each other when we &apos;re getting our mail
i &apos;d really appreciate it if you &apos;d ...
just look at me .
that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m looking at you now .
&lt; i &gt; yes . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it is often said confession is good for the soul . &lt; / i &gt;
mike delfino and i made out today .
and it was great !
&lt; i &gt; but some confessions are just bragging &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; in disguise . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; there was nothing bree hodge hated more &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; than an unexpected knock at the door . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she &apos;s always certain it would lead to a disagreeable surprise . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; whether it be in the form of a cosmetics saleswoman , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; religious zealots , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or extended family . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but on this day , the surprise awaiting bree &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; was far more disagreeable than she ever could &apos;ve imagined . &lt; / i &gt;
hello , bree .
carolyn .
this isn &apos;t a very good time .
i &apos;m baking .
bree .
oh , hi . we haven &apos;t met . i &apos;m harvey bigsby .
and i brought my wife here to apologize .
it &apos;s a souffle , and timing is everything .
please , please .
she &apos;s been under a great deal of stress
since alma &apos;s disappearance ,
and she really hasn &apos;t been herself .
much of that was due to the mexican painkiller
she purchased online .
but i put a stop to that .
well , orson tells me that the two of you were very close ,
and out of respect for that friendship , i &apos;m all ears .
after thinking it over i realized that , maybe , i was out of line .
definitely out of line
with the terrible accusations that i made .
i &apos;m deeply sorry for the pain that i caused .
i hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me .
well , i can appreciate how difficult
that must have been for you .
apology accepted .
i &apos;m so relieved .
as am i.
you don &apos;t know how rusty my golf game &apos;s gotten
without this one keeping me on my toes .
perhaps we can get together for dinner at the club sometime .
that sounds lovely .
darling , you are amazing , you know that ?
to rise above all that unpleasantness with such dignity .
oh , thank you , darling .
but if you think for one second that i &apos;m gonna break bread
with that malicious pill @-@ popping shrew ,
you &apos;re out of your mind .
hey , susan . whatcha doing ?
i just dropped my trowel . thanks .
all righty , then . you have a nice day .
susan ?
ian . what a surprise .
were you , um ... were you hiding from me ?
uh ... a little . i ...
just the last time we saw each other it was
so awkward and complicated .
water under the bridge .
besides , this is strictly business .
i &apos;m throwing a party for an editor friend from london .
i thought you two should meet .
you can bring a date if you want .
speaking of which , uh , how are things with mike ?
oh , they &apos;re moving along .
it &apos;s a process .
and the blonde woman who &apos;s been visiting him every day ?
is she part of the process ?
edie ?
oh , she &apos;s just a neighbor .
she visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments .
oh ... well , i do hope you can come to the party .
so you can meet my editor friend .
i just don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
right .
well , at least i got to see you .
you have ...
this is ludicrous . the biedermeier armoire .
it &apos;s my understanding that
your client doesn &apos;t even like antiques .
totally immaterial .
it &apos;s a valuable asset .
fine . let &apos;s discuss the kosta boda vase .
nope . it &apos;s a premarital acquisition .
we can verify that with receipts .
it was a gift to mr. solis .
maybe you were sick that day at law school , myron ,
but it &apos;s called &quot; community property . &quot;
don &apos;t patronize me , kenny
we &apos;ll go to the mat on this one .
oh , enough . just give her what she wants .
look , i &apos;m sick of fighting . it &apos;s just stuff .
i &apos;d like a moment with my client .
this has been going on for months . i &apos;m done .
draw up the papers . i &apos;ll sign whatever .
you &apos;re giving me everything i want , just like that ?
just like that .
we expect to see the paperwork by the end of business .
how sweet is that ?
we nailed their asses .
mrs. solis , they completely folded .
that &apos;s the thing . carlos doesn &apos;t fold .
that son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch is up to something .
before you come in , cover your eyes .
tom !
do it .
ok , now .
when i say open , don &apos;t look with your eyes .
look with your imagination .
ok .
ok , open .
oh , dear god .
damn it , you looked with your eyes .
it &apos;s a dump . what are you thinking ?
well , i &apos;ll grant you it &apos;s a fixer @-@ upper .
it &apos;s a burner @-@ downer .
come on , honey . go with me .
we can put in booths with checkered tablecloths .
a jukebox . a big screen to watch sports on .
how could you not see the potential in this place ?
well , i just don &apos;t .
it &apos;s um ... you know how i feel about this pizza thing .
well , hopefully it &apos;ll grow on you .
tom , tell me you didn &apos;t sign a lease !
there &apos;s gonna be a dartboard .
tom ! no !
there were multiple offers . i had to move fast .
you leased it without telling me ?
i didn &apos;t tell you
because i knew you &apos;d try to
talk me out of the best opportunity in my life .
ok . ok .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
you said there were multiple offers . so we can sub @-@ lease .
now , let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
you said you &apos;d support my dream .
my mistake .
i assumed you &apos;d have a dream worth supporting .
i &apos;m gonna stay here tonight .
fine .
two lemonades for the victors .
we keep playing like this , bree ,
and we are a cinch for the finals .
hello , tish .
hello , rebecca .
did you see that ? she just deliberately snubbed me .
maybe she didn &apos;t notice you .
rebecca , i just spoke to her .
call me paranoid ,
but amy griswald did the same thing to me
on the golf course last week .
what is going on ?
you really don &apos;t know ?
no . i have no idea . what ?
tish is very good friends with carolyn bigsby .
carolyn knows tish ?
she knows everyone .
anyway , tish won &apos;t talk to you
because you married orson even after carolyn told you
that he killed his wife .
that is ridiculous .
orson did not kill alma .
and besides ,
carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday .
maybe that hasn &apos;t gotten back to tish .
well , you don &apos;t believe any of that nonsense , do you ?
do you ?
bree , you &apos;re the best doubles partner i &apos;ve ever had .
can we talk about this after the tournament ?
hello . i &apos;d like to make a reservation for this evening
under the names hodge and bigsby .
and , we &apos;ll be needing a table in the center of the room .
of course , ma &apos;am .
how long will daddy be gone ?
that sort of depends on daddy .
are you two mad at each other ?
yeah .
a little . but that &apos;s ok . that &apos;s ok .
we still love each other very much .
but just like kids ,
sometimes grown @-@ ups throw tantrums and need a time @-@ out .
why can &apos;t he take a time @-@ out in his room ?
&apos;cause he decided to take it in his pizza place .
no fair . that sounds fun .
not this pizza place . it &apos;s a rat hole .
but once your dad comes to his senses
and stops being petulant ,
he &apos;ll come home .
what &apos;s petulant ?
it means childish , stubborn ,
careless with my money and your futures .
it &apos;s a grown @-@ up word
and when daddy comes home you &apos;ll learn a new one .
grovel .
they got in a really big fight .
daddy &apos;s sleeping at the restaurant .
no , no , it &apos;s good that you told me , sweet pea .
you keep those little ears open . ok ?
ok . bye , mom .
bye .
hey , that &apos;s for me . i &apos;ll take that .
ok .
i &apos;m beat . i &apos;m gonna take a nap .
hold it . you &apos;re a sweaty mess .
so ? i was working out .
so , you &apos;re not laying on anything in this house
until you take a shower .
fair enough . it &apos;s all yours now , right ?
i don &apos;t know , myron , it &apos;s a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo .
just read it and call me back .
crap !
what ?
why did you put those shorts back on ?
why do you care ?
it &apos;s just that they &apos;re filthy
and i was gonna wash them for you .
you want to wash my shorts ?
i don &apos;t want to ,
but if you wear them one more time
they &apos;re gonna ask me themselves .
wait a minute .
i forgot something in the pocket .
no bleach .
got it .
so it &apos;s a job contract ?
they &apos;re offering him two million over three years
plus stock options .
well , that &apos;s fantastic .
i get half , right ?
hell , no .
if you &apos;re legally divorced when he signs the contract ,
you don &apos;t see a dime .
that conniving , underhanded snake .
thank god i broke into his desk .
at least now we know
why he was so quick to fold on your settlement .
let &apos;s just say something happened
to postpone the divorce .
i would get my share of that two million , right ?
well , in theory .
but how would you manage that ?
i know how carlos thinks .
more importantly , what he thinks with .
was that susan mayer ?
yeah , why ?
mr. delfino asked not to be disturbed .
mike ? it &apos;s me .
are you decent ?
hey , susan .
hey , you .
whatcha doing ?
i sockered mccluskey in to take the kids for a while ,
so i could kick back and catch up with my old friend
margarita .
you care to join us ?
believe me , i would love to .
but i gotta get dinner started for julie .
well then .
you know , what the hell ? she &apos;s 16 .
if she hasn &apos;t figured out how to feed herself by now ,
i &apos;ve failed .
that &apos;s nice .
so where were we ?
you were trying to figure out how to kill edie
without doing time .
oh , right .
i wish paul young was still around . he &apos;d know what to do .
fine , gabby , don &apos;t say hi .
hey . cocktails ? nobody called me ?
it was spur of the moment .
we &apos;re numbing the pain of our miserable lives .
oh . i was trying to do that with exercise ,
but why risk a heart attack ?
make mine a double .
i don &apos;t recognize her .
who is she ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
your number was written on her hand .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t help you .
he &apos;s had a bit of memory loss .
after 2004 , things are fuzzy .
no memory , huh ? that &apos;s convenient .
well , thank you for your time , mr. delfino .
you killed a cop once , didn &apos;t you ?
that was self @-@ defense .
i hope it wasn &apos;t just beginner &apos;s luck .
you want to charge me with something , go ahead .
otherwise , get the hell out of my room !
were you always this angry , mr. delfino ?
or can &apos;t you remember ?
so , do you sell by the slice or do i gotta buy a whole pie ?
what are you doing here ?
i knew how hard you were working .
so i figured i &apos;d bring you a little something to eat
and drink .
you know , i can &apos;t pronounce this wine ,
which means it &apos;s either really expensive ,
or i have had too much .
i can &apos;t believe that lynette doesn &apos;t just love this place .
if you ask me ,
she is a negative nellie .
she &apos;s just being realistic .
i mean , the restaurant business is brutal .
tom . listen to me , ok ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m a very intuitive person .
you have a real aura of success about you .
come on .
i &apos;m serious .
i believe in you ,
tom scavo .
thank you .
hey . what just happened ?
we kissed .
no , you kissed me .
no , you wanted me to .
no , i didn &apos;t .
really ? &apos; cause this is you :
&quot; my wife doesn &apos;t get me . hey , let &apos;s have some more wine .
alone . in a deserted building . &quot;
i was looking to vent . i wasn &apos;t looking for anything more .
ok , but when opportunity knocks
nora , please !
i love my wife .
really ?
you mean the one who thinks that you &apos;re a loser ?
no ,
the one that loves me enough to keep me from screwing up .
i think it &apos;s about time i got back home to her .
you led me on .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
i &apos;m just gonna say it . tequila makes me happy .
yeah , we &apos;re drinking on the porch .
you got a problem with that ?
oh , i know them . they live on cypress .
they just celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary .
show @-@ offs .
don &apos;t worry . it won &apos;t last .
you &apos;re just fooling yourselves !
hey , i know them .
oh , 53 years .
what do you think their secret is ?
i &apos;ll take a wild guess .
the man never opened a pizza place .
oh , i just thought of something .
i &apos;m never gonna celebrate a 53rd wedding anniversary .
i &apos;d have to live into my nineties .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna die
bite on this .
can i tell you guys something ?
something i can only tell you guys ?
god , here she goes again . what grade is he in ?
not what i was gonna say . what i was gonna say ,
is with all his conniving and trickery ,
i still love carlos .
yeah , he &apos;s hot .
anyway ,
what if i never find that passion with anybody else ?
well , maybe you should try to patch things up with him .
nah . i already paid a lawyer .
i &apos;m taking him down .
i brought this on myself . i tell tom ,
&quot; i want you to be your own man . &quot;
but the truth is , i don &apos;t ...
i want him to have what he wants
if it &apos;s what i want .
i &apos;m a bitch with a capital &quot; c. &quot;
no ! no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re a great wife . and a great mother .
although , don &apos;t you have children ?
i had passion with mike .
and drama .
lots of drama .
love isn &apos;t supposed to be that hard .
sweetie .
but you know , with ian
everything was always easy .
that &apos;s the kind of guy i could see myself
living into my nineties with .
so go to ian !
tell him you made the wrong choice .
he &apos;s the one you want to be with .
what have you got to lose ?
excuse me , ladies ?
look , susan , god called you a cab .
i &apos;m looking for 4347 .
ida greenberg ?
i &apos;m ida greenberg .
yeah , you are .
see you later .
go , ida !
go , ida !
susan .
you came .
of course , i came .
oh , i just love your house . it always smells like you .
oh , my gosh .
it &apos;s the thing ? is that tonight ?
well , yes . isn &apos;t that why you &apos;re here ?
no .
no , no . actually , i just ...
i just had something to tell you .
well , of course .
doug , see if you can find judith for me .
thank you .
as long as you &apos;re here , i want you to meet that editor
i was telling you about .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea ,
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t really bring my a @-@ game .
is it hot ?
are you sloshed ?
susan !
is this the susan you &apos;ve been telling us about ?
yes . this is she . could you give us a moment ?
of course .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i just had a few drinks with my girlfriends .
and thank god ,
because it gave me the courage to come over here
and tell you what &apos;s really in my heart .
go on .
but first i think i should use the powder room .
of course . it &apos;s over there .
she seems nice , ian .
oh , yes . she &apos;s absolutely delightful .
oh . i &apos;m so sorry that you had to see that .
i see you &apos;ve met judith .
so , with 100 bucks riding on it , the pressure &apos;s on me now .
i reach into my bag and grab my four iron ,
and bada @-@ bing ! hole in one .
and there &apos;s been no living with him ever since .
did i tell you how hilarious these two are ?
they are a regular barrel of ... tish !
well , hello , bree . carolyn .
oh , do you two know each other ?
that saves me an introduction .
tish , i was wondering
if you need any help with the christmas gala .
last year i was on the decorations of ...
my god , i forgot to call you . what an idiot .
we &apos;ll talk first thing tomorrow .
that would be lovely . thanks .
nice to see you .
nice to be seen .
i need to powder my nose . join me ?
oh , i &apos;d love to .
i &apos;m so happy we did this .
yes , me too .
it &apos;s been a delightful evening .
so , so fun .
could you get us some extra tissues ? thank you .
you know , i realized something just the other day .
you &apos;ve never seen a picture of alma , have you ?
no . why ?
granted , it &apos;s not her best look .
what is all this ?
that &apos;s the police report that alma filed after orson hit her .
it &apos;s all in there , the bruises , contusions , broken wrist .
this is not possible .
photos don &apos;t lie , bree .
is this why you apologized ?
yes .
i wanted you to spend time with me so you can see
i &apos;m not some crazy nut out to get you .
i &apos;m sorry . but if something like that happened again
i could never forgive myself .
thank you .
i had a feeling you might need these .
bring me another one .
hey , buddy .
you want to slow down a little bit .
harvey ?
i &apos;m going through something .
and i don &apos;t have anyone else to talk to about it .
i had an affair .
does carolyn know ?
she has no idea .
i met this girl on a flight from paris ,
and we just , mmm , connected .
i know it sounds crazy , but it was ... love at first sight .
are you still seeing her ?
no , that &apos;s the thing .
a few months ago she stopped returning my calls .
i went by her place and i &apos;ve looked for her everywhere ,
but she &apos;s just disappeared .
i &apos;ll tell you , now i know what you went through with alma .
it &apos;s brutal .
it gets better , trust me .
i just can &apos;t get past it .
i can &apos;t get monique out of my mind .
monique ?
that &apos;s her name .
monique poulier .
isn &apos;t she beautiful ?
she &apos;s very pretty .
they &apos;re back .
you two girls were gone a long time .
everything ok ?
absolutely .
so who wants dessert ?
what have you been up to ?
just a quiet night with the girls .
listen , something happened tonight and got me thinking ,
you mean more to me than any restaurant ever could .
oh , stop right there . i am the one who should apologize .
i have been a bad wife .
no . no . no . no .
you were just trying to keep me from doing something reckless .
any wife can support a husband who never takes risks .
i don &apos;t want that kind of husband .
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m gonna be that kind of wife .
so , you open your pizza place .
and we will find a way to make it work .
you don &apos;t know how much it means to me to hear that .
i love you ! ooh !
mmm .
so what happened tonight ?
ok , but don &apos;t react until i &apos;ve told you the whole story .
and remember , it &apos;s actually a good thing
because it brought us back together .
ding dong .
i don &apos;t know what tom told you ,
but he came on to me .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t quite catch that .
why don &apos;t you just come on over here
and say that to me again ?
stay away from me .
i &apos;ve been trying to stay away from you .
mom ?
everything &apos;s all right .
so you can just go back into your room and play .
kayla , don &apos;t move .
ok . never mind .
i &apos;m leaving .
first i &apos;m just gonna give your mom a hug .
your association with my family is over .
when kayla visits , you drop her at the end of the block .
you will never again see my husband .
and if you try to ,
i will do to your spine what i just did to your front door .
nod if you understand .
and you , i &apos;m gonna see you on saturday , right ?
don &apos;t forget your swimsuit .
good morning !
you &apos;re looking bright @-@ eyed and ... bushy .
did you stay here all night ?
well , i slept on the sofa .
when i brought you home you were still ,
as you americans say , &quot; tossing your tacos . &quot;
oh , please .
keep the food references to a minimum .
bless you .
so what else happened ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what ,
i &apos;ll repeat what you said last night ,
and you say whether it was you or the booze talking .
you ready ?
you said you missed me . susan or booze ?
susan .
you said it was a mistake breaking up with me
and that you wanted to start again . susan or booze ?
susan .
then you said that you wanted to dress me up
like a schoolboy and spank my naughty bottom .
susan or booze ?
i didn &apos;t say that !
yeah , all right , then . but if you had ,
susan or booze ?
a little of both , so &quot; booze @-@ an . &quot;
detective ridley .
your jane doe in the morgue
is named monique poulier .
who &apos;s this ?
just before she died ,
she was having an affair with a man named harvey bigsby .
you got that ?
yeah .
your name ?
i &apos;ll need to bring you in for a statement .
carlos , could you come help me ?
i &apos;m watching the game .
it &apos;ll just take a second . please .
what , gabby ?
you look ... nice .
oh , thanks .
i &apos;m meeting some new friends .
my zipper &apos;s stuck . can you help me ?
man , this is really stuck .
it &apos;s like somebody put super glue on it or something .
huh . weird .
well , you know , i don &apos;t want to be late ,
so i should , um , probably change .
carlos , this old thing .
you &apos;ve seen it all before .
i &apos;m just gonna wear the little blue number .
will you hand me those stockings ?
i &apos;ve got a raggedy nail .
you &apos;re gonna have to help me put those on .
are you sure about that ?
well , i &apos;d do it myself , but i don &apos;t want to get a snag .
it &apos;s been a long time .
really ? it seems like yesterday to me .
you want me to help you hook that ?
sure .
why not , for old time &apos;s sake ?
what about your new friends ?
i decided i &apos;d rather catch up with an old one .
mr. bigsby , detective ridley , homicide .
i understand you know her .
ah , yes , we were sleeping together .
can we do this somewhere else ?
sure .
carlos , do you think we &apos;re making a mistake ?
what do you mean ?
the whole divorce thing .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t go through with it .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re gonna find
this kind of passion with anyone else .
are you saying you want to stay together ?
yeah .
yeah , i guess i am .
why don &apos;t we just put all of this behind us
and stay together ?
what do you say ?
oh , baby .
if you knew how long i &apos;ve waited to hear you say th ...
what ? what &apos;s so funny ?
oh , man .
i thought i &apos;d get through this without cracking up ,
but you are just too funny .
there &apos;s a little something that i need to own up to .
i know that the only reason you slept with me
was because i got a new job .
you got a new job ?
honey , that &apos;s wonderful !
gabby , please . you &apos;re a model .
not a modellactress .
there is no job .
the contracts in my desk are fake .
i mailed them to myself .
what ? why would you do that ?
well , let &apos;s see .
you did this just to get me in bed ?
no . i did it because i knew you &apos;d smell money
and come crawling back .
then i could turn you down
and walk out on my own terms .
your terms ?
you don &apos;t get to screw around on me ,
take my money , and then walk away without a scratch .
i want you hurting , baby .
and judging by the look on your face
when you saw two million imaginary dollars disappear ...
... i succeeded .
you are a bastard !
better a bastard than a whore .
oh , god !
hello ? there &apos;s been an accident . my husband , he ...
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
carlos ?
honey ?
carlos ?
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s on .
&lt; i &gt; there &apos;s a place in st. timothy &apos;s church &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; where sinners go to confess their sins . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and once they &apos;re done , they expect absolution . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but the truth is , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; not all confessions are worthy of such forgiveness . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; most who unveil hidden agendas &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; deserve the condemnation they receive . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; most who disclose vengeful motives &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; merit the punishment that follows . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; only the truly repentant &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; have any right at all to expect a second chance . &lt; / i &gt;
come on , what &apos;s my surprise ?
i thought you &apos;d never get here .
&lt; i &gt; which is why it &apos;s best to think twice &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; before you confess . &lt; / i &gt;
mike ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
tha ... that girl who died .
&lt; i &gt; especially if you don &apos;t know what it is &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you &apos;re confessing to . &lt; / i &gt;
i think i knew her .
