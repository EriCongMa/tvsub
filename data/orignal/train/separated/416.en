No don't do this! Don't do it!
No! No! No!
No! Why are you doing this?!
Get me out of here!
Where'd you go?
Why are you doing this to me?!
Please don't do this man.
No!
No please!
Can't somebody help me?
Help me!
No!
Help!
Hey Jack are you ready? We gotta go.
Hey where's the costume?
It's itchy.
Did you try the long sleeves on underneath?
I don't want to be spider-man anymore.
Why not?
I don't know.
Ok. Well
you have to make up your mind by tomorrow ok?
Ok.
Ok.
You did a good job on the cookies.
Teamwork right?
Teamwork right.
Can I have one?
You want a cookie?
Can I have a cookie?
What do you want black cat or a pumpkin?
Black cat.
Black cat. Good choice.
The cool thing about Halloween
Is that it's a uniquely American holiday.
I mean despite it's obvious origins in the celtic festival
of Samhain and the Christian all saints day
It really is a melting pot
of various immigrants' traditions and beliefs.
It became a little more
commercialized in the 1950s with trick-or-reat
And today it rivals only christmas in terms of popularity.
All I asked was what he was doing this weekend.
I'm toying with the notion
Of either going to the edgar allan poe shadow puppet theater
or the reenactment of the 19th century phantasmagoria.
I don't want to know.
Oh yeah you do.
Phantasmagorias are these amazing pre-cinema projected ghost shows
Invented in France
where the showman attempted to spook the audience
Using science magic. And it just so happens
That I have an extra ticket.
Tempting.
Guys I wouldn't have to worry
About losing my feminine curves
If you all paid more attention
To all the trees we're consuming around here.
When did you become an eco-freak?
Baby I was born green.
We're going to Detroit.
It's Halloween weekend.
Arson investigators have noticed a 3-year trend
In the days leading up to Halloween.
Devil's night.
This unsub is killing only these 3 days out of the year.
How's he doing it?
He's burning his victims alive.
He's abducting seemingly random people
And dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town.
He struck again last night.
Yeah. Tony torrell 40.
He lives in the suburbs but he was found 20 miles away
In the Rivertown district.
He's attacking the city at its most vulnerable time.
What does he do during the rest of the year?
He's dormant.
You know
arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25
Who can't stay away from fire.
Yeah they're addicted to it and there's no rehab.
And they target dwellings not people.
So you're saying he burns
his victims alive but he's not an arsonist?
Fire is simply his weapon.
And devil's night gives him the perfect cover to kill.
Then we've got 48 hours before he disappears again.
Well his last victim was athletic.
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.
The offender must be just as strong
Or might have an upper hand if he's younger.
Still how does he transport his victims across the city
And get them inside buildings
Without being noticed?
Niccolo Machiavelli wrote
"If an injury has to be done to a man
"It should be so severe
that his vengeance need not be feared."
Now I thought devil's night was halloween eve.
The moniker "Devil's night" Is somewhat deceiving.
In Detroit
it's actually a 3-day
citywide cultural phenomenon
Complete with masks chaos and costumes.
Say that 3 times fast.
Sounds like mardi gras.
Yeah a violent one.
Vandals and amateur arsonists literally
set hundreds of fires.
Who burns their own city?
It started as pranks in the 1930s
but escalated in the 1970s with disenfranchised youth.
Well given today's economy
it must be a free-for-all.
They've got record-breaking unemployment
and foreclosures
Leaving a lot of displaced desperate people.
And every single one of these victim
suffered unimaginable pain.
I'm sure that's what gets him off watching them burn.
It gives him power and control.
The top of the whodunit list is first responders.
Firefighters arson investigators
cops and paramedics.
Civil servants with a hero complex.
All of whom will be helping us.
This guy's angry.
Aren't they all?
Not like this.
Have you seen these?
Extreme anger usually manifests from a quick temper
but this guy's patient.
I'm gonna ask Garcia to notify us
the minute that someone's reported missing.
Burns 3 people annually.
It's like his christmas.
And the rest of the year he just plans--
targeting his victims and then choosing
the buildings he wants to kill them in.
There's a flaw in his plan.
We know about it.
We're stretched as it is
but we've set up a joint task force
with the Detroit P.D. to catch this guy.
It's pretty extensive.
I'd say don't profile me
but you're in a roomful of suspects right?
A city full.
Victims abducted across every socioeconomic divide.
And this son of a bitch
is about to burn a few of them alive.
Problem is we've gotta catch up.
And we know he's gonna be watching.
Well we're gonna bust him this year.
We've got two agents on the way
to last night's crime scene.
Great. I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
It gets dark early this time of year.
And we'll head to the morgue.
Hope you have a strong stomach.
Gasoline was the accelerant?
Gas vapors collect in a low enclosed space.
When he ignited those vapors burned down to his bone.
We call this a fourth-degree burn.
There's a fracture on the back of his skull.
That's right.
Was that postmortem?
No it was antemortem bruising.
He was struck from behind.
Blitz attack.
What's this on her face?
Charred fabric. All of the victims
have the same material on them.
The fire fused the original garment to his flesh
then burned away leaving behind these remains.
He's covering their faces?
That's my best guess yes.
He doesn't want his victims looking at him
Even though he wants to watch them die.
It could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.
Now wouldn't a guy like this
want to see the terror in their eyes?
Instead he keeps them in the dark.
He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
It's an execution.
It's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
It's completely isolated.
He can beat torture or burn somebody
and nobody would hear it.
I never thought the FBI would be here
for our fine city's tradition.
I'm Al Garner with the DFD.
Agents Morgan and Prentiss.
I guess devil's night keeps you pretty busy huh?
Not as much as it did in the eighties.
Used to get up to 600.700 fires back then.
In 3 days?
Down to 115 last year.
It still takes everything we got
but fortunately we've had some help.
Have the police increased their patrols in the Rivertown district?
I wish they could but the city's reeling from budget cuts.
No. Detroit's finest is a community group
with over a thousand volunteers.
A thousand volunteers?
Well that just added another thousand names to Garcia's list.
Do you think he's one of them?
Can't rule anyone out.
What is this place?
It's an old engine factory.
It's massive.
And medieval.
From the industrial age
when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs
than any place else in the world.
This is where we found Tony's charred remains.
The char pattern tracks back to here.
That's where he stood when he started the fire.
Not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
Yeah except he didn't want that.
He needs to watch the show.
This is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
So he watches as long as he can.
Yeah but fire's unpredictable.
Every second in here he's putting his own life at risk.
And this guy's obviously confident
that he can get out of here before it's too late.
But there was a fire alarm.
My men were here in 5 minutes.
And he knew it.
How?
This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
He probably knows response times
or at least listens to them.
All units be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 East Mills.
This is your man DJ Cutz with an instant blast.
The feds are in town cracking down on this year's devil's night.
So I'd advise everyone to stay off of the streets
and keep them radios locked to FM 99 Detroit.
This CITY is being WATCHED by Detroits' Finest.
The first time I looked at these victims on the map
none of it made sense.
7 different victims various ages sex and ethnicity.
What do you see now?
The first victim...
Often tells us the most.
Tommy Proctor.
Well his rap sheet is longer than the Nile.
It looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?
Two things. First of all his body wasn't found for days.
He was buried deep in the building.
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
Because the unsub didn't realize
how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill. He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.
Which definitely makes it personal.
If he knew the first victim
it's a good chance he knew them all.
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to Tony Torrell's wife.
How you doing?
Uh...I'm fine.
Uh I'm here to see agent Rossi.
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm agent Prentiss.
Oh I'm Kiersten Torrell.
Uh...my husband Tony was killed last night.
I know.
And I'm very sorry.
May I sit down?
Oh yeah.
Are--are you working on his case?
Yes I am.
Is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
Kiersten uh your husband was very badly burned.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you mean he was burnt?
The person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
Was Tony set on fire alive?
We don't know that--
Oh my God.
Oh my God this can't be happening.
Ohh...next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry.
Are you married?
No I'm not and I can't imagine what you're going through.
But everything you tell us
can help us find the person who did this to Tony.
I know this is hard
but I want you to try to remember that
when you're talking to agent Rossi.
Now I'd like you to close your eyes and relax.
I want to walk you through
an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
What like hypnosis?
No no no. Not at all.
Now just close your eyes and do the best that you can. Ok?
All right.
Think about last night.
You and Tony you went to the Halloween festival in Greektown.
What time was it?
Uh around 9:30.
Crowded?
Yeah.
Uh there were drums and loud music
some people wore costumes.
Tony and I went to the festival every year.
We actually met there when we were in high school.
But this year we decided not to dress up.
What is it?
A kid dressed in a mask jumped out scared me.
It made Tony laugh.
Where's his Mama?
What type of mask?
Uh round like a baby.
Ok. What do you see next?
Fire.
They were grilling lamb
And uh people were cheering.
All right. It was a Greek restaurant.
Baby me and gyros?
No thanks.
What?
I'm gonna go check out this Mexican food.
Oh baby no.
Baby I'm be right back.
All right. I'll come and get you.
All right.
Now do you remember anyone in the crowd
anyone that didn't fit in?
No.
But to be honest I was already looking at the menu.
All right that's good. Now don't look up from the menu.
Just listen to me.
When you love someone and they step away
there's an instinctive response to glance up
to make sure that they're still there.
Now you did that last night even if you don't remember.
Ok. You're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what I'm getting. I'm getting the gyro.
Kiersten where's Tony?
He's at the mexican restaurant.
Is someone around him?
Yes.
Uh but I can't really make out his face.
What about his body? Is it young? Is it old?
Uh...25 maybe.
Wait.
He's wearing a mask.
Like the kid?
No no no no no.
It only covers one side of his face.
His ear is gone.
And um...
What do you see?
It's a black guy.
He's black.
You make him sound like he's Freddy Krueger or something.
No but I do think he's severely burned.
It explains why he chooses this time of the year.
He doesn't have to hide his scars.
What about his victims?
He's punishing them for wronging him.
Wronging him? What about his second victim?
Have you looked at Josephine Davis' life?
She was the nicest woman in the world.
How did she wrong this guy?
He's had interactions with all of his victims
some more personal than others.
So he's acting out of revenge.
Kiersten and Tony didn't even speak to him.
Maybe not that night
but at some point in the past.
Now wait a minute.
Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.
You think these couples represent the happiness he covets?
Or something he lost.
He's a young guy with a deformity.
Major insecurities come with that.
A trauma like that would be devastating for him
and anyone in his life.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy!
Please please daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy please!
Do you know how rare it is for an arsonist to be a burn victim?
Less than 3.5%.
This guy's not an arsonist.
He's a serial killer who uses fire.
And that choice of weapon tells us that he's aggressive
driven and destructive just like fire itself.
But why would someone so controlling
choose the most unpredictable weapon?
This juxtaposition tells us
there's more going on with him than we realize.
He's probably experienced some kind of loss
these past few years that started him down this path.
We should look at accidents where couples were burned.
We're talking about hundreds of fires.
Focusing on ones where gasoline was the accelerant.
Leaving his victims in the heart of Rivertown
in the center of these buildings themselves
may be subconscious on his part
But it says that this affected his very core.
All right hold on. Somebody else has just been abducted.
How do we know this is our guy?
Because his daughter said a monster took her daddy away.
Kaman!
Kaman come on man.
What are you doing? My little girl's back there.
You gotta let me go.
The victim's name is Christopher Edwards.
He's 35. He lives in the suburbs.
What part?
Birmingham.
How far is that from the Rivertown district?
Not more than 40 minutes.
He might already be inside.
Let's lock it down. We'll trap him.
I'm going down there.
I'll go with you.
Garcia have Detroit P.D. Set up roadblocks.
Got it.
Chris Edwards is a husband he's a father
he's a general contractor.
I would check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
Ok that is a humungous list. What do you want me to do with it?
Anything that requires flames--plumbers electricians welders.
Did he fire a welder recently?
Ok. Uh he's been using Vinnie's welding and fence
but he hasn't hired them back in months.
List of employees coming up.
It's still a lofty handful.
Ok we think he's been following the investigation.
Look at volunteers with detroit's finest.
Ok I'm crossing employees with volunteers.
Nothing.
Come on baby girl keep checking.
There's gotta be a connection here.
Ok I'm gonna long-shot it and I'm gonna cross
The michigan business directory with the payroll company
And see if I still got what it takes to find stuff.
And I do. His name's Kaman Scott.
You got an address?
I'm working on that.
Kaman.
Kaman come on man.
Kaman you gotta let me go. Please let me go.
What do you want?
I'll give you anything you want. You want money?
You want a job?
Just don't do anything stupid man all right?
Damn it come on man!
Ok from the look of kaman scott's early years
He was on a fast track to
be some kind of hoodlum bad boy super convict
But something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune
'cause then there's no arrests there's no suspicions
There's no sign of rehab but he totally cleaned up.
Maybe that's when he met someone.
Has he ever been arrested with a man named Tommy Proctor?
Yeah once uh 2002...
Yikes and then they collided again in 2005
Like literally collided.
Kaman was in an accident and his car blew up.
Well there's your gas accelerant.
He was hit by that guy Tommy Proctor.
There's your revenge.
Twist of fate. The life he left behind came back to haunt him.
So tommy walks away without a scratch
And kaman suffers a ton of third-degree burns
Had a boatload of skin grafts
was in a coma for a couple of months
Lost his apartment.
Oh and then there's that guy--
His landlord was tony torrell.
So we were right. He does have a revenge list.
What about family friends acquaintances?
No that kaman is a lone wolf.
And his address just came up.
Big bad lives at 5923 Mills.
Clear here.
Clear.
It's like a cave.
This guy hides out all year long.
With burns like that he's probably sensitive to light.
And his own skin.
When you look around there's not a mirror in sight.
This guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
There's nothing personal in here.
Well we said he'd have nothing to live for.
For a planner like Kaman tonight's abduction was irrational.
He went on private property and took Chris Edwards
With a witness present.
Maybe he's finally starting
to feel the pressure and he's reactive.
More than that he's meticulous.
He'd have a plan if he got cornered.
He'd have an endgame.
Well he already killed the man he blames for his accident.
The other victims are slights compared to that.
And now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
The one who drives all of this.
The one who broke his heart.
Yeah but who the hell is that?
I swear I won't tell anybody about this.
Aah! Aah! Son of a bitch!
Oh god!
I'm sorry man.
I'm so sorry.
It wasn't my call.
No! What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
No kaman please no!
Oh god! Let me go!
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
He was fired 7 months ago.
Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
Anything in the van?
Welding equipment cans of gasoline.
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
Without his car he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore.
Then he's gonna lash out again.
Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
Oh jeez we gotta find out who she is.
If this guy's feeling cornered all bets are off.
Tonight's his last chance to
get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
She's most likely his next target.
Garcia we're gonna send you some photographs.
What do you want me to do with them?
Blow up the background see if you can find anything
That tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.
Uh-uh! We're closed!
No you are not.
Not to me.
Boy what's wrong with you? Get out.
Not tonight.
Where is she?
Where is Tracy?
Kaman I said...
get out.
I can't.
I can't do that tonight. They comin' after me.
What have you done?
I just need to see her.
I told you don't come back in here.
It's over.
Son...
you need to get some help.
Don't you do it old man!
Where is she?!
You go to hell!
You gonna burn.
Garcia.
Friends we're on 3-way.
What's going on?
Hotch we found some pictures
of Kaman's girlfriend at his apartment.
So I blew up those pictures. In one of them
she appears to be in a restaurant
so I zoomed in on the sign that says "O" apostrophe "S"
cross-checked that with restaurants in the area
and there are 5 diners.
3 are in the suburbs
2 are in Highland Park and one is in Rivertown.
What's the name?
Jay-Mo's.
And this appears to be Kaman's and that girl's
favorite place 'cause all the pictures were taken there.
Have you heard of Jay-Mo's?
It's a few blocks from here.
Good work Garcia. We're on the way.
You're sick Kaman.
We done talkin'.
This ain't the way.
You tell me where she is.
She ain't with you I know where she is.
Don't do it. Leave Tracy alone.
Kaman.
It's too late for her.
And it's too late for you.
Kaman!
Hotch a fire alert just went out
it's at Jay-Mo's diner.
Backup's on the way.
There isn't time.
All units 565 East Jefferson.
I repeat all units 565 East Jefferson.
This is lieutenant Al Garner
requesting available fire and EMS units.
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.
Repeat all units 565 East Jefferson.
BP's 84 over 36.
The owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
He's in and out of consciousness.
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up
for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
Did Kaman Scott do this to you?
We have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
Do you know this girl?
Tracy. Tracy.
Don't let him.
Please stop him.
Is Tracy nearby?
Yes. Yes. Get him.
Go go.
Resuscitator.
Ok let's move.
Hotch you ran into a burning building?
I didn't have a choice.
Her name's Tracy. Kaman's trying to find her.
That man put his life on the line to protect her.
So she means something to him.
She means everything.
Got to finish the dishes.
All right well hurry up.
Jay-Mo's real name is James Morris.
He was married to Loretta Butler.
Does he have any children?
Yes they has one daughter.
Her name is Tracy Anderson. She was born in 1987.
Why does she have a different last name?
When James' wife died
his sister Susan Anderson adopted Tracy.
And where is she now?
She currently lives in Ohio.
No he says she's nearby.
Where do the Andersons live?
Uh Indian Village.
That's 3 miles away.
Let's go.
Here you go hon. I found a few more glasses for you.
Tom.
Oh my god Tom!
Where is Tracy?
Sorry. I keep trying the Anderson house
but the line's busy.
He must already be there.
Garcia have any fires been reported in the area?
Negative but medics and fire suppression are on the way.
Good. Tell them to stand by.
Roger that. Sir there's one more thing I gotta tell you.
What is it?
Now let's just get honest with each other.
Where's Tracy?
She's not here.
You're lying.
I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth.
We have no reason to lie.
It's been 5 years Kaman.
She's moved on with her life.
Why can't you just accept that?
Shut up!
I'm calling backup.
If anybody moves we're in trouble.
We need a shooter.
We're here.
Your man wants everyone to hold their position.
We need a single rifle.
I say again all units hold your position.
Copy that.
This is the street.
Hotch is going inside.
And he's on his own.
Hotch won't do anything to spin him.
It's not Kaman I'm worried about.
This isn't his first time at the dance.
We gotta trust him on this.
Kaman why are you doing this?
We never did anything to you.
You kept Tracy away from me.
Look what you've done.
What you're about to do now.
I wasn't always like this.
People don't change Kaman.
This is all your fault.
Baby you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you.
Baby look at me. Look at me.
Kaman.
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
I'm sorry.
That's not good enough!
After the accident
I had to get my life together.
And what about my damn life?
It took me 2 years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
Kaman...
What happened to you?
What do you think happened to me?
Mommy?
Who else is here?
Mommy what's wrong?
That's my sister's son.
Uh go back upstairs baby. Go back upstairs.
Wait wait wait.
He said mama.
The boy's confused Kaman.
Is that your son?
No Kaman.
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
Kaman drop it.
You shoot me I drop this and they burn. Then what?
You move you die.
I'm already dead. I ain't got nothin' else to live for.
Tracy you need to tell him.
Tell me what?
What the hell's going on here?
He needs to know.
Kaman...
While you were in a coma
I found out I was pregnant.
No...
I didn't know what to do.
I thought you were gonna die.
Baby I'm so sorry.
You're telling me...
That's my son?
Kaman you don't want to do this in front of your son.
Put it down.
Baby if you don't do it for me do it for him.
Don't you want to know his name?
What's your name?
Daniel Kaman Anderson.

Dad don't look at me.
I'm not looking. Are you almost ready?
Yes.
Do you need any help?
No.
Ok.
Whoa. That is definitely not spider-man.
He's not a real superhero.
He's not?
Ok I give up.
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm you daddy.
Come here buddy.
Ok.
