looks like your five @-@ o task force is making an impact .
laura !
laura did not want anybody to know that she was
sending me evidence from my father &apos;s toolbox .
how do i tell stan that i &apos;m leaving ,
and that i &apos;m pregnant with your child ?
that &apos;s the woman i saw .
that &apos;s her . number five .
i think the governor &apos;s hiding something .
tell me you didn &apos;t break into the governor &apos;s house .
i know what you did !
i have everything under control .
steve mcgarrett , you are under arrest .
let him go .
i can &apos;t let him go .
yes , you can . we have jurisdiction . we are five @-@ o.
you don &apos;t understand . there is no five @-@ o anymore .
mcgarrett .
you have a visitor .
why are you smiling at me ?
you &apos;re not wearing a tie , it suits you .
no , i &apos;m not wearing a tie .
&apos;cause there &apos;s no dress code for an out @-@ of @-@ work cop .
you get any leads on wo fat ?
uh , no . nothing yet .
how &apos;s your family ? how &apos;s rachel ?
she getting morning sickness yet ?
yeah , she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s excellent .
listen , i know you don &apos;t like visitors ,
but this guy wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer , so ...
let me guess , the governor had it coming ?
you , uh , you didn &apos;t have to come down here , sir .
you okay , son ?
i &apos;m fine .
nothing hell week didn &apos;t train me for .
your man tells me the lieutenant governor &apos;s
trying to move up your trial .
i heard . the new guy , he wants to show the public
he &apos;s a zero tolerance type ,
so convicting me of governor jameson &apos;s murder
is his first order of business .
well , we are here to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
is there something i can help you with ?
we know it was you .
it &apos;s just a matter of time
before you &apos;re trading places with mcgarrett .
congratulations on the promotion , lieutenant kelly .
smart move , rejoining hpd .
you got one hour .
my brother &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t he ?
then so &apos;s your father .
no !
hello , steve .
now listen to me very carefully , steve ...
prisoner , step back !
step back !
you hear me , steve ?
you hear me ? !
you should have to arrest yourself for
breaking that seal , lieutenant .
it &apos;s okay .
i brought a spare .
you &apos;re chin ho kelly , right ?
john mcgarrett spoke highly of you .
joe white .
how do you know john ?
we served together .
he saved my ass more times than i &apos;d like to remember .
i &apos;m here to return the favor .
so . what &apos;s up , buddy ? you &apos;ve been ducking me for about a week now .
i &apos;ve been a little busy .
you &apos;ve been busy ? what are you doing ,
putting more of your friends behind bars ?
so you think i had a choice ?
mcgarrett was standing over
the governor &apos;s body with a gun in his hand , danny .
i had a full swat team right behind me ,
who saw exactly the same things .
now , what was i supposed to do ?
that &apos;s a good question . i &apos;m glad you asked .
because what i think that you should have done is let five @-@ o investigate ,
instead of dismantling it .
instead of running off and joining hpd .
running off ?
yeah .
i knew that i could help mcgarrett more as a cop
than as an unemployed civilian .
are you two done ?
because i &apos;m fairly certain that this conversation
isn &apos;t helping steve one bit .
i saw wo fat at the funeral this morning .
hold on . you saw ... why didn &apos;t you arrest him ?
with what ? we got nothing .
ballistics confirmed the gun that mcgarrett had in his hand
was the murder weapon .
and since it was freshly discharged
when wo fat put it into his hand ,
lab found traces of gsr on mcgarrett &apos;s clothing .
the key is gonna be proving that he didn &apos;t fire it .
okay . hold on .
what about the security cameras ?
no , they were down .
steve disabled them all during his break @-@ in .
so you got no footage of the real killer coming or going ?
no .
all right .
steve got blasted in the neck with a stun gun .
he got marks on his neck . what about that ?
prosecuting attorney will have that tossed out .
mcgarrett took out the governor &apos;s
entire security detail . they can easily make the case
that any physical trauma occurred then .
sounds like we got a lot of work ahead of us .
do you guys have a dossier on this wo fat character ?
jenna kaye does . she used to work for the cia .
well , i &apos;ll try not to hold that against her .
where can i find her ?
mahalo inn . room 17 .
i know the place . do me a favor .
give her a ring , tell her i &apos;m on my way .
he , uh , he trained steve .
so it &apos;s his fault ?
i spoke to kono , and she &apos;s not taking her suspension very well .
yeah .
ia &apos;s not backing off .
the investigation &apos;s still ongoing .
they want her badge , danny .
you , my friend , are a ray of sunshine today .
it &apos;s really good to see you .
yeah .
williams .
when ?
okay .
don &apos;t move . i &apos;m on my way .
what , this was your plan all along ?
huh ? frame mcgarrett , get him in here so you could take him out ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to kill him . i was trying to save his life .
t @-@ trying to save his life ?
believe me , if i wanted to gut the man ,
i would &apos;ve done it .
i stabbed him in the abdomen , low and to the center ,
avoiding all the vital organs .
why would you do that ?
because ...
that would give him the best chance to escape .
escape ?
what the hell you talking about , escape ? what do you mean ?
i told mcgarrett that wo fat ordered me to kill him .
if wo fat wanted to kill mcgarrett ,
why didn &apos;t he just do it when he killed the governor ?
you &apos;re the detective , i &apos;m sure you can figure it out .
he needed the governor out of the way
so he pinned her murder on mcgarrett .
and when mcgarrett &apos;s killed in prison by the man
he put away , no one asks any questions . is that it ?
you two catch on fast .
still doesn &apos;t explain why you didn &apos;t follow orders .
i may be a soulless bastard , detective , but i &apos;m no fool .
wo fat is making one last deal ,
and then he &apos;s going to disappear .
he &apos;s not going to do that without tying up loose ends .
and by loose ends , you mean you , right ?
unless mcgarrett kills him first .
still no sign of steve , but hpd &apos;s out in full force .
they want to deploy me in the field to help coordinate .
okay , listen . i need to set up shop here , at my place .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
heard about mcgarrett .
what does he think he &apos;s doing ?
he &apos;s going after wo fat .
okay . so we have to help him .
yeah , that &apos;s gonna be a little difficult ,
considering who we &apos;re dealing with .
okay , steve will not contact us .
he won &apos;t want us implicated for aiding and abetting .
okay . so we have to find wo fat first .
will ling might know where he is .
will ling ? who &apos;s will ling ?
one of wo fat &apos;s lapdogs
who happened to , uh , drop his wallet at the cemetery .
nice .
if we follow this guy , he &apos;s bound to lead us to his boss .
i can run his id ,
trace his cell , run surveillance .
how are you gonna do that ?
you don &apos;t have access to hpd &apos;s database .
i &apos;ll use your password .
oh ! that &apos;s not a good idea .
what ?
you &apos;re not carrying a badge anymore , kono .
i can &apos;t guarantee hpd back up .
you guys are my back up .
definitely been hanging out with mcgarrett too long now .
okay , so do we have a plan or what ?
yes , we have a plan .
you go after ling-- let us know if you find anything .
in the meantime , we need to find mcgarrett
before hpd does , okay ?
the car bomb in hangzhou , that was him ?
you heard of it ?
yeah , you could say that .
this wo fat likes to get his hands dirty .
now that we &apos;ve exposed him ,
he &apos;s taken a more active role in his own self @-@ preservation .
this is very thorough .
you seem to know him pretty well .
this one was personal to me .
it &apos;s danny .
hey .
what happened ?
yeah , i &apos;ll tell him right now .
mcgarrett escaped from prison .
patience was never his strong suit .
well , we should get going .
they &apos;re gonna need our help .
these things belonged to john mcgarrett , right ?
yeah . what does that matter ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m gonna take this , if you don &apos;t mind .
sure . where are you going ?
mcgarrett needs our help .
he &apos;ll be fine .
what do you mean , he &apos;ll be fine ?
how do you know ?
i trained him .
911 . what is your emergency ?
commander mcgarrett ?
commander mcgarrett , can you hear me ?
max , least you can do
after patching me up is call me steve .
oh . well , thank you ...
steve .
i &apos;m sorry i broke in your house .
i , um ...
i didn &apos;t really have anywhere else to go .
no apology is necessary .
in fact , i &apos;m quite humbled that you feel comfortable
enough to come to me .
however , i am curious as to how you acquired that wound .
i &apos;m guessing that it was
a crudely sharpened piece of unsterilized metal ...
i got shanked in prison , max .
so then ...
you didn &apos;t come by that uniform in a legal manner ?
you don &apos;t watch the news , do you ?
i try not to .
it &apos;s very scary .
my roommate is visiting family on the mainland .
you two are approximately the same size .
thanks , buddy .
who is it ?
it &apos;s all right .
max , don &apos;t get the door .
it &apos;s all right .
max , don &apos;t answer the door !
what the hell is the matter with you , huh ?
what is the matter with you ? !
breaking outta jail , taking out a cop ? !
have you lost your mind ?
why are you yelling at me ?
i &apos;m not yelling at you !
actually , you were expressing yourself in a very loud manner .
hey , zip it , kermit , okay ? have you lost your mind ?
what choice did i have , danny ?
what choice did you have ?
what does that even mean ? !
you all right ?
thank you for asking , chin . yeah , i &apos;m all right !
thanks to max .
mahalo for calling .
anybody follow you guys ?
undercover unit tried to , but we managed to shake the tail .
hey , heard you stole a squad car-- where &apos;d you ditch it ?
a few blocks south . it &apos;s behind a construction site .
i &apos;ll take it up to the north shore , distract hpd .
you are hpd , chin . you remember ?
hey , just &apos; cause the badge says hpd ,
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m not five @-@ o.
you know that .
you did what you had to do , okay ?
right now , i want to find wo fat . you understand ?
kono &apos;s following one of his guys right now .
as soon as we get eyes on him , we &apos;ll be there .
hello . yeah , he &apos;s right here .
i &apos;ll put you on speakerphone .
steve , you okay ?
yes , sir .
where are you ?
i found someone you need to talk to .
5423 puuikena drive .
i &apos;ll be waiting out front .
copy that . i &apos;m on my way .
whoa @-@ whoa . what do you mean , you &apos;re on your way ?
you &apos;re not on your way anywhere .
you &apos;re a fugitive , you remember that ?
you heard the man . he &apos;s got something .
yeah , i heard him . we all heard him .
he doesn &apos;t have anything .
he &apos;s got an address , that &apos;s all !
unless master yoda can send telepathic messages
that the rest of us cannot hear ...
actually , yoda technically
didn &apos;t have telepathic powers .
seriously ? right now ?
please . please listen to me .
is there any way that i can talk you out of this ?
has it ever worked before , danny ?
no .
okay , so let &apos;s go , yeah ?
okay .
wait @-@ wait @-@ wait .
you guys can &apos;t take your car . hpd &apos;s gonna be on
the look out for it .
then perhaps i can help .
yes , you are . yes , you ...
100 % , you are a monkey
in a polka dot dress .
and i love you and i &apos;m very happy that i will see you
in a couple days , okay ? that &apos;s right .
danno loves you .
all right , babe . all right .
you know , i could be wrong , it &apos;s rare ,
but you don &apos;t look happy .
well , i am happy on the inside .
you &apos;re a bad liar .
what are you doing ?
get down . you &apos;re supposed to be
the invisible man . would you get down ?
why are you changing the subject ?
i &apos;m not changing the subject .
you are changing the subject , danny . what &apos;s going on ?
put your head down !
rael is moving back to hawaii , okay ?
you told me she was staying in jersey .
why she moving back to hawaii ?
she &apos;s , uh ,
she &apos;s moving back in with stan .
oh , man .
the baby &apos;s his ?
turns out she &apos;s further along than she thought .
and so she &apos;s gonna try
to make it work with stan for the , for the kid &apos;s sake .
would you get down , please ? would you please get down ?
i &apos;m sorry , danny .
i &apos;m fine .
it didn &apos;t work out the first time ,
so who &apos;s to this time would be any different , right ?
please don &apos;t look at me like that .
i said i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m asking you not to give me that look , okay ?
i &apos;m more worried about my car , okay ?
okay , i &apos;ll take it from here .
actually , i &apos;m enjoying myself very much .
i may even cash in
my prehistoric fossil collection
to put a down payment on one of these bad boys .
come on .
also , if i don &apos;t drive , i get carsick .
just don &apos;t get pulled over .
hey , what ya got ?
hey , i got your lapdog .
but so far , no sign of wo fat .
wait . who &apos;s this haole ?
he doesn &apos;t look like one of wo fat &apos;s crew .
he could be part of the deal wo fat &apos;s trying to pull off .
all right , i &apos;ll get a picture
and run it through facial recognition .
call me when you get a hit .
recognize this ?
yeah , it was in my father &apos;s toolbox .
it belonged to a man named hideki mokoto ,
former japanese pilot .
he earned that medal for bombing pearl harbor .
he gave it to your father .
why ?
he wants to tell you that himself .
wait a minute , this guy &apos;s still alive ?
through that door .
you have his eyes .
let me just get this straight .
after pearl harbor , this guy strikes it rich ,
very rich , obviously , and he decides
to move here and dedicate his life to cleaning up this island ?
he called it a personal atonement .
and how does mcgarrett &apos;s father come into play ?
they met at a memorial service for the arizona
where steve &apos;s grandfather died . and it was there
that mokoto approached john and asked for his forgiveness .
ultimately the two of them became friends .
a couple years later mokoto hired him .
he &apos;d gotten upset
over corruption in the police department
and local politics .
so he asked john
to secretly conduct an investigation .
okay , and that &apos;s when john finds out
that the governor &apos;s in bed with wo fat .
yeah .
and before he died , john told mokoto
that he had the evidence
that would prove it .
what evidence ?
mokoto didn &apos;t know .
all john said was that he hid it on molokai .
why didn &apos;t he tell me ?
everything your father did
was to protect his family .
gotcha .
we found this in her car .
tell me , ms. kalakaua ,
what are you doing here ?
it can &apos;t be official business , you &apos;re suspended .
so you know who i am .
is that supposed to intimidate me ?
no .
that &apos;s their job .
i &apos;m just a businessman .
so what are you selling to kurt hauff ?
the japanese have a saying :
iwanu ga hana .
&quot; not speaking is the flower . &quot;
good day , ms. kalakaua .
here you go .
mahalo .
hi . i was wondering if i could use your bathroom ?
of course .
you &apos;re going to have to buy
a shave ice first .
come on , kamekona , seriously ?
let me give you a tip .
the key to undercover work-- you got to make it look real .
i &apos;ll have a cherry .
with ice cream or adzuki beans ?
i don &apos;t care . you choose .
beans definitely .
hey , hungry ?
it &apos;s part of my cover .
i think i have something .
it &apos;s the locker key
from your father &apos;s toolbox .
based on mokoto &apos;s intel ,
i traced it to the airport on molokai .
that &apos;s where your father hid the evidence .
looks like someone set up a hidden camera .
wait , wait , wait .
that &apos;s the governor &apos;s study .
yeah , looks like it .
who &apos;s this guy ?
that &apos;s my father .
this camera-- what if it &apos;s still there ?
if that &apos;s the case ,
then the governor &apos;s murder
may have been captured on video , right ?
this is detective chang .
i think i may have found our fugitive .
we &apos;d better be right about this ,
or we &apos;re going to be sharing a cell with mcgarrett .
i call top bunk .
looks like the camera was pointed in this direction .
yeah , this is it . this is the angle right here .
okay , come on .
chin .
that could be a lens right there .
you didn &apos;t happen to bring your screwdriver , did you ?
screw ... ? i left it at home with my hammer .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
this is the governor &apos;s residence .
who are you and what are you doing here ?
lieutenant governor denning ,
uh , i &apos;m lieutenant chin ho kelly .
this is detective danny williams .
we &apos;re very sorry to intrude like this .
wait a minute-- williams ... kelly ?
from five @-@ o ?
i thought that was dismantled .
yes , sir , it was . but we have reason to believe
that there &apos;s a key piece of evidence here that has to do
with the governor &apos;s murder .
what kind of evidence ?
your big friend out there is quite the entrepreneur .
he &apos;s telling me all about his plans to open a shrimp truck .
he asked me if i wanted
to get in on the ground floor .
kamekona &apos;s good people .
you got a lot of good people around you .
you put together a nice team .
are you okay , son ?
you &apos;ve been awful quiet
ever since we left mokoto &apos;s .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
i was only 15 years old when my father sent me away .
he did that to protect you .
i know , i know .
but then i joined the service .
all right , i got deployed .
i didn &apos;t get a lot of time to spend with him as an adult .
and now i &apos;m realizing there &apos;s all this stuff
about him that i never knew .
he had all these secrets , and it bugs me .
well , when this is over ,
maybe we can shed some light on those secrets .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t .
why ?
wo fat warned me not to dig into my family &apos;s past .
he said i might not like what i find .
what did he mean by that ?
listen , son , you may not have known your father ,
but he knew you .
when you were training at coronado ,
he called to check in with me every week to see how you were doing .
and as for when you were younger ,
well , trust me , that was as hard on him as it was on you .
in the 34 years i knew your father ,
i saw him cry twice .
at your mother &apos;s funeral ,
and the day he sent you away .
he was a good man .
and there &apos;s no reason to think otherwise .
we got company .
mcgarrett , we have the building surrounded .
come out with your hands up .
what are you going to do ?
yeah , brah , just give us the word .
down . down ! on your knees now !
get down , mcgarrett !
lock him up .
i want those two arrested for harboring a fugitive .
listen to me-- they have nothing to do with this , okay ?
i forced them to help , you understand ?
they have nothing to do with this .
let him go .
you heard the man , get the cuffs off him .
what the hell is this about ?
just relax , okay ?
you have the wrong man , detective .
mcgarrett &apos;s innocent .
he didn &apos;t kill the governor .
i am not the enemy , steve .
i have always been loyal to the people
who are loyal to me .
is that why you had laura hills murdered ?
because she was disloyal ?
yes .
what are we going to do ? we have to get rid of him .
i have everything under control .
you can &apos;t even see it &apos;s him .
you can &apos;t even see it &apos;s wo fat .
no , but what we do clearly see ,
is that you didn &apos;t kill the governor .
commander mcgarrett , you have my sincerest apologies
for everything you &apos;ve been through .
all due respect , sir , i don &apos;t need your apologies .
what i need you to do
is reinstate my five @-@ o task force
so we can go after this son of a bitch right here .
well , there is no doubt that five @-@ o had an impact on crime ,
so as lieutenant governor , i &apos;ll grant your request .
all right . thank you , sir .
but there are conditions .
what conditions ?
governor jameson gave you full immunity and means
to basically run roughshod over ever single law on the state &apos;s books .
that &apos;s not going to happen on my watch .
you cross the line , you answer to me .
understood , sir .
but just so we &apos;re clear ,
sometimes we get put in positions where lives are on the line
and we have to make split @-@ second decisions ,
and when that happens ,
the line you &apos;re talking about gets a little hard to see .
fair enough .
i &apos;ll reinstate detective williams
and lieutenant kelly immediately .
don &apos;t forget about officer kalakaua .
she needs to be cleared of all the charges pending against her as well .
i &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible .
i &apos;m told officer kalakaua is still being investigated
by internal affairs .
they &apos;ll need to complete that investigation
to determine whether or not she &apos;s fit for duty .
let &apos;s go .
where is , uh , kono anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . she was supposed to check in an hour ago .
you won &apos;t shoot . you &apos;re a cop .
you see a badge ?
lieutenant kelly .
chin , you have to get
to ko &apos;olina marina , pier 49 .
that &apos;s where wo fat is .
the deal &apos;s going down now .
once it &apos;s done , he &apos;s going to disappear .
that &apos;s it !
we &apos;re too late .
i got the buyer .
i &apos;ll cover her . you guys go after the boat .
i &apos;m joe .
kono .
nice shooting , kono .
i wouldn &apos;t touch that .
call homeland security .
tell them to get their people out here .
looks like we got the raw materials for a dirty bomb .
chin , take the wheel !
get us close , okay ?
danny , you ready ?
no .
good . come on .
wo fat &apos;s not here .
well , he can &apos;t be far away .
wo fat-- where is he ?
where &apos;s wo fat ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know !
book him , danno .
come on .
look , i told you ,
i don &apos;t know where wo fat is .
i don &apos;t believe you .
come on . come on . what are you scared of ?
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s why i asked .
we were supposed to take his money to the big island ,
meet him there .
that &apos;s all i know .
you know what ?
i believe him .
i understand .
oh , you do ?
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
you heard the man .
he doesn &apos;t know anything .
off you go . you &apos;re free to go .
go .
go . go , go , go .
that &apos;s good . he &apos;s a ... a dead person now .
if you want to catch a shark , you got to chum the waters .
oh , that ... that &apos;s the bait ?
uh , yeah , he &apos;s the bait .
what are you looking at me like that for ?
you got a better idea ?
didn &apos;t think so .
five @-@ o back in business .
for some of us .
hey , you can &apos;t sweat this , coz , all right ?
my guess is you &apos;re back on duty inside a couple of weeks .
yeah , and in the meantime , there &apos;s no law
that says you can &apos;t grab a beer with friends , right ?
yeah . i mean ...
i mean , i kind of do enjoy not going to work .
get to surf every day for as long as i want .
i haven &apos;t been on a board in 25 years .
well , why don &apos;t you come out with me ?
i mean , i got the boards and plenty of free time .
you know what ? don &apos;t get too used to all that free time , all right ?
we may need somebody in an unofficial advisory capacity
or maybe for a little undercover work here and there .
i didn &apos;t hear that .
if you &apos;re looking for work ,
i could use a pretty hostess at my new shrimp truck .
really ?
i &apos;m allergic to shrimp .
you got to try my shrimp @-@ flavored tofu .
that sounds disgusting .
you just lost a job .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me .
thank your old man .
if it wasn &apos;t for his investigation ,
you &apos;d still be in jail right now .
heard about rachel .
is he going to be okay ?
you &apos;re already behind , partner .
drink up . what are you doing ?
um , i was going through the rest of the surveillance footage ,
and i ... i found this .
this is a meeting
between wo fat and governor jameson ...
and your old man .
uh , audio &apos;s all been erased .
that &apos;s all we got .
maybe ... maybe wo fat was right .
maybe my father was dirty .
well , we don &apos;t know what this is , okay ?
this could have been part of your father &apos;s investigation .
everything all right ?
no .
we need to talk to victor hesse .
whatever deal wo fat is making with my father ,
