this is an easy one .
you love this guy .
me .
come on . he &apos;s an underappreciated genius .
still think it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s not you .
now think , there &apos;s a car named after him .
of course there is .
the mini cooper &apos; cause it &apos;s me .
how about this :
he &apos;s a poor man &apos;s sheldon cooper .
oh , tesla .
how &apos;d it go ?
oh , not fun .
the doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses .
yeah , i watched .
it was like the scary boat tunnel in willy wonka .
did they figure out what &apos;s wrong ?
yeah .
it &apos;s a deviated septum .
the surgery to correct it is simple .
he &apos;s gonna do it next week .
why would you have surgery ?
because i can &apos;t breathe .
i snore , i get sinus infections ...
yeah , back off , he &apos;s all mine .
but you don &apos;t have a life @-@ threatening condition .
why would you take the risk of surgery ?
sheldon , it &apos;s a routine procedure .
i &apos;ve heard you complain about his snoring .
we ... yes , for the first five or six years ,
but i &apos;ve gotten used to it .
it helps me sleep .
he &apos;s like my mucus @-@ powered white noise machine .
sheldon , i &apos;m gonna get the surgery , it &apos;s no big deal .
very well . i &apos;m done talking about it .
thank you .
i believe it was your turn in the game .
okay .
let &apos;s see ...
oh , this person is most famous
for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery
and never living the rest of his life in the shadows
as a hideous , disfigured freak .
i think you could give a better clue .
i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not even sure if that &apos;s a person or a typo .
okay , why ?
i &apos;m listening to you snore .
i &apos;m wondering how i &apos;ll ever sleep without it .
if it helps you sleep ,
then why are you sitting here staring at me
like the albino boogeyman ?
really , leonard-- insults ?
after i spent two hours in your closet ,
waiting for you to fall asleep ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
if the surgery is successful , the snoring is gone .
and if you die during surgery ...
... the snoring is gone .
it sounds like either way , i finally get some rest .
i have to be honest with you leonard ,
i &apos;m truly worried .
i @-@ i told you , there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
well , i &apos;ve been doing some research
and i &apos;ve learned that one in 700,000 people
die from general anesthesia .
buddy , w ... do you realize that that also means
699,999 people don &apos;t die ?
i suppose that &apos;s true .
you &apos;re such a glass half @-@ full kind of guy .
i &apos;m going to miss that .
oh , so , my , uh , parents &apos; 40th anniversary &apos;s coming up
and i can &apos;t think of a thing to get them .
damn , can you imagine
being married to someone for 40 years ?
not anymore .
anyway , any ideas on a gift ?
well , what are some of the things they like ?
they used to like going to the mumbai symphony ,
but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in .
then my dad said based on their love life ,
she should know about phoning it in .
he said that to her ?
well , they weren &apos;t speaking at the time ,
so he had a servant say it to her .
oh , maybe i could make a gift for them .
i know how much you guys love the coasters i made for you .
they &apos;re yours in the divorce .
hey . what &apos;re you working on ?
remember when i said if you went through with your surgery ,
there was a one @-@ in @-@ 700,000 chance of dying ?
yeah ... ?
well , i &apos;ve been crunching the numbers ,
and so far , i &apos;ve gotten your probability of death
all the way to a sphincter @-@ tightening one in 300 .
great timing .
my &quot; check sphincter &quot; light just went on .
leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction
to the surgeon &apos;s latex gloves ?
i &apos;m not allergic to latex .
well , then why don &apos;t you wear the rubber gloves
i bought for you to do the dishes ?
for the same reason i don &apos;t wear the apron or the hair net .
fine . what about epilepsy ?
i don &apos;t have epilepsy , either .
you don &apos;t , but the surgeon might , hmm ?
and your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away
from becoming the dancing fountain at disneyland .
sheldon , do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery ?
i do . i have the drive to the hospital right here .
that is if you make it to the car
without falling down the stairs .
and don &apos;t expect me to carry you , i do that enough in life .
buddy , i @-@ i get that you &apos;re worried about me
and i @-@ i appreciate that , but i &apos;m not going to die .
you don &apos;t know that .
i do know that it won &apos;t be from an asteroid strike .
you know who else said that ?
every cocky t. rex currently
swimming around in the gas tank of your car .
i @-@ if there was an asteroid strike ,
wouldn &apos;t you die , too ?
i don &apos;t know-- i &apos;m smart and scrappy ,
i think i &apos;d find a way .
tell you what-- the surgery &apos;s not for a week ,
i &apos;ll think about it .
thank you .
and while you &apos;re thinking about it ,
if you have the surgery in nicaragua during monsoon season ,
i can practically guarantee your death .
yes . okay .
i @-@ i understand .
of course , yes .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
bye .
so i found this fencing school in burbank
that has a jedi class .
and if you &apos;re cool being the only adults there ,
they said they are .
dude , my parents just split up .
what ? !
uh , that was my dad on the phone .
he moved out .
oh , my god , i ... i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , if you &apos;re not up to it , we don &apos;t have to go out ,
we can just hang here .
no , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
as long as they &apos;re happy , i &apos;m happy .
and when i get to see them for the holidays ,
i &apos;ll get to celebrate diwali twice--
one at each house .
that &apos;s double the diwali .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
i &apos;m okay .
you don &apos;t look okay .
how can i be okay ? i come from a broken home .
the doctor said i should be out of surgery by 10 : 00 .
okay .
and sheldon really believes
we &apos;re at a public swimming pool ?
he was so busy figuring out
how many parts per million of urine we &apos;d be floating around in ,
he didn &apos;t even question it .
18 parts per million .
and he &apos;s still doing it .
don &apos;t worry about that . i &apos;m happy to take you to work .
well , thank you .
and leonard never lets me have french toast sticks in the car .
i can &apos;t have syrupy fingers ,
but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl .
it &apos;s nice they &apos;re getting exercise .
although now that i think about it ,
leonard would never go swimming in public
without his swim shirt .
i &apos;m sure he brought it .
no , but last year , at magic mountain ,
he got such a bad sunburn ,
we had to cut him out of it .
he probably got a new one . finish your breakfast .
look , there &apos;s an entire section of my dashboard
that doesn &apos;t have any syrup on it .
you &apos;re acting odd . why ?
i &apos;m odd all the time , everyone knows that .
just last night , i tried to see how many fava beans
i could fit in my mouth .
tell me the truth .
28 .
come on .
fifty @-@ six .
amy !
what &apos;s going on ?
all right .
don &apos;t get upset , but ...
an earlier appointment opened up for leonard
and he &apos;s getting the surgery right now .
i see .
take me to leonard .
just go to work , he &apos;ll be fine .
amy , he &apos;s my best friend ,
and if you don &apos;t take me , i &apos;m going there anyway .
fine .
it &apos;s sweet that you care about him so much .
i do .
and i wouldn &apos;t be able to forgive myself ,
if something happened to him
and i wasn &apos;t at his bedside to say , &quot; i told you so . &quot;
hello .
we had a really nice swim .
oh , stop it .
i assume this medical center &apos;s already treated
the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire .
&quot; 骗子骗子 裤子着火 &quot;
&apos;cause i &apos;m a liar , liar ?
that &apos;s for the fire marshal to determine .
you had to tell him ?
he wore me down .
and i was distracted .
he has on extra baby powder today .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
very well .
he &apos;s gonna be all right .
that is sticky .
come on , let &apos;s talk about something other than the surgery .
that &apos;s a good idea .
penny , did you and leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements ?
i think she meant something a little happier .
i suppose we could try to make it a celebration ,
but he died so young .
knock , knock . hi .
hey .
what brings you by ?
muffin much .
told you-- not funny .
he &apos;s just not laughing
because he &apos;s feeling ... blue berry .
tough crowd .
i &apos;m sorry . this is very sweet . thanks .
so , how you doing ?
better . i guess the news just
hit me a lot harder than i expected .
well , of course .
i would be devastated if my parents split up .
why ? your father barely speaks to your mother .
well , at least he stuck around ,
not like your dad , who just took off .
as you can see , we &apos;re here to cheer you up .
sorry , raj .
do you have any sense of what happened with your folks ?
i think , over time , they started to resent each other ,
and instead of talking about the things that bothered them ,
they kept it bottled up ,
and the hate just grew .
it &apos;s a shame they spent all that time unhappy .
but sometimes ,
there &apos;s muffin you can do about it .
you get it , right ?
oh , it &apos;s nice you got him that .
oh , this isn &apos;t for leonard , no .
amy bought it for me .
stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in .
you know those confounded things make me dizzy .
who told you to keep going around ?
there was a large plant in the lobby .
it kept looking like the outside .
okay , listen , when leonard comes out ,
he is not gonna feel great ,
so , please don &apos;t give him a hard time .
penny has a good point .
this is like the man in the supermarket
with the goiter on his neck .
whatever you &apos;re thinking , just keep it to yourself .
it was like a grapefruit .
and i &apos;m sure he knew that
before you held a grapefruit up next to it .
well , i &apos;m not making any promises .
not only did leonard take what i feel is an unnecessary risk ,
he deceived me .
okay , the reason he deceived you is
you were being a pain in the ass .
the reason i was being a pain in the b is
because i was worried about him , and no one else was .
really ? you won &apos;t even say &quot; a &quot; ?
you bet your sweet b i won &apos;t .
obviously , i care about leonard .
i &apos;m gonna spend the rest of my life with him .
and i &apos;m not ?
it &apos;s an earthquake .
i knew it .
sheldon , it was just a little tremor .
a little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery
into a frontal lobotomy .
oh , i don &apos;t care for this at all .
oh , i need to see he &apos;s okay .
sheldon , you can &apos;t go back there .
try and stop me !
are you okay ?
why didn &apos;t you stop me ? !
can i tell you something ?
this whole thing with raj &apos;s parents
just got me a little worried about us .
what are you talking about ? we &apos;re fine .
and raj &apos;s parents probably split up because of raj .
what ? !
they always say the children aren &apos;t to blame , but ...
come on .
i &apos;m not joking , howie .
you heard what he said about his parents .
it was the little things they kept bottled up .
i don &apos;t want that to happen to us .
how can i convince you it won &apos;t ?
well , is there anything about me you &apos;re keeping inside ?
i &apos;m not answering that .
it &apos;s a trap .
so there are things you don &apos;t like .
and here i am in the trap .
you just keep talking .
i &apos;m gonna chew my leg off .
just tell me one thing that bothers you ,
and i promise i won &apos;t get mad .
okay . the truth is ...
sometimes ... you &apos;re too ...
beautiful .
howie , be serious .
okay , okay .
i really don &apos;t like
how your wings poke me when we sleep
&apos;cause you &apos;re an angel .
okay , fine , maybe it was a bad idea .
i just don &apos;t think the secret to a happy marriage
is going out of our way to criticize each other .
although , there are ways to improve our communication .
one thing i learned when i was in couples therapy was ...
who were you in couples therapy with ?
not important .
was it your mom ?
not important .
it was your mom .
anyway , the therapist had us tell each other
what we loved about one another .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet !
i want to do that .
all right .
okay , um ...
i love that you make me laugh .
thank you .
and i love that you &apos;re strong and independent .
and yet , i still love when you hold a door for me .
i love that i &apos;m kind of a slob around here , and ...
you &apos;re okay with that .
uh @-@ huh .
and i love that i work and do all the cleaning ,
and you &apos;re okay with that .
see , i am .
isn &apos;t this great ?
come on , smile .
this is gonna be my christmas card .
you know this is all your fault .
how is it my fault ?
i told you not to get the surgery .
okay , first of all , the surgery was a success ,
and secondly , i didn &apos;t even want you there .
i don &apos;t know which hurts worse--
my nose or my heart .
well , i &apos;m done speaking to you .
don &apos;t be like that .
you two need to talk this out .
yeah , &apos; cause you sound really funny .
sheldon , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you about the surgery ,
but you were worried about nothing .
oh , you &apos;re hardly out of the woods , no .
you still run the risk of infection , a blood clot ,
the possibility that an inattentive surgeon
let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose .
the minute you sneeze web , i &apos;m moving out .
i never thought i &apos;d say these words ,
but come on , nose spider !
who are you kidding ?
you were so panicked leonard was gonna die ,
you &apos;ll never leave him .
sheldon will move out eventually .
yeah , once he figures out how to work a door .
i was not panicked , and i am not overly attached to leonard .
you were so worried that you smashed your face
trying to check on me .
you love me .
yeah . tell me those aren &apos;t the words of a man
with a spider eating its way through his brain .
amy , you &apos;re a neuroscientist .
crack his skull open , spray some raid in there .
i love that you take pride in your looks ,
even when i have to pee in the morning ,
and you &apos;re in there spending an hour on your hair .
i love that you &apos;re too good to pee in the kitchen sink .
i love that you have the confidence to speak ,
even without giving it an ounce of thought .
and i love how your hair is always on the soap .
it &apos;s like washing myself with a hamster .
hey , guys . sorry i am so late .
i was on the phone with my mother .
oh , how is she ?
pretty good .
she bought the book eat , pray , love
and used it to set my father &apos;s mercedes on fire .
so , what &apos;s up with you guys ?
we &apos;re just saying all the things we love about each other .
oh , like you and i did at couples therapy .
ooh , what &apos;d you get ?
oh , i ordered it before your surgery .
it &apos;s the urn i was going to put you in .
okay , that &apos;s morbid .
send it back .
i can &apos;t send it back-- i had it engraved .
&quot; here lie the ashes of leonard hofstadter .
he thought he was right , but his roommate knew better . &quot;
that &apos;s funny .
boy , i &apos;m gonna miss these painkillers .
hey , why did you get two ?
&quot; i &apos;m with stupid . &quot;
oh , that one &apos;s mine .
