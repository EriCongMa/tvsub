it &apos;s henry . leave a message .
henry ...
it &apos;s bethany . look , i know this is gonna sound crazy ,
but i think someone &apos;s following me .
just in case , i &apos;m going to e @-@ mail you a file .
call me as soon as you get this .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything sexier
than a man who can steal me away from work ,
and can cook .
try it .
oh , hold on . you got a little something .
what ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m fixing a mistake .
this should have been on your finger a long time ago .
chin ho kelly ,
i would like nothing more than to be your wife .
mmm ... are you going to get that ?
get what ?
kelly .
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
victim &apos;s name is bethany morris .
she was a reporter for the pacific register .
what happened ?
based on the abraded injuries and splinters in her hands ,
it would seem that the victim was hiding
before she was dragged out from under her bed .
so that &apos;s when her neck was broken .
correct . it &apos;s very sad .
yes . besides that , we have no prints ,
no signs of forced entry .
perp was in and out , very clean , very quick .
so i just got off the phone
with a henry dobson , bethany &apos;s editor .
she left him a voice mail just after midnight last night .
well , based on rigor ,
that is within my estimated tod .
did he say what the message was ?
yeah . bethany told henry she was being followed ,
and she was going to e @-@ mail him a file . he never got it .
okay , we got a monitor , keyboard , cables ...
no computer tower .
the killer could &apos;ve taken it .
i wonder what she was working on .
i don &apos;t know what file
bethany was talking about when she left the message ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure
it had something to do with athis logistics .
who are they ?
one of the largest shipping companies on o &apos;ahu .
bethany blew the whistle on them last month
for dumping benzene waste
in the ocean just two miles off @-@ shore .
they couldn &apos;t have been happy when that story came out .
the day it hit , company stock took a dive .
lost $ 200 million in a day .
she started getting death threats .
eight in the last three weeks .
any of them sound legitimate ?
the head of my security did forward me this voice mail
from her office phone a couple of days ago .
keep away from athis .
you publish one more thing , you &apos;re a dead woman .
sounds legit to me .
keep away from athis .
you publish one more thing , you &apos;re a dead woman .
it &apos;s a good soundalike , i &apos;ll give you that .
but it &apos;s not me .
voice comparison says it is .
well , mr. schulte , i &apos;d take
the word of a voice comparison over you .
did someone at athis tell you to kill bethany morris ,
or did you just make that call on the fly ?
was i paid to dig up some dirt on the reporter ?
maybe scare her a little ?
sure , i &apos;ll cop to that .
but i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
are you ... i mean , how big of a moron are you ?
a woman turns up dead
after you leave her a series of death threats .
do you think that a jury &apos;s just going to ignore that ?
what if i had something
that could help you find who did this ?
we &apos;re listening .
the other day , i followed morris to maui .
she spent a couple of hours there , and then flew back .
well , what was she doing there ?
i don &apos;t know .
she went to a small place up around kapalua .
didn &apos;t see who she met , but the person &apos;s mail
was addressed to a jane woodley .
couldn &apos;t find anything on her .
that &apos;s interesting . it &apos;s not quite enough
for a get out of jail free card , but ...
i &apos;m getting to it .
that night , i flew back .
went to morris &apos;s place in chinatown
and sat on it .
all right , when was that ?
last night .
night morris was murdered .
i saw a guy go in there five minutes before she did .
i thought he lived in the building ,
but then , 15 minutes later ,
i see the guy chugging down the fire escape
with something under his arm .
computer tower ?
could &apos;ve been .
what did he look like ?
i don &apos;t know .
i tried taking a picture , but it was dark .
did manage to get a partial plate before he took off .
what do you think ?
well , let &apos;s run the plates on the car .
have lori do it ,
and , uh , how do you feel about going to maui ?
let &apos;s do it .
good to see you back on the island , jenna .
your e @-@ mail said it was important .
what &apos;s up ?
i have a favor to ask you .
it &apos;s really big .
is this about your fiance ?
ever since i heard that josh might be alive
in southeast asia , i have been ...
pounding the pavement back in d.c.
after three months of analyzing classified intel
and trading favors ...
i found him .
josh is alive .
are you kidding me ?
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s great news , jenna .
that &apos;s incredible . do you know where he is ?
north korea .
a small rebel faction is holding josh hostage near the border .
they got a hold of him after a cia op went bad .
the one i messed up .
okay . have you , um ... have you taken this to the agency ?
yeah .
they can &apos;t lift a finger . they have to disavow
any and all knowledge of his existence .
s.o.p. for this kind of job , behind enemy lines , covert op .
what do these rebels want ?
they are willing to exchange josh
for $ 250,000 , u.s. currency .
that &apos;s where i come in .
what , you can ... you &apos;re thinking ... wait a minute .
you &apos;re seriously considering going through with this ?
if i don &apos;t , josh is dead .
jenna ...
do you understand ?
i have no other options but to pay them .
well ...
okay , have you got that kind of money ?
i sold my parents &apos; house in virginia to get it .
it &apos;s all i have .
where &apos;s this deal going down ?
their turf .
a small town about 20 miles south of kaesong .
i can &apos;t go alone , steve .
i need somebody there to watch my back .
i need you .
yeah . yes , sir .
no , absolutely . no , no , no .
thank you , sir .
what &apos;s up ? any luck ?
no .
the ranger unit that supported me in capturing
anton hesse in north korea has been redeployed .
there &apos;s no way they can escort jenna to the drop site .
okay , listen . i know you ... i know you want
to put on the cape , and you want to go
save the day , but please keep in mind , please , that this is not
a puddle @-@ jumper to lana &apos;i .
okay ? this is north korea .
i &apos;m aware of that , thank you , danny .
okay .
what do you want to do ?
what am i gonna do ?
i got to help her .
i &apos;d do the same for you , and anybody else here .
you know ? what am i gonna do ?
okay , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . please , just ...
i &apos;m just assuming , whatever it is you &apos;re about to do ,
you &apos;ve done before , right ?
ah , it &apos;s classified .
of course .
do i ... is that concern that i see ?
yeah , jerk . i &apos;m concerned . big deal .
i &apos;ll be fine , all right ?
it &apos;s north korea . what could go wrong ?
yeah , i know . hey .
hi .
do me a favor and watch yourself , huh ?
i &apos;ll think about you the whole time .
thanks .
hmm . what did i miss ?
nothing .
he &apos;s , uh , got to go help a friend .
he &apos;ll be gone a couple days . what &apos;s up ?
you don &apos;t seem too happy about it .
is it something dangerous ?
no .
guy &apos;s a navy seal , right ?
everything &apos;s fine . nothing to worry about .
according to our suspect , your tenant , jane woodley ,
had a visitor a couple days ago .
was this the woman ?
yeah , that &apos;s her .
jane wasn &apos;t too happy about it , either .
kimo , we need to find jane .
did she leave any forwarding information ?
maybe a credit card to hold the place ?
i copied down her driver &apos;s license for the file .
here it is .
that &apos;s jenna kaye .
and this woman was here for how long ?
three months at least .
could you excuse us one minute ?
okay , what the hell ?
wasn &apos;t jenna supposed to be in d.c. these last three months ?
yeah , mcgarrett said that she was trying to find her fiancé .
apparently , she &apos;s not trying very hard .
well , if she lied to mcgarrett about that ,
then what else is she lying about ?
listen to me , jenna .
we don &apos;t give these guys any money until we get
a positive i.d. on josh , okay ?
josh .
no , just wait . just wait .
no guns .
bring money .
you bring guns , we shoot .
damn it , listen to me .
listen to me . that is not your fiance .
that man is 5 &apos; 9 . &quot;
he &apos;s got tan skin .
he &apos;s a healthy 185 pounds .
okay ? it &apos;s not josh .
let me go , steve .
not going to let you go .
we got to move . we got to go the other way right now .
i &apos;m sorry .
how long &apos;s she been working for you ?
hmm ?
that story she sold me about her fiancé-- is it true ?
huh ?
i just tried steve &apos;s satellite phone
20 times in the last hour .
no answer .
the area they &apos;re in is all deep forest .
it may have blocked the signal .
no , something is wrong . something is wrong .
otherwise , why would jenna lie to us ?
my question is , did jenna have anything to do
with bethany morris &apos;s murder ?
any word from steve ?
no , nothing .
okay , look , there &apos;s got to be a number
of logical explanations as to why he &apos;s not answering .
there &apos;s nothing logical about this . okay ?
we just found out that someone
we worked with-- someone that we trusted--
has been lying to us for months
and now might have something to do with our murder .
the only way we &apos;re going to get answers
to any of this is by finding bethany morris &apos;s killer .
lori , did you get anything on the suspect
schulte said he saw scrambling out of bethany &apos;s place ?
yeah , i got a hit off his partial plate .
it was a rental booked under the name sung paek .
dl &apos;s a fake , so i ran the name
against hotel registries across the island-- i got a match .
kailua inn .
gun !
took himself out rather than get caught . why ?
desperation ? fear ?
fear of what ? prison ?
what might happen to him if he talked to us .
guys , i think i got bethany morris &apos;s computer .
looks like our guy was trying to hack into it .
what the hell is that thing ?
it &apos;s a hard drive recovery system .
it &apos;s used for extracting encrypted data .
it &apos;s a virus .
uh , paek must have initiated it right before we breached .
can you stop it ?
no .
there might be a way to recover what &apos;s left , though .
you think you salvaged anything ?
yeah . i managed to recover a bunch of scattered data ,
including a couple pages from bethany morris &apos;s latest article ,
something called &quot; lost prisoner of fate . &quot;
what &apos;s it about ?
well , from what i could make out ,
it &apos;s , uh , about something called operation switchback .
that sounds like a military op .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought . look at this .
it &apos;s part of an e @-@ mail about a classified cia file
that looks like it &apos;s been 95 % redacted .
jenna was cia .
maybe that &apos;s why bethany went to see her .
i checked in with langley--
they have no official record of an op with that name .
no , they &apos;re lying .
of course they &apos;re lying ,
but the interesting thing was ,
when i asked them about it ,
they transferred me to a number in north carolina .
jsoc headquarters .
which means switchback was a joint
cia @-@ special forces operation ,
so no way we &apos;re going to get intel on that .
want to bet ?
you do realize those are one @-@ by @-@ twos , right , wade ?
i can measure . yeah .
those are for supporting the windows , not for cross bracing .
are you implying i don &apos;t know how to build a boar blind ?
no , i &apos;m not implying it ; i &apos;m saying it .
hey , joe !
would it kill you to stay in cell phone range ?
hey , what are you doing out here ?
listen , joe , i need to know
everything about a cia @-@ special forces joint operation
called switchback .
even if it rang a bell , i couldn &apos;t disclose anything about it .
what &apos;s so important about this op ?
i have no idea , but a woman was murdered over it ,
and someone we used to work with
might be involved now-- jenna kaye .
well , why don &apos;t you ask her about it ?
yeah , i would , but , uh , i can &apos;t
because she &apos;s with steve in north korea .
what ?
i think he &apos;s in trouble , joe .
i did what you asked .
now i want what was promised .
i want to see josh now .
josh ?
hey , it &apos;s jenna .
get a trace up right now .
hey . jenna , it &apos;s danny . where are you ?
danny ... i &apos;m sorry .
i screwed up .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . just tell me , where is steve ?
it &apos;s wo fat . it &apos;s wo fat , danny .
he has him , and i led steve right to him .
is he alive ?
we &apos;re south of kaesong-- a town called ...
town called what ? jenna , you broke up .
say it again .
no , jenna , i can &apos;t hear you .
where &apos;s steve ?
jenna , say it again .
jenna .
jenna !
jenna !
the governor has to do something .
i don &apos;t know . steve went into north korea
on a completely unsanctioned personal mission .
he thought he was helping a friend .
some friend .
any word ?
no , we &apos;re still waiting
to hear if danny can get the governor to help us .
you make any headway with the military ?
not in terms of rescuing steve ,
but i did get some interesting intel about operation switchback
that could help us .
what &apos;d you find out ?
it was a cia op
into north korea that went bad ,
resulted in the capture of one officer joshua hirsch .
that was kaye &apos;s fiance .
she took a leave from five @-@ o
thinking he could be alive .
seems a reporter named bethany morris
was asking all about operation switchback ,
specifically about officer hirsch .
why ?
she claimed she had a source
in south korea that said he was alive .
and since jenna kaye was listed
as the intel officer for the op ...
bethany morris went to see her to ask her about it .
okay , so how does this help us ?
because the unredacted switchback file
details the location of a bunker just south of kaesong ,
and it &apos;s suspected to be a cache for wo fat .
okay , kaesong-- isn &apos;t that where
kaye said she was when they got cut off ?
yeah .
um , well , we can forget it ,
because even if the governor appealed to the state department
about launching a diplomatic mission ,
something like that could take weeks ,
maybe even months , to get approved .
we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
something needs to get done right now
or steve &apos;s as good as dead .
that &apos;s right .
so what do we do ?
we &apos;re going to bring steve home .
joe , what &apos;s with the medical supplies ?
can &apos;t go on a humanitarian mission
to inoculate villagers in south korea
without the proper supplies .
humanitarian mission . right .
it was either that or say that we were a band
heading over there to entertain the troops .
so unless you play a mean bass ...
so what happens when we hit the ground in seoul ?
we &apos;re on our own .
i &apos;m going to need your badges and i.d. &apos; s .
the minute this plane leaves the ground ,
we &apos;re just civilians .
that means no military supplies , fire support
or friendlies in the area .
if the mission is compromised , we go on escape and evade .
and in the unlikely event that we pull this off ,
we could be charged with espionage ,
face federal prosecution
and prison time for what we are about to do .
that is , of course , if any of us make it back .
so if anyone wants to back out , now is the time .
no shame in it .
go with god and wish us luck .
all right , that settles it , then .
we come back with steve , or we don &apos;t come back .
all right , who &apos;s ready to kick ass and take names ?
got room for a few members of seal team 9
on this little , uh ... what are you calling it ?
humanitarian mission .
right . that &apos;s what i thought .
load it up , ladies .
okay , uh , i thought we weren &apos;t gonna have any military backup .
yeah , i mean , won &apos;t you guys get in serious trouble for this ?
well , technically , uh , team 9 had a few days
of r &amp; r coming , so we decided to do some sightseeing in seoul .
last i checked , we owe commander mcgarrett
and five @-@ o a favor .
about a little midair rescue , as i recall .
welcome aboard .
why ?
i had no choice .
we let you in .
we treated you as one of our own .
i trusted you .
i came down here , i didn &apos;t ask one question .
wo fat told me josh was alive .
you just took him for his word ?
he showed me his ring .
he had pictures .
but more than anything ,
i needed to believe it .
i would have done anything to save him .
so you decided to trade him for me .
yes .
so where is he , kaye ?
you have to understand ...
this reporter came to me looking into josh &apos;s operation .
she said she had a source
that said that josh was alive .
and i thought , if anyone could survive ...
he &apos;s a lot like you .
a fighter , you know ?
there was this one night ...
we were supposed to have dinner in d.c.
the capital grille .
it was raining , and he was late ,
and his car wouldn &apos;t start ,
so he hops on his bike of all things .
got in this horrible accident .
got hit by a car .
had to have these pins put in his knee .
and when i reached the hospital ,
i just lit into him .
he &apos;s always rushing around like that for nothing .
that &apos;s when he pulled out the ring and he said ,
&quot; it wasn &apos;t for nothing . &quot;
the reporter who came to you ...
was her name bethany morris ?
how did you know ?
she &apos;s dead .
she had her neck snapped . did you know that ?
no .
you don &apos;t get it , do you , kaye ?
wo fat was her source .
he sent ... he sent morris straight to you
to give you hope that josh was still alive .
and my hope got her killed .
all right , me and joe
have been studying the switchback op .
based on jsoc intel
and the latest thermal imaging
of the area where the team was taken ,
satellites have detected a flurry of recent activity
around this old korean war bunker .
activity in an area where there shouldn &apos;t be any activity ,
and border crossings where there shouldn &apos;t be border crossings .
all on foot , all in the last 24 hours .
you think it &apos;s wo fat &apos;s people ?
bet my life on it .
thing is , there &apos;s no roads in .
the quickest way to this compound &apos;s by helo .
anyone know where we can find one of those ?
yeah , along with a few automatic weapons ?
i know a guy .
what guy ?
as i live and drink .
funky joe white .
it &apos;s good to see you , frank .
hey , how are you , man ?
funky joe ?
yeah . played the sweetest guitar
this side of the sea of japan .
frank , this is danny williams ,
a friend of mine .
pleasure .
how you doing ?
drink ?
no , thank you . i &apos;m a ... i &apos;m more of a margarita guy myself .
can &apos;t argue with you there . sit down .
i would ask how you &apos;re doing , frank ,
but i see you haven &apos;t moved in 15 years .
hell , what brings you to this neck of the forest ?
business , unfortunately .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to collect on our debt .
come on . 14 years ?
got to be some kind of statute of limitations on that .
no . i &apos;m going to need tangerine
and a couple of extra party favors .
what for ?
i got a man in trouble ...
two towns over .
two towns over , as in over the border ?
yeah .
all right .
tangerine it is .
this is tangerine ?
don &apos;t knock it till you fly it .
we &apos;re going up in that thing ?
anyone else terrified right now ?
it can &apos;t be that bad , right ?
okay , now i &apos;m terrified .
you are kidding , right ?
you have a chicken nesting in your helicopter , sir .
relax , kid .
she &apos;s got what it takes .
i flew her out of saigon in &apos; 75 .
oh , you did ? have you flown her since ?
wade , why don &apos;t you run frank through the sat @-@ recon ,
see if he knows the area .
roger that .
kono , go set up for sat nav .
fasten your diapers .
let me ask you a question .
the guy can fly this thing sober or no ?
tell me about shelburne .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know
what the hell shelburne is , okay ?
your father spent a great deal of time
investigating the meaning of shelburne .
i can &apos;t imagine he didn &apos;t share any of his findings with you .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
what about joe white ?
what did he tell you ?
joe white ... joe white doesn &apos;t know
anything about shelburne , okay ?
you &apos;re lying .
what &apos;s so important about shelburne anyway ?
why do you care ?
you don &apos;t have any idea what shelburne is , do you ?
where did you find it ?
it wasn &apos;t for nothing .
i &apos;m gonna kill you !
you &apos;re a dead man ! you &apos;re a dead man !
we &apos;re getting on a plane in one hour ,
and you &apos;re taking me to shelburne .
get him up . we move now .
all right , listen up . this compound is basically
a bunker surrounded by tunnels .
frank &apos;s gonna insert us six clicks to the south .
we patrol in on foot from there .
frank will circle the lz
with agent weston and provide cover fire for the extraction .
you make contact with any opposition ,
eliminate the threat .
any questions ?
clear .
clear .
clear .
it &apos;s jenna .
still warm .
they couldn &apos;t have left that long ago .
come on .
we got to find steve .
blackbird , i have movement a mile north of you .
a convoy of trucks is heading west , towards the river .
copy that . will relay to red one .
we need to get eyes on that convoy .
one o &apos;clock .
they &apos;re headed to kaesong .
we got to hold them .
get the others and tell them to catch up .
red one , come in .
we &apos;ve got eyes on the convoy .
they &apos;re a mile northwest of your position ,
headed deeper in country .

we got to move .
there &apos;s a bridge up that road about a mile .
how &apos; bout we put that rpg to good use there ?
you ever fired one ?
no .
