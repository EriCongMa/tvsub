He won't find you -- Reddington --
if that's what you're hoping for or worried about.
Tom's alive. You don't have Agnes.
I'm not worried about anything.
I won't apologize for trying to restore my family.
Even if it means destroying mine.
Reddington -- He took you from me.
And you hate him for it,
for stealing your child.
I know how that feels.
You would've been with Agnes now if you hadn't tried to escape.
Yes.
But then again, so would you.
Tell me.
I got the girl.
Find a way across the Straits,
then contact my office in the Keys. Do it quickly.
Agnes has been away from her mother too long.
She's gonna kill us!
第四季 第二集
第66号
The child...
No.
Liz and Agnes.
No.
Please assist Mr. Kaplan.
You all right?
Where are they?
In danger. How did you find us?
I had Aram tracking that car.
I spent the better part of the day stuck in the trunk.
Who was the driver?
Had to be one of Kirk's hired hands.
6-foot, rough trade, dark skin.
Likes Western wear.
Mato. I saw his face.
Who's Mato?
A finder. A tracker. Killer when necessary.
How do we find him?
I don't know.
You don't know or you won't say?
We had a mutual friend.
He gave Mato his start as a skip tracer.
It was years ago.
Little Nikos.
I can talk to him.
If he knows anything, he'll tell me.
West Texas' favorite bail bondsman.
An Amarillo institution for 25 years to life.
Dembe, call Edward. Tell him to ready the jet.
We're gonna pay a visit to Little Nikos.
Excuse me. Sorry.
It's Mr. Reddington.
We have two targets --
Elizabeth Keen and Agnes Keen --
traveling separate paths to an unknown location.
Constantin Rostov, also know as Alexander Kirk,
fled with Elizabeth in a private seaplane
that departed from Playa Larga...
less than an hour ago, due west.
What about Agnes?
I have a lead on Agnes.
She was abducted by one of Kirk's private contractors,
a high-priced tracker known only as Mato.
He missed the flight off the island.
Then he's trapped in Cuba.
There's no way he'll make it past the PNR
after the international incident you just caused there.
Ordinarily I would agree with you, Agent Navabi,
but Mato isn't your garden-variety mercenary.
From what I'm told, he's an Indian --
part Sioux, part I don't know what,
son of a Shaman.
Mato could sneak up on a deer in a glade
and smack it on the rump.
He'll find his way off the island.
We'll notify the seaports just in case.
Good luck. And let us know what you turn up.
Contact Customs and Border Patrol.
They work with the Coast Guard
to monitor the air and waters around Cuba.
Sir, I don't understand why we're going to such extremes --
Agent Ressler is on a return flight from Cuba.
It's time to set aside your personal feelings
and help out this investigation.
This is my fault.
If anything happens to Elizabeth or the baby...
You have nothing to apologize for.
You tried to help us find a normal life.
I'd take that risk again.
I don't regret trying to get away from you.
Of course you don't.
Regret requires age or wisdom.
We were trying to protect Agnes.
I guess that didn't work out.
When we get to Amarillo,
I think it would be best to do as I say, both of you.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Plane down off the coast of Havana.
23 degrees,
52 minutes north.
82 degrees, 49 minutes south.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Can anyone hear me?
My sat phone.
Gone.
You need to untie me, Masha.
Mayday, mayday, mayday, is anyone there?
What was that?
You need to know that Agnes is safe.
She'll be cared for.
You see anything?
One of the pontoons is taking on water.
We don't have long.
Untie me!
Masha, I'm your father. You can't let me drown.
Watch me.
We've got every sonar operator in the Miami district
working on this.
We launched the search as soon as I received your call.
Any chance the plane is still in range?
A light aircraft, flying low and slow? We'll find it.
We monitor 2 million square miles of ocean from Miami.
Welcome back, Agent Ressler. This is Captain Daly.
He's our liaison with the U.S. Coast Guard.
I'm authorized to give you full access to our radar screens.
If that seaplane is flying low, won't it avoid detection?
Most radar transmitters are on the ground, aimed at the sky.
Ours float in the sky on balloons, looking down.
They're designed to detect small aircraft,
like the one you described.
If you don't mind me asking, who's on the plane?
Friend.
A fugitive.
Sounds complicated.
When we get inside, let me talk to him.
He and I have history.
He and I don't. I'll be more persuasive.
Is that what this has come to?
The chance for you to punish me by hurting someone I care about?
You are not my concern. Agnes is.
If someone you care about is hurt
in the process of finding her, so be it.
Do you remember what I looked like that night?
Lying in the street, my head torn open...
Annie's body in front of me.
You know I don't know what you looked like. I was away.
Right, but he does.
Little Nikos sat by my bed in the hospital.
When I healed, he gave me work, a reason to push on.
He's a decent man.
I'm only here to serve you today because of his kindness.
You may speak to him first.
Briefly.
Afternoon. Can I help you?
Little Nikos, please.
Oh, wish I could oblige, Miss...
Mr. Kaplan, an old friend.
Mr. Kaplan, I wish I could oblige,
but Nikos is takin' a little nap.
Perhaps it's time for a wake-up call.
Uh, I'm afraid that's not possible. He's in surgery.
Where?
His stomach.
And where might we find his stomach?
I told him he couldn't come in.
Oh, my. Me and my timing.
What the hell is going on?
Is this a lap band?
I knew all those desserts would catch up
with Little Nikos one day.
I think I see some baklava in there.
Put that down. Helen, get him out of here.
Call building security.
I need your capable team here to wake up your patient.
What? Call security right now.
Wake him up.
I can't. We're in the middle of a procedure.
I'd be putting his life in danger.
His life's already in danger. How 'bout yours?
There are no life vests, no inflatable rafts.
We're gonna flip.
Our only chance is out there, holding onto the pontoons.
You mean my only chance.
You're not going anywhere.
We're not gonna survive unless we trust each other.
I'll never trust you.
We're a family. Not Reddington. Us.
If you wanna hold your child in your arms again,
we need to trust each other.
The Coast Guard just picked up a brief ELT signal
from a light aircraft west of Havana,
somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.
An ELT signal? Are you telling me their plane went down?
It appears that way, sir.
But we have a location for them.
It's not that simple.
This ELT signal's an older model. Analog frequency.
No digital signal to carry GPS coordinates.
ELTs are notoriously unreliable, especially if they're...
submerged underwater.
We've narrowed the search field to 220 square miles.
SAR teams are gearing up now.
I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen,
but I don't know if I have the strength to lose her again.
None of us do.
Stay on it. Say a prayer.
And notify me the minute you have an update.
He's awake - and in excruciating pain.
I gave him a self-administering morphine drip
to manage his discomfort.
Even that won't be enough
unless you get what you want quickly and leave.
Remember...
we're getting what we need, one way or another.
Kate. What are you...
What's happening?
We only have a minute. Raymond Reddington is here.
He wants Mato.
Tell me how to find Mato.
No.
He'll kill you if you don't.
He'll kill Mato if I do.
I'm not gonna hurt you, Nikos.
You're a good man. Loyal.
Protective of those who are protective of you.
I admire that in a person.
Unfortunately for you, I'm surrounded by people who don't.
Tom, I'd like to introduce you to Little Nikos,
the man who's protecting the sociopath who stole your baby.
Good luck with that surgery, Nick.
Don't let go.
No matter what, don't let go.
They're looking.
The FBI, the Coast Guard.
They'll find us.
They'll find you... -
...which is enough.
No. No!
I told you not to let go.
I can help you.
It's too much.
You said we have to trust each other.
Do you trust me?
Yes.
Then hold on.
They will find us.
They will find us.
Here's my little girl.
That's Agnes.
I'm gonna put this right...
here,
because she is the reason I am doing this. Remember that.
I'll just take this.
That's enough, yeah.
Tell me how to find Mato.
I...I can't do that.
Well, you do have guts.
What do you think this does?
I'm sorry it had to be Nikos.
If there's no sincerity behind your words,
don't waste them.
What would you have me say, Kate?
Say that you understand.
I didn't just give you my friend as an act of contrition.
I'm not sorry for what I did.
I betrayed you for the same reason I just betrayed Nikos --
to keep Elizabeth safe,
Just like you asked me to all those years ago,
when you first put her in my arms as a baby girl,
only now she has a baby girl of her own,
and your existence in their lives
puts them in constant danger.
Say that you understand or don't say anything at all.
Hey, stay awake.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
Tell me, uh, about your parents.
What were their names?
Help!
Over here! Help!
I got a phone number and a password.
Nakaidoklini?
It's a famous medicine man. I don't know.
You text that name to that number using Nikos' cellphone,
and Mato will show up in person at the bail office.
It's how they do it.
I'm so sorry, Nikos.
Kate.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Uh, he needs medical attention.
First aid?
Uh, do you understand?
Medicina.
Medicina? Si.
Good, good. Show me.
He needs it right now. Right now.
Why did you save me?
Why?
Because you know where Agnes is.
Is that the only reason?
You need to keep pressure on that leg.
You've lost a lot of blood.
I saved you because of Agnes,
but...
also maybe because you might be telling the truth.
Me llamo Elizabeth Keen. I'm with the FBI.
That man was in my custody when our plane crashed.
Medicina?
No, no, no, no.
Senor terrorist.
Muy malo. Muy malo.
Terrorista?
Shh, shh, shh, yes.
Uh, necesito un radio.
Radio? Sí, sí.
Do you have a gun? Pistola? Pistola?
Uh, I don't -- No comprendo.
No, slow down.
Please slow down.
I believe he said the pistol is in the toolbox.
Come in.
Coast Guard just intercepted a distress call on the Gulf.
Some Cuban fishing vessel.
Keen was on board.
So she's alive?
You can come in, Aram.
Sorry, I just wanted to hear the update, which is...
the greatest update ever.
Did you talk to her?
No, but we heard her voice.
The pilot was in the middle of giving the coordinates
when the transmission cut out.
The signal cut out? Why? Could you get it back?
All that matters is that
the search teams have a target now.
They're gonna find that boat.
Agent Ressler...the signal. What aren't you telling me?
Keen's voice.
The last thing we heard
was her asking if there was a gun on board.
Honor the sacred,
Honor the Earth,
and everyone who shares it.
Honor the elders...
the 4-legged, the 2-legged,
the winged ones,
the plant and animal, people.
Walk in beauty and balance.
I take photo for Facebook, yeah?
You don't want your money?
I need to know that you're gonna safely deliver that baby to Kirk.
His jet is waiting at M.I.A.
Put the girl into Kirk's hands only.
Entiendo.
纳凯多克里尼
If this man dies --
It'll be your fault. You got him involved.
I need an ETA.
Intercept team should reach your position in 20 minutes.
They want to know how many passengers, over.
Three passengers,
and make sure there's a medical team standing by.
Two passengers. Over.
I know you were lying about believing in me.
But I promise, once we reach our destination,
you'll know that everything I've told you is true.
Of course you believe that. You're a classic narcissist.
You were, what, abused as a child? Abandoned?
Made to feel powerless?
You must've suffered some sick, traumatic, dark event
to believe that the sick, traumatic dark things you've done to me
and everyone I care about could ever result in me loving you.
You're doing fine, Maisy.
He should be here any minute.
Sorry about Nikos.
You did your job.
I know, but...
I didn't mean to...
He knew where my baby was, all right?
That's the only reason I pushed so hard.
Why are you telling me this?
Because he's your friend.
So you want me to make you feel better?
Everyone wants me to make things easier for them.
Cleaner.
That's what I am, after all, the Cleaner.
Just forget I brought it up.
In my desire to make life easier for your baby,
I betrayed Raymond,
and now he doesn't know what to do with me.
Well, he knows what he has to do,
and he wants me to make it easier for him.
But I won't.
I'm not here to make him feel better,
and I'm not here to make you feel better, Tom.
I need some air.
Where's my daughter?!
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?!
Where -- where's my daughter? Huh? Where is she?
Tom!
Let's get out of the heat.
Thank you.
Of course, Raymond.
Found your boat near Madeira Bay,
a few miles offshore.
It's being escorted to a nearby marina.
Was there anyone on board?
Where's the survivor?
Excuse me.
FBI. We need a minute.
Sir, the woman, the one who was with you,
where is she?
No entiendo.
They took her away in a speedboat.
Who took her away?
Terrorista.
Where the hell are they?
Put Romina on the phone. I want Agnes to see her mother.
Where is she?
We'll all be together soon.
Hi, Agnes. Hi.
Did you hear that?
We're gonna be together soon.
I love you.
This'll be quick,
as I have no time and less patience.
Tell me where Alexander Kirk
took Elizabeth Keen and her daughter.
The strong silent type.
You're not doing much to break down stereotypes here.
I'm not afraid of pain.
Or dying, I'm sure.
You know, some years back, I was hiking Devils Tower
for a bracing dip in the spiritual vortex,
when who did I run into
but the tribal leader of the Lakota Nation,
a man of vast responsibility.
He invited me to witness
the extreme version of the Sun Dance ritual.
Not just anyone can attend the Sun Dance.
True, and you can't get a table at The Fat Duck
without a reservation.
But I find in either case,
a generous donation gets you in the teepee.
I watched a tribal member, much like yourself,
suspend himself from a cottonwood tree
with flesh hooks through his chest.
Three hours he dangled,
skin stretched like salt water taffy,
while he left his body
to communicate with the Great Spirit.
Like you, the man on that tree didn't fear death.
But you know what terrified him?
The thought of eternity on earth,
trapped in a dark box,
surrounded by rotting flesh,
forever.
I hear that's why some Native people leave spirit holes
in their caskets, to allow their souls to pass on to
the next great hunting ground in the sky.
After I shoot you, sir,
you will be locked in an airtight, concrete crypt,
unless you tell me what I need to know
before those figures stop dancing.
Kirk said they're going to the Summer Palace.
That's all I know.
Yes.
I know the Summer Palace.
What is this place?
It's yours. It belongs to you and Agnes, of course.
It's a lovely location to raise a little girl,
don't you think?
The armed goons don't do much for the landscape.
Well, the coercion was necessary and temporary.
All I ever intended to do was show you,
prove to you who you are, who I am.
And then you can choose for yourself.
Like a Russian fairy tale.
That's right.
Excuse me, Elizabeth. I have much more to show you,
but my physician is waiting for me.
Hello, Elizabeth. My name is Katja.
You can think of me as the Palace Keeper.
Palace?
The Summer Palace.
It's what Mr. Kirk calls the cottage.
Anything you need during your stay, let me know.
Director Cooper.
I know where Elizabeth is, Harold,
where Kirk is taking Agnes.
Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.
Kirk owns a cottage there where he would go
to escape the dreary summers in Novosibirsk.
Are they hurt? Injured?
I don't know and I can't find out.
I'm deep in the heart of Amarillo, Texas.
How quickly can your people get there?
Agents Ressler and Navabi are flying back from Miami.
I can redirect their plane.
I'll send you a location.
I'll handle this quickly.
You always do, Kate.
Can I get you something else?
Yes. My daughter.
I understand, Elizabeth.
I know some of what you've been through,
but little Agnes will be here soon.
And when she's here, you will need your strength.
Tell me about Kirk.
How long have you known him?
I have worked here for nine years.
I took over from my mother.
She worked my entire childhood
maintaining the Summer Palace.
So you know him well?
No, actually, I don't.
He hasn't visited here in years.
It's been...
too painful for him.
Until now.
卡希坦卡故事
This was my bedroom.
Welcome home, Masha.
I promised you the truth.
But... there was a fire. I...
I shot my father. I remember.
What's the memory of a small child?
You didn't remember me or your mother or this room.
Reddington lied to you, Masha.
He told you your father was dead,
but thanks to you -- what you did on the water --
I'm very much alive.
All the stories Reddington's told you about who he is
and his connection to you --
he knew you were looking for answers
and he took advantage of that to re-enter your life.
But the answers you've been looking for are here.
Reddington, he was in love with your mother
and he's obsessed with you.
But it can't be true.
But you know it is.
I'm sorry. I said too much.
You must be feeling overwhelmed.
I'll go and check on your daughter's arrival.
Do you know why I call this cottage the Summer Palace?
We came here for a vacation one July,
and my little princess loved it.
It's been a palace ever since.
Spread out! Come on, let's go!
Return fire!
No.
Move in! Move in!
Hands in the air! In the air!
Stand down!
Stand down, she's one of ours.
Secure the house. Find Kirk.
Find that child.
He's gone,
and if Agnes is with him, she's gone, too.
He's waiting for you inside.
Where are we?
Home. Your home.
Let's go.
What is this place?
I'm gonna find her.
Stay with the car.
There are places back here
that have never borne a human footprint.
53,000 acres of virgin wilderness,
all but one owned by the Bureau of Land Management.
One acre, a jewel.
A single buildable acre.
Like a flawless diamond set in a sea of emeralds.
The real estate equivalent of a unicorn.
I acquired it some years ago from a family
who had held it in trust for over a century and a half.
Beautiful.
Yes.
You understand, Kate, that I --
Have no choice?
Isn't that the speech, Raymond?
That I know too much?
Every single one of your weaknesses,
all your faults,
all your secrets.
I dedicated my life to you.
You entrusted me with everything you value --
your freedom, your life,
a child.
I have never failed you.
What you see as a betrayal of trust
was actually a fulfillment of your wishes,
to protect your interests.
No more, no less.
You presumed to decide what was best for me.
Even if I resolve the anger,
the pain you caused...
I can't trust you.
Ever.
I'm standing before a stranger.
And yet, I know you believe
what you did was best for Elizabeth,
which is why I brought you here.
You've told me you've always wanted
a pristine, unspoiled place to live out your days in peace.
So the acre is yours.
For all eternity.
