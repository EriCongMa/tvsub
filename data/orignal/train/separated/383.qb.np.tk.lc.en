over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
yeah . that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
we had a very good night , aunt m.
i &apos;d say any night where i don &apos;t have to clean up
your broken bottles is a good night .
boys , danke . you &apos;ve been such a godsend to me
these past few weeks .
no , thank you .
honestly , hanging out here has been just cool .
yeah , i mean , if it weren &apos;t for you ,
timothy and i would be stuck somewhere in the middle of georgia ,
bulldozing dirt for dad &apos;s company .
not exactly how you &apos;d dream of whiling away
your days between semesters .
i &apos;m going to miss you boys
when you have to go back home for school .
we &apos;ll miss you , too .
ah . goeie nag , boys .
good night .
night , aunt m.
you know , i get why dad moved away
from johannesburg back in the day ,
but i don &apos;t get why he doesn &apos;t like coming back here to visit .
who knows ? you know how dad is .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m gonna take the rest of this trash out .
you need me to dump anything else ?
nah , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m gonna head upstairs .
okay .
tim , are you okay ?
tim ?
tim !
hey , quit screwing around !
hey . hey , what happened ?
brandon smit , 22,
a senior at hallridge university ,
and his brother , timothy , 18,
a freshman at burlington crest college .
both boys hail from roswell , georgia .
they were on a break visiting johannesburg , south africa ,
where they &apos;d taken temporary jobs in a bar
working for their aunt , mariam nell ,
who reported them missing 24 hours ago .
then eight hours ago ,
police discovered the body of timothy smit ,
mutilated and staged in an abandoned shanty
just inside the azaria district ,
one of the poorest neighborhoods in johannesburg
and 12 miles from their aunt &apos;s bar .
brandon &apos;s still missing ,
and it would appear that his murder is consistent with this .
one month ago , lara bosch , 29,
was kidnapped from her home in pretoria ,
40 minutes north of johannesburg .
her body was later found like this , also inside azaria .
you know , the desecration of these bodies ,
it &apos;s very specific .
bodies caked in white clay ,
spikes driven through foreheads ,
tongues severed .
it &apos;s derived from a rare southern african divining practice ,
which is meant to represent umkovu ,
which are basically corpses that have been dug up and revived by a shaman
in order to do his bidding .
so you think our unsub believes that he &apos;s recruiting
his own zombie soul brigade ?
now given the present status of brandon smit &apos;s abduction ,
the south african special forces brigade
have taken charge of the mission .
paramilitary tactics are a bit of a blunt instrument ,
don &apos;t you think ?
that might be why our ambassador
and the south african foreign minister
have asked us to work with the s.f.b.
well , time is not on our side .
brandon &apos;s been missing for over 36 hours now .
i mean , by the book , after 72,
a rescue mission usually turns into a recovery mission .
yeah , but if our unsub planned on killing both brothers ,
why wouldn &apos;t he have just done it at the same time
and then arrange their bodies side by side ?
because , for whatever reason ,
our unsub &apos;s not done with brandon ... yet .
as terrible as that sounds ,
it may mean we still have time to save him .
where &apos;s my brother ?
hey ! what have you done with him ? !
wena ungufakazi wami .
wena ungufakazi wami .
what ? what do you want ?
please !
no !
第一季 第十集
a zulu proverb reminds us , &quot; hope does not kill . &quot;
yes , we &apos;ll take care of it .
welcome to you .
i am brigadier general yazeen zwane .
you must be unit chief jack garrett , eh ?
yes , i am ,
and this is my team , supervisory special agents
clara seger , matt simmons ,
and mae jarvis .
if you would , follow me , please .
i have been in constant communication
with your ambassador , as well as our foreign minister ,
and i assure you of the utmost cooperation
with this mission .
i appreciate that , general .
however , we are concerned
about the application of counterinsurgency tactics
in this investigation .
i understand .
i suppose it seemed like , uh , using a cannon to swat a fly .
obviously , we &apos;d feel more comfortable
coordinating this mission
based on a comprehensive criminal profile .
we really need to get to work on that immediately .
brandon &apos;s life depends on it .
i could not agree with you more .
that is why we &apos;ve called in our country &apos;s premier profiler
to assist you --
lieutenant ananda doshi .
i am sorry . will there be a problem with that ?
no . no problem .
but i &apos;ll wanna walk through the body dump site with agent seger ,
and have agent simmons here inspect the abduction site
while agent jarvis assists
with timothy smit &apos;s autopsy .
certainly .
i will arrange for your escort
and for lieutenant doshi to meet you
at the azaria scene .
you sure you &apos;re gonna be okay
working with her again ?
i &apos;m sure .
is this the same ananda doshi
that &apos;s responsible for catching gabriel imani ,
a.k.a. &quot; the archangel , &quot; in madagascar ?
didn &apos;t you work that case , boss ?
yeah , which is why i &apos;m bringing it up .
look , if they want her , we got her .
we have a job to do .
why did i allow my sons to go ?
i insisted you let them , armand .
it &apos;s not like they hadn &apos;t been there before .
they missed your sister .
then she should have come to visit us .
i &apos;ll still never understand why she chose to stay
in that godforsaken place after i left .
mr. and mrs. smit , i know this a difficult time for you ,
but you cannot blame yourselves
for what happened to timothy and brandon .
i wish i could believe you ,
but a man &apos;s sole responsibility
is to protect the ones he loves .
that &apos;s why i left south africa 25 years ago .
i met my wife .
i wanted to start a family in a better place .
i understand , sir . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i just have a couple more questions .
given the neighborhood ,
did the boys ever mention
being hassled by any of the local gangs ?
no . why ?
nothing specific .
we just have to evaluate every possible threat .
now , mr. smit , you immigrated from south africa in 1990
and then became a u.s. citizen in 2004 ?
that &apos;s correct .
and your only other living relative in south africa
is your sister , mariam nell ?
is that right ?
yes .
the boys just adored mariam .
she and i were the ones who made the arrangements for them
to stay and work down there for a few weeks .
the only security camera the police found
was situated over this bar pointing at the cash register .
yeah . the only one i thought i needed .
that , and the geweer behind the bar .
sorry . the -- the what ?
i bought a gun . a .38 .
right , but no gun was -- was found .
it wasn &apos;t any help at all , was it ?
i just never should have left them .
ms. nell , did you or the boys ever receive any threats ?
ja .
a couple of ibhuloho came around a few months back .
they wanted me to start paying them protection money ,
but i refused to pay them .
you think they did this to my nephews ?
do you think you could identify these men ?
ja , i might .
uh , just one last thing .
you recognize this woman ?
no .
her name is lara bosch .
bosch ?
yes . does that ring a bell ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
you think she &apos;s involved somehow ?
she &apos;s another victim , ma &apos;am .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard doshi &apos;s methodology
can be a little unorthodox ,
but you never told me what happened between the two of you .
what caused the falling out ?
i &apos;m not sure this is the time .
i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s fair to have me go in there flying blind .
doshi may have been trained by scotland yard
in forensic psychology ,
but she doesn &apos;t really see herself as a profiler .
then how does she see herself ?
ungesabi .
ngizwe .
wena akudingeki wesabe .
timothy , speak , if you will .
it &apos;s been too long , jack .
i &apos;m told you now run
your own personal division of the fbi .
it &apos;s not my personal division .
it &apos;s the bureau &apos;s international response team .
i &apos;m the unit chief .
and this is s.s.a. clara seger .
lieutenant doshi , your reputation precedes you .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s my cross to bear .
the candles ? i &apos;m sure you waited --
until the scene was processed . yes , i did .
unfortunately , the time elapsed was far too long .
if timothy found his way back here ,
he did not linger for long .
you mean timothy &apos;s spirit ?
no . i mean timothy himself .
i do not subscribe to the western dualism
of physical versus spiritual .
when we die , there &apos;s not some part of us that lives on .
it &apos;s the whole of us that evolves into
a new and marvelous incarnation .
uh , if that is true , then why would timothy come back here ?
because the real tragedy of murder is
that our transmigration is so abrupt that we get scared
and try to cling to this flesh and bone ,
thus a homicide victim lingers at his crime scene .
well , based on the lack of blood evidence ,
maybe timothy didn &apos;t come back here
because this wasn &apos;t where he was murdered and mutilated .
mm . just where he was staged .
yeah , staged in close proximity of where lara &apos;s body was ,
just a quarter @-@ mile away .
this azaria district --
it appears to mean something to our unsub .
but he &apos;s a poacher . he likes to hunt across a wide terrain .
victoria to johannesburg --
that &apos;s nearly 9,000 square kilometers .
which isn &apos;t inconsistent with our gang theory .
but the explicit precision of mutilations ,
it seems more likely to be a physical manifestation
of our unsub &apos;s internal fantasy psychosis .
you think so ?
cause i think they look like very convincing
&quot; don &apos;t you dare mess with me &quot; warnings .
again , not inconsistent with the gang .
the only question is , to whom are these warnings directed ?
still , why go to all this trouble ?
if these are fear tactics , they seem extreme .
this is south africa , jack .
we &apos;ve been through some serious strife .
if you really want to put the fear of god into us ,
you definitely need to step up your game .
igazi .
wena ungufakazi wami .
iqiniso .
mariam nell &apos;s physical description of the gang members
that approached her gave us these .
we have yet to i.d. them .
okay , if all this is related to the gang ,
not only do we need to ask ourselves about their connection
to the victims , we need to ask , why now ?
what &apos;s changed for them ?
you know what i find most fascinating
about american criminal procedure
is the obsessive fixation with applying logical motivations
to inherently aberrant and impassioned behaviors .
you would prefer that we apply a more emotional logic to our analysis ?
at some point , we must draw ourselves
into the hearts and minds of these unknown subjects .
i disagree . that approach is self @-@ indulgent and reckless .
and why i would prefer the guidance of the dead .
gang or no gang ,
these murders aren &apos;t just about fear .
they &apos;re about recognition .
bodies left to be found .
the stark brutality of their desecration .
and holding on to a hostage without so much as a word
to the families or to the authorities ,
as if demanding , &quot; do i have your undivided attention ? &quot;
and he won &apos;t stop until he feels satisfied
that we know exactly how much power he has
over life and death .
if we can find a way to deal with nosumi ,
would he sign the contract ?
maar dit is nie wat hy gesê het nie .
no , we already agreed that if we throw that in ,
then we close the deal .
so come on , gareth . dit is regtig nie moeilik nie .
gareth ? gareth ?
i &apos;m sorry . i have to call you back .
i must say ,
i &apos;m surprised you agreed to work with me again ,
considering the way we left it .
well , experience has taught me to pick my battles .
besides , the way we left it was ...
you caught the bad guy .
but you still don &apos;t trust me .
trust isn &apos;t the issue , is it ?
another body has been discovered in botes ,
the heart of azaria .
is it brandon ?
we have yet to make
a positive identification of the victim ,
since entry into this particular quarter of the district is precarious .
well , let &apos;s gear up and get going .
i &apos;m afraid i cannot allow it .
but we were allowed access to the last crime scene
under similar circumstances .
regrettably , local law enforcement has ceded
control of certain neighborhoods to gang elements .
it would be best for my officers and me
to secure the crime scene .
lieutenant doshi , if you would . excuse us .
wait . hold on . how come she gets to go ?
because she talks to the dead ,
and they do not bide at the scene for long .
does one of you speak to the dead , too ?
he can .
you good ?
clear !
you want we should let you bleed out
right here in the street ?
no , no , no , no !
who ordered you to take us out ?
ingwe ! it was ingwe !
who the hell is ingwe ? !
probably an alias . we will run it .
i &apos;m going to order a lockdown of botes .
that is 20 square blocks .
i won &apos;t be able to hold it for very long .
i get it . we need to work fast .
that &apos;s not brandon .
no , it &apos;s not .
older than brandon , but not by much .
and there &apos;s been no missing persons report recently ,
so no one &apos;s had any time to miss him .
our unsub &apos;s window between abduction and staging is closing .
don &apos;t move . you &apos;ll frighten him .
let us bring you peace on your journey .
ngubani owenze lokhu kuwe .
please .
ungahambi .
oh ! no .
he &apos;s gone .
ananda , we don &apos;t have time for this .
brandon is still out there .
they &apos;re related --
this man and the woman , the lawyer , lara bosch .
besides that little voice inside your head ,
how do you know that ?
it &apos;s his voice , jack .
well , it &apos;s speaking to me , too , and so is this scene .
our unsub was right here .
based on the wounds , this accelerated pattern of attack ,
i &apos;d say it was less than two hours ago .
which means he came prepared .
which means he executes with military @-@ style precision .
so we may be looking for someone trained as a child soldier .
in the congo , sierra leone , or the sudan .
that would be in step
with his need to send this message of fear .
i agree . agent seger was right .
this is a manifestation of a inner fantasy psychosis .
whoever we &apos;re dealing with ,
he &apos;s existing in a psychic borderland ,
straddling the line between this reality
and the fantasy world he &apos;s creating for himself .
with that kind of dysfunction ,
he &apos;ll probably need to hide behind someone else &apos;s identity .
or possibly even masquerade
in another creature &apos;s persona .
kill me already ! just get it over with !
you must bear witness .
you will be the one after the reckoning
who tells them all the truth .
iqiniso .
you have news about brandon ?
no , not yet . i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s just a discrepancy i found i &apos;d like to clear up .
what do you mean ?
south african documents indicate
that brandon was born there .
but your wife &apos;s records reveal adoption papers for him .
agent montgomery , maybe it has something to do
with my having started the process
of adopting brandon in the u.s.
before armand and i married in south africa .
does it really matter
if brandon is not our biological son ?
no , no , of course not .
i &apos;m just trying to understand why there &apos;s a difference
between south african documents and american .
obviously , someone made a clerical error
8,000 miles away .
general zwane wanted you to know
that they have identified the suspect known as &quot; ingwe , &quot;
the man who ordered the attack on our team .
it &apos;s an alias for paul ntombi .
says here he was suspected of being a top ibhuloho lieutenant .
even though he &apos;s been behind bars for 25 years .
kidnapped as a boy ,
ntombi was a child soldier in mozambique .
now we believe he &apos;s been in control of the ibhuloho gang
for more than a decade .
that &apos;s interesting .
possibly reaching out from prison .
he very well could be the man behind our unsub .
so we might just wanna have a little chat with this guy .
did you know capital punishment was abolished in south africa
on the 6th of june , 1995 ?
so hypothetically , if i were involved with this ,
since i am serving life , how do you imagine punishing me ?
well , hypothetically , paul ,
international laws regarding criminal conspiracies
resulting in the death of americans
leans pretty heavy in our favor .
meaning we could pack you up , take you home ,
where a lethal injection will be waiting for you .
ah , yes , you americans , .
always with your &quot; kill them all , let god sort them out . &quot;
i love it .
hey , we are not playing games here .
this is all a game , my dear .
why do you think general zwane wants you to waste your time
talking to me ?
we &apos;re talking to you
because you ordered some of your boys to kill us .
and we think that order has something to do with the fact
that you &apos;re trying to protect whoever &apos;s doing this .
we can link your gang to the victims
and you to a suspect .
it &apos;s only a matter of time , paul .
but you help us catch this killer ,
you can stay here , serving life
like nothing ever happened .
the thing is , i don &apos;t want you to catch him .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
not enough afrikaans blood has been spilled
to make up for the blood of my ancestors .
yeah , i &apos;d say you &apos;ve really done your ancestors proud ,
killing and enslaving your brothers over drugs .
don &apos;t you lecture me about my history .
if it weren &apos;t for mandela ,
there &apos;d be no need for ibhuloho .
if madiba would have done what was necessary
and exterminate the white devil ,
there &apos;d be plenty for all my people .
and what , you think you &apos;re the savior
of all those left behind ?
let me tell you something .
you are nothing but a parasite .
i will tell you something .
you want to know what this is ?
&quot; helter skelter . &quot;
the beginning of the end .
there is a debt of blood out there ,
and i will tell you , my dear ,
payback is a bitch .
20 square blocks of the botes neighborhood of azaria
continue to be cordoned off by law enforcement this evening
as the manhunt continues for the suspects responsible
for the brutal slayings of attorney lara bosch ,
american tourist timothy smit ,
and what is now a third , yet unidentified male victim .
the suspects are also believed to be holding
american brandon smit ...
brandon smit .
you don &apos;t think he could be your old friend &apos;s son ,
do you , pa ?
pa ?
what ?
brandon . armand &apos;s oldest boy .
no , it can &apos;t be .
armand and his family moved away years ago .
ja , to the u.s.
it can &apos;t be the same boy .
i got an i.d. on our john doe .
i pulled titanium dental implant that had a p.n. number on it
which traced back to a local dentist ,
who had a patient by the name of kurt adams .
now here &apos;s the kicker --
family court records indicate that kurt adams
is lara bosch &apos;s half @-@ brother .
doesn &apos;t actually look like lara knew she had a brother .
says here that kurt is the illegitimate son
of her father , rowan bosch .
okay , and here &apos;s where it gets even more curious .
as far as anyone can tell , rowan is still alive ,
but four weeks ago , when the police tried to notify him of his daughter &apos;s death ,
he was nowhere to be found .
so you &apos;re not thinking he &apos;s a suspect .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m thinking ,
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a coincidence that our victims
are either the offspring of rowan bosch
or armand smit .
so there has to be some kind of connection
between the two fathers .
jack , hand me paul ntombi &apos;s file .
you think you know a link between ntombi and the fathers ?
i think i now remember
seeing this umkovu mutilation before .
yes . ntombi was detained for questioning
on february 5 , 1989,
in connection with the murder of constable sara miller .
why is that significant ?
i &apos;ll show you .
constable sara miller --
her assassination in the winter of 1989
set south african defense forces on high alert ,
particularly the office of state security .
that &apos;s like south africa &apos;s k.g.b.
only worse .
their sole purpose was to preserve and protect apartheid
by any means necessary .
in its dying days , the office of state security
used constable miller &apos;s martyrdom
as an excuse to form a covert unit
to stamp out the anti @-@ apartheid movement once and for all .
it was code @-@ named &quot; pretorius . &quot;
in 11 months , pretorius was responsible for the torture
and murder of 14 anti @-@ apartheid activists .
but i suspect no one knew
what crimes pretorius had committed
until after the fall of apartheid .
1995 , when the truth and reconciliation commission was formed .
that &apos;s where this comes from .
yes , the truth and reconciliation commission
was set up as an open forum
for people to confess their crimes
without fear of prosecution .
and in the name of national reconciliation ,
the names of the three pretorius agents
were never disclosed ,
their crimes against humanity never to be punished .
and so it would seem that like my fellow south africans ,
i &apos;ve not only tried to forgive , apparently i nearly forgot .
and now years later ,
our unsub mimics this particular murder .
because maybe he &apos;s identified these three men
and is now targeting their children for revenge .
the cruelest punishment of all is
for a parent to bury a child .
in this case , child by blood , if we believe
that he &apos;s keeping brandon alive .
okay , not to be the naysayer here ,
but accusing rowan bosch and armand smit
of being part of this group is a pretty serious thing .
i would feel a lot more comfortable if we had
more to go on than just a theory .
i &apos;ll have monty follow up
with the covert history on bosch and smit .
we might find something
in one of our own intelligence files .
you know , with this latest crime scene ,
i think we might have enough data
for simmons and i to head back to the jet
and build a geo @-@ profile .
and agent jarvis and i can run our criminal profile
against a new pool of potential suspects --
the surviving family members of pretorius &apos; victims .
okay , let &apos;s get to work .
mr. smit , i have something i need to show you .
you recognize this man ?
sorry , i don &apos;t know him .
okay . well , you can clear up one more discrepancy for me .
this man &apos;s name is rowan bosch .
you two have something very interesting in common .
neither one of you is on record as serving
in the south african defense force .
what &apos;s interesting about that
is that military service was compulsory
for all white males until 1993 .
what are you insinuating , son ?
that &apos;d be &quot; agent montgomery , &quot; sir .
we have reason to believe that timothy was murdered
and brandon was taken as payback for pretorius .
you were one of them , weren &apos;t you ?
how dare you accuse me of that ?
what in god &apos;s name is wrong with you ?
what about my son ? where is he ?
i swear , if he dies ,
i will hold you personally responsible ,
agent montgomery .
i &apos;m sorry , jack .
i shouldn &apos;t have confronted him like that .
just when i compared the two bios ,
i realized i had seen the pattern of detail ,
or lack thereof , before ,
in cover stories created for witness protection .
then he had the nerve to look me in the eye and lie .
but his deflection confirms our theory .
he and bosch are two of the three agents of pretorius .
and now we &apos;re face @-@ to @-@ face with
one of the men responsible
for torturing and murdering 14 innocent people --
people who were just fighting for their freedom ,
and there &apos;s not a damn thing we can do
to bring them to justice .
i know , but i think the best thing right now
is to remember the sins of the father
have nothing to do with the son .
we need to stay focused on saving brandon &apos;s life .
you &apos;re right .
how &apos;s it looking ?
oh , well , the biggest challenge has been reconciling
the two axioms of serial killer behavior .
right -- never commit a crime too close to home ,
and never travel further than necessary
to get your victims .
but our unsub is a poacher .
he &apos;s willing to go the extra mile .
which complicates the math for our model .
but monty hooked us up with this program
that helps us compare the patterns of our unsub
with the patterns of past serial killers
active in similar urban terrain .
so ... it should be able to calculate
the highest probable location of our unsub &apos;s home , sweet home .
nice work .
looks like our unsub may be somewhere in briars point .
yeah , but by home , we &apos;re probably not talking
about his residence . this guy wants isolation .
so he might just like this old norris mining industries plant
which closed in 1975 .
clara , you coordinate from the command post .
simmons and i will round up general zwane and his men .
brandon .
‭ let me go . please .
brandon .
what ?
hey . you &apos;re gonna be all right , son .
i &apos;m jack garrett , fbi . you &apos;re safe .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
drop your weapon !
drop it !
beka phansi isibhamu !
do not move ! i will shoot !
his arm &apos;s tied to the chair .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s rowan bosch .
son of a bitch lobotomized him .
thanks .
so bosch is in critical condition .
brandon appears to be stable .
they &apos;re both on their way to the hospital now .
well , that &apos;s good news .
bad news is , our unsub staged the scene
like he knew we were coming .
or he knew this was his end game .
maybe our beast is on his final hunt .
where are we in running the profile against our victims &apos; families ?
nowhere is where we are .
there &apos;s not one viable suspect in the pool .
and there &apos;s still one more agent of pretorius to identify .
even if he is dead ,
his children or blood relatives are in danger .
there is something we &apos;re missing .
about what ? the victims ? pretorius ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i don &apos;t think we &apos;re looking at this the right way .
i mean , it was the last gasp of apartheid .
even president botha was willing to
negotiate with mandela for peace .
something had to be done ,
especially in this security state where ...
where white is black ,
and black is white .
okay , there was a man named david lubbe .
he was arrested and confessed to killing miller .
he died in prison .
monty ?
clara , what if the murder of constable miller
was a false flag ?
what if it had been this covert op
that was designed to incite the social unrest necessary
to justify the creation of pretorius ?
well , if that &apos;s true ...
well , then we need to apply our profile
to the family of sara miller .
do you remember constable miller ?
you remember what you and your pretorius boys
did to my sister ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you have the wrong man !
the wrong man went to prison .
‭ and he died there .
rowan bosch told me everything .
he came to me , dying of cancer , asking for forgiveness .
even had documents to prove every word .
please . there must be something that i could --
you could do ?
yes .
hmm . you can wait with me for your little girl lydia to come home ,
and you can watch as i spill her blood all over this floor .
her blood , and the blood of your grandchild .
constable sara miller &apos;s family was devastated by her death .
none more so than her brother curtis .
he attended david lubbe &apos;s trial every day
and later received a discharge
from the south african national defense force based on concerns about his mental health .
says here miller &apos;s parents passed away in 2000
and curtis inherited the family home in auckland park .
which s.f.b. officers just raided .
there was nothing there .
looks like he cleared out weeks ago .
so curtis miller &apos;s in the wind ,
and we still don &apos;t know who this third pretorius agent is .
his children are in imminent danger .
monty , you &apos;ve held off notifying armand smit and his wife
about brandon &apos;s rescue , right ?
as you requested . so now we have no choice .
the only way to get the name of that third pretorius agent
is for monty to get it from smit himself .
but doesn &apos;t he actually have to admit who he is first ?
that &apos;s exactly what he has to do .
so ... i have news about your son .
we rescued him .
he &apos;s alive and recovering at brisbane hospital .
he was found with rowan bosch ...
or what &apos;s left of him .
rowan bosch ?
is -- is he related to that woman you showed us ?
yes .
he was her father .
he worked with your husband in pretorius .
pretorius ?
this is harassment .
i &apos;ll sue you and the bureau .
armand , what &apos;s going on ?
you go ahead and do that , mr. smit .
but right now is what my grandmother likes to call
a &quot; come to jesus &quot; time .
there are lives at stake .
i know you and bosch were two of three men in pretorius .
i &apos;m gonna need that third man &apos;s name ,
before his children suffer the same fate
as kurt ...
and lara ...
and timothy ,
your own son .
what did you do ?
nothing . i did nothing wrong .
seriously ? you &apos;re just gonna let the blood
of that man &apos;s children be on your hands ?
let &apos;s go , camille .
oh , you think the blood
will just blend in with all the rest , huh ?
hey ! look at him !
now give me the man &apos;s name .
i knew there were secrets about your past ,
but ... i loved you ,
so i never asked you any questions .
we knew a bosch once .
when we first met .
and there was another man .
camille , please .
his name was ...
coetzee .
noah coetzee .
he may still live in bloemfontein .
thank you .
pa ?
no !
pa ?
lydia ! get out !
no ! no ! oh ! please !
my baby , please ! please , my baby !
no , please .
noah , look at this .
my baby , please .
let her go . kill me . i did it .
what did you do ? tell me . tell her .
i murdered your sister .
armand , rowan , and i , we ambushed her
when she was on patrol in azaria .
i wanted to shoot her ,
but rowan wanted to make it look more zulu .
so armand stabbed her .
and i knew the young man we could pin it on .
fbi . let her go .
get out .
curtis , we know the truth about your sister &apos;s murder ,
and we &apos;re here now to punish the men responsible ,
so you don &apos;t have to hurt this woman and her baby . let her go .
you cannot punish these men . they &apos;re protected forever .
no , curtis , you don &apos;t understand .
so i will end them forever .
please .
no !
you have a good team . you should be very proud .
i am .
i understand why you think
my methods diminish the science of criminal profiling .
it &apos;s not magic .
no , it isn &apos;t ,
but i wish you could understand
that you and i are not as different as you think .
in every fiber , in every print ,
in every drop of blood left behind ,
are not the dead speaking to you , jack ?
in a manner of speaking , yes .
but maybe what &apos;s most important
is that i speak for them .
brandon ?
oh , my baby .
mom .
armand smit ...
you &apos;re under arrest for murder .
murder ? what murder ? what are you talking about ?
stop ! i have complete immunity .
the commission decreed it .
you &apos;re right .
you have immunity for the 14 murders you committed
while you were an agent of pretorius .
but not for the one that created it .
the staged execution of constable sara miller .
and there is no statute of limitations on murder .
court &apos;s already granted your extradition .
you &apos;re going home to stand trial .
get him out of here .
it may have been delayed , but justice wasn &apos;t denied .
