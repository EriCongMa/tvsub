for over a century , i have lived in secret
until now . i know the risk .
but i have to know her .
elena-- she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
you have no idea of the future i have planned for us .
you , me , and damon .
our love for katherine wasn &apos;t real , damon .
katherine never compelled me .
i knew everything .
it was real for me .
i &apos;m going to bring her back .
tell me how to get into the tomb .
the grimoire .
where is it ?
check the journal . jonathan gilbert &apos;s .
can i borrow your ancestor &apos;s journal ?
i gave it to my history teacher .
alaric saltzman .
damon .
so the grimoire ... that was emily &apos;s , right ?
that &apos;s what you need to reverse the spell ?
i &apos;ll help you .
ok .
i told damon that i &apos;d help him get katherine back .
but it was a lie . i can &apos;t let him do it .
then don &apos;t . and i &apos;ll help you . whatever it takes .
please !
please , help us !
please , my husband , he &apos;s been hurt !
please help him !
what are you doing out here in the middle of the night ?
it &apos;s not safe .
no . no , sir .
it &apos;s not safe .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
what happens to the bodies ?
well , i &apos;ll take them into the woods
and the other animals will finish them off .
are you sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
i &apos;m ready .
i want you to turn me .
when it &apos;s time .
kiss me .
you should get a taste .
sorry .
don &apos;t be .
soon you won &apos;t be able to get enough .
mmm , good morning .
i could get used to this .
rise and shine , sleepyheads .
damon ! please !
what are you doing ?
oh , stop being smutty .
seriously , get out of here !
if i see something i haven &apos;t seen before ,
i &apos;ll throw a dollar at it . now listen ,
we have some very important business to discuss .
and it has to be right now ?
well , we have lots to do , now that we &apos;re all friends
and working toward a common goal .
so , in order to open the tomb ,
we need to find the journal
to get the grimoire to open the spells .
first things first-- since you are elena gilbert ,
you &apos;re on journal duty .
since when am i helping ?
well , stefan &apos;s helping , and you &apos;ve taken up residence
in stefan &apos;s bed , ergo ...
you don &apos;t have to do anything you don &apos;t want to do .
i &apos;ll look for it tonight .
good .
how do we know that this journal
will hold the location of the grimoire ?
we &apos;re really going to take the word of this vampire ?
it seems like a bit of a dim
in lieu of any other options .
ok , what exactly is a grimoire , anyway ?
it &apos;s a witch &apos;s cookbook .
every spell that a witch casts
is unique unto itself ,
so every witch would document their work .
yeah . cookbook .
what about our mystery vampire ?
dimwit obviously wasn &apos;t working alone ,
so whoever &apos;s out there knows who we are .
and i don &apos;t like that disadvantage , so ...
chop , chop .
you know , i really like this menage @-@ three some team thing .
it &apos;s got a bit of a kink to it .
don &apos;t screw it up .
he does have--
oh , right , yeah .
ok .
oh ! no , come here .
we shouldn &apos;t ...
what are you doing ? stop it !
make me .
yes ?
excuse me , miss katherine .
miss pearl is here to see you .
i &apos;ll be down soon .
please ask her to wait .
thank you , emily .
fun &apos;s over .
hmm , no .
it &apos;s good to see you , pearl .
perhaps we could talk outside .
emily , would you please tell mr. salvatore
that i &apos;ve stepped away ?
which one ?
both .
how long do you plan on staying with the salvatores ?
people talk , katherine .
you , carrying on with both brothers ,
doesn &apos;t help the situation .
the salvatores have been kind to take me in .
as far as everyone here knows ,
i &apos;m a poor orphan girl from atlanta ,
lost her family in the fires .
a match you lit , no doubt .
honey , please be careful .
honorary fell came by the apothecary yesterday
with a case of this elixir .
she asked that it be sold at a reduced rate .
i don &apos;t follow .
try it .
what in hell ?
vervain .
why is there--
they know .
they &apos;re trying to find us ,
and they &apos;re getting crafty about it .
the townspeople ingesting vervain ?
that &apos;s inconvenient .
it might be time for us to move on again .
no . i like it here .
i &apos;m not interested in leaving just yet .
can we go , mama ?
is something wrong ?
hey , it &apos;me again .
anna . soccer chick
and foosball champion .
i &apos;ll be at the grill later , if you want ,
you know , a rematch , or whatever .
who are you calling ?
jeremy gilbert .
you &apos;re not , like , into him , are you ?
i need him for something . get over it .
oh ! mmm !
damn it !
dude , you gotta stop doing that .
i know . i just-- i keep forgetting .
you &apos;re new .
you &apos;ll get it .
you found the gilbert journal ?
does that look like the gilbert journal ?
well , it &apos;s old and musty ,
and how am i supposed to know the difference ?
i don &apos;t know , i figured maybe , just maybe ,
you &apos;ve been paying
a little bit of attention since we met .
you know , you don &apos;t have to talk down to me .
i &apos;m not stupid .
here .
drink .
i don &apos;t want you getting itchy around the witch .
she can sense if you &apos;re weak .
when can we go hunting again ?
this tastes old . i want fresh blood .
when we get that tomb open ,
you can kill anyone you want .
for now , just stay focused on bonnie
while i try to get the journal back from jeremy &apos;s teacher .
why did you choose me ?
i needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears .
small town bartender fit the bill
there are plenty of bartenders to choose from .
why me ?
you were sad then .
you lacked purpose .
you needed me .
do you think damon really believes us ?
that we &apos;re both trying to help him ?
i don &apos;t think damon knows what to believe .
trust isn &apos;t something that comes naturally to him .
you know ...
i realy think that damon believes
that everything he &apos;s done , every move that he &apos;s made ,
he &apos;s done for love .
it &apos;s twisted , but kind of sad .
there are other ways to get what you want .
you don &apos;t have to kill people .
damon has no regard for human life .
he enjoys inflicting pain on others .
for 145 years ,
every single time that i have let my guard down
and let damon back into my life ,
he &apos;s done something to make me regret that .
i &apos;m not going to make that mistake again .
so what do you think will happen
if the tomb gets opened and damon gets katherine back ?
i think that no matter what damon promises ,
a lot of people will die .
that &apos;s jonathan gilbert .
what &apos;s this ?
what are you guys doing ?
hey . just going through some stuff ,
feeling sentimental .
dad had this whole family journal from years ago .
i thought i &apos;d dig it up .
jonathan gilbert &apos;s journal ?
yeah , what do you know about it ?
i just did a history report on it .
oh . so where is it now ?
i gave it to mr. saltzman . he wanted to see it .
i met barnett and giuseppe this evening .
i saw the scepticism in
their eyes when i showed them the compass .
we &apos;re supposed to believe that can track one of them ?
what is it , magic ?
it &apos;s science .
i &apos;ll believe it when i see it .
i &apos;ve been thinking about this church idea .
i believe it could work .
excuse me , father .
i didn &apos;t know you had guests .
we &apos;ll be done in a few minutes , son .
i &apos;ll come back . forgive me , mr. gilbert ,
mr. lockwood .
have you told them ?
not yet .
giuseppe , we need all the men we can get .
i &apos;ll tell them .
you can count on both my boys .
hello ?
hello ?
someone there ?
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
have a seat .
what is this , compressed air ?
did you make it yourself ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m not going to hurt you ...
unless you try that again .
now ...
who are you ?
i &apos;m a teacher .
are we going to have to do this the hard way ?
i &apos;m also a historian .
and while researching virginia , i--
made a few discoveries about your town .
so you show up like van helsing .
come on .
tell me the truth .
my wife was a parapsychologist .
she spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area .
it was her work that led me here .
where &apos;s your wife ?
dead .
a vampire killed her .
where &apos;s the gilbert journal ?
what do you want with it ?
where is it ?
it &apos;s on my desk .
no , it &apos;s not .
it was on my desk .
anything ?
not yet . just a lot of gibberish .
yeah , some people just shouldn &apos;t journal .
i thought this gilbert was the brains .
don &apos;t you have a date ?
yep .
wish me luck .
ehh .
i saw her again today--
the most beautiful woman in town ,
with a name just as pretty , pearl .
have you thought any more of what i &apos;ve said ?
we &apos;ll leave soon , pearl , i promise .
i need to take care of a few things first .
you &apos;re going to turn both of them , aren &apos;t you ?
katherine , please .
be careful .
we &apos;ll all be safe , i promise .
mr. gilbert &apos;s coming .
quick , your cheeks .
perfectly rosy .
miss pearl .
may i have a moment ?
yes , mr. gilbert .
i &apos;m still waiting for you
to explain that comet in the sky .
your mother has an admirer .
as descendants of the founding families ,
they &apos;ll want to know that they can count on you .
of course they can .
is there any doubt ?
i &apos;m not sure your bother damon
understands the importance of duty .
damon left the confederacy on principle .
it was his choice
and should be respected .
you &apos;ll forgive me if i have trouble respecting a deserter .
well , i never asked for your respect .
good for you , damon .
because all i have is disappointment .
you said the town is in trouble ?
there &apos;s been too many deaths .
it is time for us to fight back
and stop these killers .
killers ? what are you talking about ?
we live amongst demons .
you &apos;re being cryptic now , father .
why don &apos;t you just say the word ?
vampires .
they exist .
and they live amongst us .
but we have a plan to kill them .
and you &apos;re going to help us .
my father never approved of anyone i dated ,
which only made me want them more .
of course .
what about you ?
there were a few guys .
logan isn &apos;t the only loser i &apos;ve dated .
they ever find him ? or is he still missing ?
he &apos;s not missing .
he &apos;s in the bahamas working on his tan .
very entitled , that one .
marches to his own drum .
he &apos;s foul .
they &apos;re all snooty .
hello , elena .
hey . where have you been ?
we &apos;re cooking dinner .
is stefan with you ?
he &apos;ll be here soon .
how long have you been aware of me ?
i learned just recently .
what about your brother ?
you met damon .
who do you think killed my wife ?
are you certain it was damon ?
i witnessed it .
if you &apos;re here for revenge ,
this is going to end very badly for you .
i just want to find out what happened to my wife .
i thought you you said that damon--
yeah .
i saw him
draining the life out of her .
he must have heard me coming .
he just ... disappeared .
so did her body .
they never found her .
damon can never know why you &apos;re here .
he &apos;ll kill you without blinking .
i can take care of mysf .
no , you can &apos;t .
i can help you .
if you let me .
don &apos;t do that .
do what ?
you know what . that move was deliberate .
well , yeah , i was deliberately trying
to get to the sink .
speaking of stefan ,
where is he ?
he &apos;s missing family night ,
which i am enjoying immensely .
is it real ?
is what real ?
this renewed sense of brotherhood .
can i trust him ?
yes , you can trust him .
can i trust him ?
i &apos;m wearing vervain , damon . it &apos;s not going to work .
i &apos;m not compelling you .
i just want you to answer me .
honestly .
of course you can .
you can trust me , mr. salvatore .
i would never cheat .
i &apos;m losing over here .
again !
she &apos;s good .
i almost believe she genuinely likes him .
perhaps she does .
she knows father would have her killed if he knew the truth .
not if we talk to him ;
explained how we feel .
he could help us keep her safe .
have you gone mad ?
no , no , father would drive the stake in her himself !
that &apos;s not true . we can trust him .
no , no , not with this .
please , pomise me you won &apos;t tell him , stefan .
i promise .
there was a time when i trusted him more than anyone .
trust breeds trust .
you have to give it get it .
are you lecturing me ?
do you need to be lectured ?
i just want her back .
i &apos;m sure you can understand that .
i can understand that you would do anything for her , yes .
then you understand what i will do
if anyone gets in my way .
you said you never played this thing before .
i &apos;m a fast learner . quick reflexes .
who are you dodging ?
this girl anna .
she can be , uh , persistent .
is she hot ?
yeahyeah , but she can be weird .
hot trumps weird , trust me .
he is ridiculously hot !
he &apos;s an ass .
what are you doing with all this stuff ?
i thought there might be something
about my birth parents .
have you told jeremy ?
i will .
when the time is right .
that &apos;s stefan .
dude !
well ?
admit it .
i can &apos;t sing .
no . you were great .
come on , totally trashed a metallica song .
well , first mistake , metallica karaoke ?
well , at least i could admit it .
the woman with the tattoos loved you .
yeah , well , next time ,
i &apos;m going to throw out my pearl jam .
next time ?
yeah .
so , uh ,
what are your friends up to tonight ?
they &apos;re all doing their own thing .
caroline &apos;s at her dad &apos;s , elena &apos;s with her boyfriend .
elena gilbert , right ?
yeah , i remember . you guys used to hang out .
she &apos;s my best friend .
yeah , my friends , they all moved away after graduation ,
and i didn &apos;t .
so we just kind of drifted apart .
oh . elena and i are bonded for life .
i can &apos;t imagine it either way .
that tight , huh ?
she &apos;s my sister . i mean , i &apos;d die for her .
who took it ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know what , it &apos;s that teacher .
there &apos;s something really off about him .
no , he doesn &apos;t know anything .
somebody got to him right before me .
who else knew it was there ?
no . damon , leave him out of it !
why , what &apos;s the big deal ?
damon !
so ...
i heard you found a really cool journal
from back in the day .
who else did you show it to ? huh ?
don &apos;t ask questions , just spill .
u &apos;re kidding me , right ?
jer , did you tell anyone other than alaric saltzman
about jonathan gilbert &apos;s journal ?
why is everybody so obsessed with that thing ?
who else did you tell ?
just that girl snna .
the hot weird one ?
yeah .
wait , who is anna ?
that &apos;s what i want to find out .
how do you know her ?
i just know her .
she wants me to meet her at the grill tonight .
perfect . i &apos;ll drive .
come on .
ok .
ok , i &apos;m alone .
give me all the deets , bonnie . i &apos;m dying .
it &apos;s going great . he &apos;s a perfect gentleman .
gentleman , huh ?
i know !
boring , huh ? i just want to grab him and lay one on him .
why don &apos;t you ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m a chicken .
you &apos;re a powerful witch goddess .
come on , seize the day , broom hilda .
ok .
i &apos;m going to text you later with more details .
you better .
where &apos;s damon ?
he left to track down jeremy &apos;s friend anna ,
see if there was anything there .
aren &apos;t you going to go with him ?
if he gets to the journal before we do , then ...
doesn &apos;t matter .
what is that ? it &apos;s a copy of it .
how did you get it ?
well , mr. saltzman made a copy
and was kind enough to loan it to me .
he did ?
not exactly , but i got it .
you just couldn &apos;t live without me , huh
well , i kinda miss my daily dose of cute stalker chick .
oh , funny .
let &apos;s play .
the sheriff was here earlier .
he bought large volumes of the vervain elixir .
didn &apos;t he try to put his hands on you again ?
doesn &apos;t he always ?
she &apos;s saving herself for jonathan gilbert .
i &apos;m beyond saving . we know that .
how can you be so calm ?
they &apos;re getting closer to you every day .
we are the respectable ladies of mystic falls .
thanks to emily , we walk the streets in daylight .
no one will ever suspect us .
not unless a human tells them .
i &apos;d sooner die .
and soon enough , you will .
mrs. fell is approaching .
thank you , annabelle .
here &apos;s a reference that he wrote about emily .
&quot; the fell family believed it should be i ,
&quot; not them , who protected the witch &apos;s spell book .
but i feared she would haunt me from the here after .
they mocked my fear ,
but it was giuseppe salvatore who-- &quot;
is that your father ?
yeah .
&quot; it was giuseppe salvatore who removed my fear .
&quot; he told me he would protect the secret of the spell book .
he said he would carry it to his grave . &quot;
stefan .
to what do i owe this pleasure ?
did i interrupt your writing ?
these are the dull musings of my troubled mind .
a great mind .
still . i will carry the real secrets with me--
to your grave .
and a full grave it will be .
now , speaking of troubled minds ,
what &apos;s on yours ?
i have concerns about your plan for the vampires .
and why is that ?
we are making the sumption that all vampires
are as evil as they &apos;ve been characterized ,
but what if that &apos;s not true ?
do you have any evidence to the contrary ?
do you know of any vampires ?
no . no , of course not .
but are we to take what others say at face value ?
you always taught us so differently .
stefan ...
these creatures are of the dark parts of hell .
they have the ability to control your mind ,
seduce your spirit .
they are deadly .
they must be destroyed .
those who stand with them , those who bring shame to
their families will be destroyed as well .
i know where it is .
ok , i give .
damn .
you &apos;re strong for a little thing .
i was wondering how long it would take you to find me .
why isn &apos;t your father buried in your family &apos;s tomb ?
it wasn &apos;t built until well after he died .
are you sure the grimoire &apos;s in there with him ?
as sure as i could be .
great .
elena .
i can do this on my own .
and i said i would do whatever i can to help .
i know , and i appreciate that , but--
this town is my home , stefan .
my friends and family are here . you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t want that tomb opened any more than you do .
i &apos;m sorry that you have to do this .
what is that ?
a gift .
from damon ?
from emily , actually .
and when will you stop worrying about damon ?
i want you all to myself .
just as he wants me ,
but i &apos;m the one who gets to make all the rules .
and why is that ?
because i &apos;m spoiled .
yes , you are .
and selfish .
and because i can do this .
and this .
and this .
what ?
what ?
vervain .
what ?
katherine ! katherine !
go get the sheriff . tell him we have a vampire .
what ? no !
do as i say , son !
nothing that you feel for her is real .
she &apos;s a vampire , stefan ! a monster !
i fed you vervain hoping that it would expose her .
how did you know ?
your sympathy for their plight .
i didn &apos;t raise my sons to be so weak .
the sheriff , now . go , quickly !
now , son !
how long have you been here ?
i arrived around half @-@ past comet ,
watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb .
how did you know about the spell ?
i didn &apos;t say much back then ,
which means i heard everything .
so if you &apos;ve been here the whole time ,
then why are we just crossing paths right now ?
i like to use others to do my dirty work .
like logan fell ?
oh , yeah , thanks for that , by the way .
little bastard shot me .
logan was an idiot .
we slipped him some blood when he started getting
all poser slayer with that comps .
i needed his family &apos;s journal . i couldn &apos;t let him die .
what &apos;d you want with the fell journal ?
i thought it contained the location
of the witch &apos;s spell book .
i was wrong .
according to her journal , honorea gave the grimoire
to jonathan gilbert .
and , according to this ...
he gave it to your father .
so now you &apos;re going to help me find it .
why would i help you ?
&apos;cause you and i both want that tomb open .
sorry .
i work alone .
well the check &apos;s paid .
i &apos;m all yours tonight . what do you want to do ?
this .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . sorry .
i just should have waited until the end of the night to do that .
i didn &apos;t mind .
you know , i &apos;m starting to get tired .
do you want go ?
i was going to say let &apos;s have some more coffee ,
get a caffeine buzz , and , i don &apos;t know ,
go out , do something crazy .
hmm , like what ?
like anything .
ok .
i &apos;m going to run to the restroom .
ok .
all right .
what ?
not many girls can say they &apos;ve done this .
is that it ?
well , what do you know ?
this is an interesting turn of events .
i can &apos;t let you bring her back .
i &apos;m sorry .
so am i.
for thinking for even a second
that i can trust you .
oh . you &apos;re not capable of trust .
the fact that you &apos;re here means that you read the journal
and you were planning on doing this yourself .
of course i was going to do it by myself ,
because the only one i can count on is me !
you made sure of that many years ago , stefan .
but you ...
you had me fooled .
so what are you going to do now ?
because if you try and destroy that ,
i &apos;ll rip her heart out .
you won &apos;t kill her .
i can do one better .
give me the book , stefan .
or i &apos;m stabbing her neck .
and you and i will have a vampire girlfriend .
let her go first .
the book .
i &apos;m not going to give this to you
until she is standing next to me .
problem is , i no longer trust
that you &apos;ll give it back !
you just did the one thing that ensures that i will .
stop ! no don &apos;t take her !
do you know what they &apos;ll do to you
if you &apos;re branded a sympathizer ?
you &apos;ll be killed along with them !
just let me be killed !
aspinrins must be downstairs .
my head supposed to hurt like this ?
oh , you &apos;ll be fine . that was just
a small amount of blood .
it should pass out of your system by tomorrow .
are you ok ?
damon was right . this is , uh ...
this is my fault .
damon !
damon ! stop , stop .
i &apos;ll help you .
we &apos;ll get her back .
help me ? !
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve done enough ?
you promised you wouldn &apos;t tell him !
i didn &apos;t think this would happen .
you did this .
this is your fault .
i put my faith in my father ,
but damon put his faith in me ,
and i destroyed that .
this is my fault .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
don &apos;t forget that .
i &apos;m going to get you that aspirin .
ok .
you know you &apos;re not staying the night , right ?
we &apos;re just going to hang out
for a little while .
you &apos;re lucky i like you .
keep the door open .
you got it .
hey , do you have any aspirin
oh , hey , stefan .
where &apos;d she go ?
she went to the bathroom .
where &apos;d who go ?
he has a friend over .
anna .
what &apos;s happening ?
get emily .
stay hidden .
i &apos;ll get us out of here .
pearl !
jonathan !
do you see all this ?
the town &apos;s gone mad running after the demons .
you !
jonathan ... please .
i beg you !
i &apos;ve got another one over here !
mother ! shh , shh !
this way !
shh !
it &apos;ll be all right .
you &apos;re going to see her again .
i will protect them .
i &apos;m going to protect them .
