well , i &apos;m off .
while i do love our tradition
of still getting together on saturday for thanksgiving leftovers ,
maybe next time we can order a turkey
that doesn &apos;t have its own event horizon .
oh , well , who cares ?
i know it &apos;s totally gonna slay them
in my astrophysics club .
first time anyone in that club gets slayed .
let me give you a hug goodbye .
i cannot believe that you &apos;re already going to college .
it seems like yesterday when you were a little girl
reading at college level .
check you out !
thanks .
i have a hot study partner coming over , so --
what are you making , my little chef ?
i &apos;m making pasghetti !
you are adorable .
i remember when i had everyone in the palm of my hand
with a two @-@ foot putt like &quot; pasghetti . &quot;
we both know you know how to say it .
hey , guys , thanks again for helping me to get that listing .
cyril &apos;s house .
pretty sexy , huh ?
ridonk .
this place makes the playboy mansion
look like an old folks &apos; home .
which i guess it kind of is now .
infinity pool , killer views ,
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art game room , home theater ...
plus that four @-@ person shower .
did you know that &apos;s where cyril met his new husband ?
even the security code &apos;s sexy .
literally . it spells out &quot; sexy &quot; on the keypad .
even i think that &apos;s trying too hard ,
and at this point , i &apos;m mostly body spray .
and that master bathtub alone has been in four rap videos
plus a murder re @-@ creation on a &quot; dateline &quot; special
called &quot; rub @-@ a @-@ dub dead . &quot;
when i was younger ,
i was a little embarrassed
my dad was just a real @-@ estate agent .
but as i got older , i realized ,
hey , he may not have the coolest job in the world ,
but he puts food on the table
and has access to a bunch of empty houses
i can sneak into . &quot;
wow . nice pool at the three @-@ bedroom in hillgrove .
well , looky here ,
one of my kids showing interest in the family biz .
oh , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m smart enough for that .
you have to remember so much stuff ,
like when anyone &apos;s gonna be there .
that &apos;s what the datebook &apos;s for .
plus you have to remember
all of those lock @-@ box combinations .
i just use a very special birthday .
houdini &apos;s .
i left my watch by cyril &apos;s tub .
i &apos;m usually extra careful not to leave any trace
that i was at one of my dad &apos;s houses ,
but this tub has 16 pulsating jets ,
and the whole floor vibrates
with something called &quot; swedish release . &quot;
it took me 20 minutes to find my car in the driveway .
i &apos;m so sorry , grandpa .
i have to go do this thing for work .
thanks .
hold on .
no one leaves this house without a bag of meat .
bye , honey .
can you believe how conscientious
our little girl has become ?
racing off to work on a saturday .
there &apos;s a 30 % chance she thinks it &apos;s friday ,
but still .
are you still mad at me ?
i lost my cool on phil last night .
but in my defense , i had been traveling all day ,
and we had different ideas
about how we were gonna spend the evening .
get in here right now .
get in this tub , you dirty girl .
oh , honey , that is so sweet ,
but i &apos;ve been up since 5 : 00 a.m.
don &apos;t overthink it , babe . just take the plunge .
oh , good , you &apos;re back .
could you grab the underwater camera ?
you &apos;re bathing with them now ?
they waddled into the garage and got oil on them .
and then when they were in here by themselves ,
all they wanted to do was horse around , so ...
i spent the morning in berkeley
and the afternoon in portland .
i deserve to feel clean again .
but now the nice , soothing tub
that i &apos;ve been dreaming about all day
is filled with feathers and motor oil and probably bird flu .
so , no . no . you just sit tight ,
and i will use the hose in the backyard .
could you still grab the camera ?
okay . i was harsh .
but the flight back from portland was rough .
the overheads were packed with foldable bikes ,
and i was sitting next to a guy using a typewriter .
still , phil is really holding on to this one .
well , phil &apos;s mad at me .
come here , little girl .
let me give you a hug .
you &apos;re not shy with those hugs today , are you ?
oh , and come here .
oh , me too ?
i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but i get so emotional around the holidays .
oh , god .
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
mr. dunphy ? is that you ?
haley ?
andy , wh-- uh , what are you doing here ?
setting up for an open house tomorrow .
what are you d--
splish , splash , who was taking a bath ? !
me .
i snuck over last night , but the faucet leaked ,
and i guess i was so mellowed out
i forgot to drain the tub .
that &apos;s pretty darn mellowed out .
were you burning incense ?
uh , yep . sure was . okay .
well , i &apos;ll lay some towels down . you drain the tub .
is it stuck ?
no , i &apos;m checking my makeup in the reflection .
yes , it &apos;s stuck .
here . let me help .
no , no . i can get it .
here . okay .
oh , my god .
relax , i &apos;m okay .
no . isn &apos;t this the tub from the lil wayne video ?
i put our clothes in the dryer .
i made an executive decision --
went with the irish mountain dryer sheets .
what does an irish mountain smell like ?
we &apos;ll find out in 30 , 35 minutes .
hey , uh , don &apos;t tell my dad i was here , okay ?
i suppose i could do you that wee favor .
do me a second favor ...
yeah , i don &apos;t love it , either .
hey , why were you
taking a bath over here , anyway ?
oh , i just wanted a few hours to myself .
you know , i live in my parents &apos; basement ,
i broke up with dylan ,
i was depressed about how much i ate at thanksgiving ...
you broke up with dylan , huh ?
yeah . actually , it was the day
that we saw you and beth at that movie .
you guys seemed so great together
i guess i just thought , &quot; i want that . &quot;
i am pretty lucky .
but for what it &apos;s worth ,
beth and i are not perfect .
things come up when you plan a wedding .
really ? there &apos;s such a thing as mormon drama ?
there was when beth &apos;s uncle found out
we &apos;re serving coffee at the reception .
plus , she doesn &apos;t want me to have a bachelor party .
at all ?
it is one night before the rest of your life .
you should do it up .
that &apos;s what i said .
well , to my mirror , but you &apos;re right .
i deserve one adventure before i settle down .
look what you did . here .
well , yeah , i mean , you got to do something fun .
um ... maybe you try and fix it .
yeah . it should be simple enough .
o ... kay ... i did not mean to do that .
um , maybe try this one ?
maybe we shouldn &apos;t touch any more buttons .
right .
uh ... what were we talking about ?
having an adventure .
oh , god , is that my dad ?
&apos;tis a fine kettle of fish we &apos;re in !
get in the laundry room !
and sad news from the zoo ,
chuffa the panda has suffered a m--
stop touching stuff !
well , you &apos;re not shy with those hugs today , are you ?
i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but i get so emotional around the holidays .
oh , i get it .
i really do .
i love you .
i love you too .
gloria .
so , this year ,
we &apos;re surprising the family with a trip to miami .
the travel company needs everybody &apos;s driver &apos;s license
to book the flight .
that &apos;s where &quot; sticky fingers &quot; here
comes in handy .
everybody has a bad cousin
that teaches you a few things .
like how to smoke , how to pick @-@ pocket ,
how to hot @-@ wire a car ,
how to put tacks on your shoe
when you want to throw off a @-@ a lie @-@ detector test .
which cousin was this ?
i am the cousin .
bye .
phil , honey , remember those gutter covers
that we ordered like a year ago ?
good news .
they shipped !
that &apos;s exciting .
please kill me if i ever find gutter covers exciting .
i know . that marriage is staler
than a box of cupcakes at a supermodel retreat .
oh , hay , phil !
thank you again for coming !
it was our pleasure . you &apos;re always so ...
generous to have us !
ay , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t wanted to tickle you .
it &apos;s just that i love how this fabric feel .
what is the name of this material ?
uh ... jeans .
oh , and they feel so tight , huh ?
oh , a little holiday trick .
keeps me from eating too much .
i think you &apos;re too tense .
what the hell is going --
hey , hon .
yeah ?
we didn &apos;t get much of a chance to talk today .
how are you ?
not great .
but , honestly , i don &apos;t want to bore you .
oh , well , at least start the story .
okay . um , well , i got back from portland ,
and phil was in the bathtub with all the ducks ,
and i just completely lost it .
and , yes , i &apos;ve apologized ...
but he &apos;s really not letting go of it this time .
i -- you &apos;re so strong !
work &apos;s taking up a lot of your time , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re taking his side on this ?
i &apos;ve been you on this .
when i was bogged down with work ,
your mother and i fought all the time .
i mean , maybe not about ducks . i &apos;m not a weirdo .
but maybe he &apos;s mad at you because you &apos;re not around .
but i only took like two trips .
just &apos; cause you &apos;re around doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re around .
that &apos;s one of those loopy things mom would say .
i used to pretend that i didn &apos;t understand it , too ,
but i did .
why not just make some time for each other ?
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;ll take him for a weekend up north , huh ?
what do you think ?
sure .
yeah . or leave him .
you &apos;re still attractive . worked great for me .
i am still in shock about
the deal we got on those ice @-@ cube trays .
i know . it &apos;s like we pulled off the great tray robbery .
you know , it says we &apos;re supposed to
throw them in the dishwasher ,
but i &apos;m just gonna give them a rinse .
oh , you are so bad !
you know , since we got all of our errands done early
and we do have a little extra time on our hands ...
and lily &apos;s at a sleepover .
just -- right there . a little to the right .
right -- yeah . perfect . now turn .
i have been wanting to flip that mattress for months .
i know . it feels good to get stuff done .
yeah , it does !
yes !
so , other than lily ,
we have no real reason to be alive , right ?
oh , god , is that my dad ?
get in the laundry room !
and sad news from the zoo ,
chuffa the panda has suffered a m--
stop touching stuff !
are you sure we should be doing this ?
mitchell , we just high @-@ fived over flipping a mattress .
that &apos;s way sadder than phil and claire &apos;s gutter covers .
plus , cyril won &apos;t care .
it &apos;s not like he hasn &apos;t had his fun in our place .
what ? when ?
at your birthday party .
he and gregory were in the bathroom for like an hour .
oh , no . that &apos;s &apos; cause gregory lost a contact lens .
okay , you &apos;re adorable .
all right , now , i &apos;m gonna go make some cocktails ,
and then when that sun goes down ...
you and i can get cozy in the hot tub , okay ?
ohh , i like the sound of that .
i &apos;m gonna put on some mood music , huh ?
hey , cam , don &apos;t they have a remote
that controls everything ?
yeah , i think so .
you know where he keeps that ?
well , ours is always getting buried in the couch .
oh , here it is .
ooh , i like this song .
would you like a show to go with it ?
mitchell !
who &apos;s mitchell ?
i &apos;m magic mitch .
welder by day ...
stripper by choice .
my unwed sister is seven months pregnant .
my mother has some uterine issues
not covered by medicare .
but if you want to make it rain , i will --
mitchell ! sweetie , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
how &apos;s the lamp ? is it okay ? does it work ?
it &apos;s fine . see ?
okay .
all right , now , come on . let &apos;s get back on track .
yes .
i &apos;ll go get the cocktails .
you make yourself comfortable .
i sure will .
maybe something a little more lively ?
it &apos;s not &quot; adam and steve , &quot; damn it .
corpses as far as the eye can see .
what you don &apos;t know about your ice @-@ cube tray
could kill you .
maybe the first station .
oh , what &apos;s happening ?
geez .
don &apos;t worry about claire .
you &apos;ve got me all afternoon .
honey , remember those gutter covers
that we ordered like a year ago ?
good news . they shipped !
that &apos;s exciting .
claire &apos;s been working a lot lately ,
and it &apos;s been ... great .
it &apos;s given me a lot more time for &quot; battle beasts of gar , &quot;
this massive online role @-@ playing game .
and with cyril &apos;s state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art gaming system ,
i &apos;ve been able to take my half @-@ dwarf , half @-@ ox fire mage --
pyrominiyak --
to a whole new level .
level three !
our guild , thugsquad ,
has been trying to plan a raid against our arch @-@ rival guild ,
led by the ruthless sexybeast ,
and i got a text saying it was finally happening .
that is , if i could get claire
to be okay with me disappearing for a few hours .
phil , honey , i want to apologize .
for what ? you haven &apos;t -
been around at all . i know .
i know , and i want to make it up to you .
it was very hurtful .
yeah . it &apos;s just sometimes i get so caught up in work
that even when i am around , i &apos;m not around .
so well put .
i don &apos;t want to beat you up about that .
it &apos;s healing time now .
you know , what i &apos;d love
is a few hours at cyril &apos;s house this afternoon .
with me ?
actually ...
i was thinking about that
role @-@ playing thing i &apos;m into ?
phil and i have , on occasion ,
adopted various alter @-@ egos to spice up our marriage .
cyril &apos;s house does sound
kind of perfect for some romance .
and i like that phil wants to move past this , so ...
did you have a particular genre in mind
for this afternoon &apos;s game ?
yes . medieval fantasy .
great .
thank you .
oh , sexybeast , you are gonna get so spanked .
refrigerator .
no , say &quot; fridger @-@ frater . &quot;
but it &apos;s refrigerator .
i need you to focus , kid .
fridger @-@ frater -- where we keep the sammiches .
people seem delighted by joe . whatever .
but i had that fetching study partner coming over ,
and i realized i could use joe &apos;s by @-@ the @-@ numbers cuteness
to my amorous advantage .
even for me , that was a lot of manny .
but it &apos;s sandwich .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re not even trying .
okay , that &apos;s probably her .
l @-@ look , just be cute , okay ? for my sake .
it &apos;s like when guys use puppies to attract girls .
hi , manny .
uh , olive . please come in .
that &apos;s my little brother , joe .
don &apos;t mind his little pot there .
hey , what do you have in there again ?
some kind of pasta dish ?
are you a doggie ?
yeah , he &apos;s always doing adorable stuff like that
&apos;cause i &apos;m his hero .
i love that .
are you a good doggie or a bad doggie ?
oh , scary !
adorable .
i know .
uh , so should we head up ?
oh , my god ! get it off me !
uh ... no ! joe ! joe !
joe , let go !
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s biting me ! do something !
no ! bad joe !
bad joe !
that &apos;s just making him bite me harder !
a person is not a sammich , joe !
joe , what are you doing ?
joe , let go !
did you know phil was gonna be here ?
no . i @-@ i wear a t @-@ shirt in the pool .
do you think i want him to see me in the middle of this ?
go . go .
well , we only have one six @-@ pack .
so , in a way , it &apos;s good all the girls said no .
what are you doing here ?
oh , um , my s.a.t. prep group
needed a quiet place to study .
you ain &apos;t studying acting .
okay . we don &apos;t have time for this .

to make it to his oboe lesson !
and i thought my dad was embarrassing .
shut up .
okay , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
hello ?
is anybody here ?
drop it !
ohh , gettin &apos; right to it .
i like it .
please , sir , have pity .
it &apos;s true i &apos;m just a common thief ,
but if you have mercy ,
i &apos;ll make it worth your while -- - oh , yes .
what medieval creature is this ?
half @-@ man , half @-@ robot ... welder ?
if you come out now , you simpering coward ,
maybe i &apos;ll show you a little mercy .
please don &apos;t hurt me ! it was her idea !
i &apos;m the one who wanted to go slow !
reuben ?
oh , alex !
claire ?
reuben again ?
he wore a batman cape to the first day of high school !
you &apos;re really judging me right now
when you look like a hooker at comic @-@ con ?

and i will be getting my coat ...
claire ,

luke ?

mrs. dunphy , do you ever tutor ?
dude !
i &apos;m just gonna grab my razor scooter and bounce .
happy birth--
happy birth--
no , you know it &apos;s no one &apos;s birthday .
you &apos;re probably here for the same reason as those two .
well , technically , this is your fault ,
because we were afraid our marriage
was getting as boring as yours .
though based on her outfit ,
we need to work a little harder .
you should all be ashamed of yourselves .
i &apos;m the only one authorized to be here .
by sneaking in , you &apos;ve disrespected me ,
and violated the trust between me , my clients ,
and this sexy , sexy house .
no . no !
great . now lisa &apos;s dead .
i want everybody out of here right now !
well , at least we have our house to ourselves still .
does magic mitch have another set him in ?
yeah . his grandma &apos;s built @-@ up shoe isn &apos;t gonna pay for itself .
okay , we need to work on your sexy patter .
off the lamp . off the lamp .
okay , before you get any stupid ideas ,
reuben and i broke in here
so i could help him with his math .
good luck getting through to that guy .
he &apos;s clueless .
honey .
yes ?
i &apos;m sorry . that -- that little outburst
was mainly directed at them .
whatever misunderstanding led to this ,
i &apos;m ... happy about .
i thought you were upset
because we hadn &apos;t spent any time together .
and then you said you wanted some role @-@ playing fun ...
really ?
honey , i know you &apos;ve been working really hard lately ,
and i @-@ i appreciate any time i can get with you .
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
silence , elvin harlot .
ohh , sorry , my lord .
didn &apos;t mean to offend .
but you have , craven wench .
and i shall mete out punishment as --
i can hear you guys giggling .
at least i have a girlfriend !
all clear .
well , that was crazy .
my ticker hasn &apos;t gotten a workout that good
since i made the finals of that cup @-@ stacking competition .
hey , should i take these robes upstairs ?
i &apos;m gonna pop mine in the washer .
i &apos;ve got about three pounds of tension sweat in here .
i , uh ...
i feel kind of bad about before .
don &apos;t . we didn &apos;t do anything .
i know . it just felt like something could &apos;ve ...
if everybody hadn &apos;t ...
yeah .
you know what it is .
it &apos;s the house .
it &apos;s the house !
i mean , the fireplace , the music ...
the crazy couch @-@ bed .
anyone could &apos;ve gotten swept up .
anyone .
anyone . yeah .
well , i should get going .
yeah . totally .
i mean , it was a fun afternoon , though .
i wanted one crazy adventure before i got married ,
and i got one .
good . it was fun .
i &apos;ll see you later .
yep .
what &apos;s joe doing in stella &apos;s cage ?
he knows what he did .
go on , boy ! get !
jay !
so , i was thinking ,
since miami &apos;s only a few hours away from colombia ,
why don &apos;t we have my relatives fly to miami
so that the whole family can be together ?
gloria , i love your family . i do .
but -- - this is so typical .
we do everything for your family ,
but when it comes to my side of the family , then --
we &apos;re not going to miami .
what ?
i bought everybody plane tickets to colombia .
ay , jay !
that &apos;s not what you were supposed to do !
i think you mean &quot; you shouldn &apos;t have , &quot;
and you &apos;re probably right .
no ! i mean you shouldn &apos;t have been nice about this at all !
you were supposed to say ,
&quot; why can &apos;t we see your family some other time ? &quot;
and i would say , &quot; like when ? &quot;
and then you would say , &quot; is never an option ? &quot;
and i would say , &quot; that &apos;s so mean , jay pritchett ! &quot;
and then you would say ,
&quot; is there a way that i can make it up to you , gloria ? &quot;
and then i would say , &quot; how about if ... &quot;
if what ?
oh , no .
hola ! hola ! hola !
yeah . come in , come in .
does this feel like a short visit to you or a long one ?
the pregnant one brought a stroller .
