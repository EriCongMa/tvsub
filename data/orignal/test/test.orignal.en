did everything go okay with the annulment ? 
no problems . it &apos;s all taken care of . 
Ross , thank you . 
do you want to go see a movie ? yeah , why not ? 
I &apos;ll get my sweater . 
do you want to hear something weird ? 
always . 
I didn &apos;t get the annulment . 
what ? we &apos;re still married . 
don &apos;t tell Rachel . see you later . 
do you have any gum ? 
wait ! wait ! Ross , can I just talk to you for just a second ? 
we &apos;ll be late for the movie . 
there &apos;s a cab . taxi ! 
that &apos;s great . my God , huh ? 
there you go . 
we &apos;re gonna walk . it &apos;s right at the Angelika . 
the Angelika ! go ! go ! 
you didn &apos;t get the annulment ? ! 
I know . 
Ross ? 
I tried , but when I got to my lawyer &apos;s office , all I heard was : 
&quot; three divorces ! three divorces ! &quot; 
yes , in that high voice . 
I just don &apos;t want my tombstone to read : &quot; Ross Geller : three divorces . &quot; 
don &apos;t worry about that . your tombstone can say whatever you want . 
it can say , &quot; Ross Geller : good at Marriage . &quot; 
you know ? mine &apos;s gonna say , &quot; Phoebe Buffay : buried Alive . &quot; 
all I know is , I can &apos;t have another failed marriage . 
so you &apos;re gonna be married to a girl who doesn &apos;t even know about it ? 
woman . sorry . 
okay , so I don &apos;t have it all worked out quite yet . just don &apos;t say anything to Rachel . 
Rachel is one of my closest friends . 
but being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special . okay . 
okay , stop , stop ! 
Phoebe ? hey , Rach ! 
what was that ? sorry . mix-up . 
how was the movie ? I haven &apos;t seen it yet . 
you &apos;d better hurry . the Angelika ! go ! 
no 
the One Where Ross Hugs Rachel 
when I move in , can I get a gumball machine ? 
of course . Joey wouldn &apos;t let you have one ? 
no , when it comes to sweets , he &apos;s surprisingly strict . 
did you tell him you &apos;re moving out ? no , I keep trying . 
and I can get out , &quot; Joey , I have to .. &quot; 
then I lose my nerve and I finish with , &quot; go to the bathroom . &quot; 
he may think I &apos;m sick . 
I have to tell Rachel , but .... 
we just gotta get it over with . 
next time we see them , we &apos;ll just tell them . 
that &apos;s it . 
that &apos;s how it &apos;ll work now ? you &apos;ll just order me around ? 
pretty much . 
all right . 
Monica 
hey , man , you feeling better ? 
we have something to tell you . 
Oh , my God ! you &apos;re pregnant ! 
no ! 
no ? no ! 
look , Joe , here &apos;s the thing . 
Monica and I have decided to live together , here . I &apos;m gonna be moving out , man . 
I &apos;m really happy for you guys . congratulations . see you later . 
are you okay ? 
I gotta go . I &apos;ve got an acting job . 
like you &apos;d believe that . 
this sucks ! 
I &apos;ll be across the hall . and I promise you ... 
the minute Monica and I break up , I &apos;m moving right back in . 
maybe that &apos;s now . 
if you &apos;re gonna move in with him ... I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him . 
he &apos;s a terrible roommate . terrible . 
he forgets to .... He always , he always .... 
who am I kidding ? he &apos;s the best roommate ! 
hey , Phoebe . 
Oh , look , here &apos;s an article about people who marry people and don &apos;t tell them . 
really ? 
yeah , I &apos;m reading Ross Geller Magazine . 
have you seen Rachel ? 
no , why ? 
I have some exciting news . 
you &apos;re pregnant . 
no ! Chandler and I are moving in together.Oh , that &apos;s good ! 
but if you were pregnant , what would you name it ? hint , Phoebe . 
what &apos;s up ? 
Chandler and I are moving in together . 
Oh , my God.Oh , my little sister and my best friend ... shacking up . 
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great . 
guys , I &apos;m happy too.Okay , come here . 
big day , huh ? people moving in . people getting annulled . 
I gotta go find Rachel . 
if you see her , give her some really bad news , so mine doesn &apos;t seem so bad . 
something bad to tell Rachel . 
bad news for Rachel . what could that be ? 
can you just lay off , please ? 
my life is an embarrassment . I should just go live under somebody &apos;s stairs . 
it &apos;s not that big a deal . 
you &apos;ll have been divorced three times.You &apos;ll have a life , you &apos;ll date .. 
no , I won &apos;t . I &apos;ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now . 
the only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy ... Murderer Guy 
and geologists . 
Ross , you &apos;re being ridiculous . you are cute and smart and sweet . 
that is much more important than three stupid divorces . 
have you dated anyone who &apos;s been divorced three times ? 
that &apos;s not fair . most guys that have been divorced three times are 60 . 
you &apos;re young . 
that &apos;s true , I am young . 
well .... 
nobody cares about this except you.This embarrassment thing is all in your head . 
here , I &apos;ll show you . 
come here . 
what ? 
hi . my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.But wouldn &apos;t you date him ? 
and if you wait right here , I &apos;ll go get Ross . 
I thought you were Rachel.What gave me away ? 
I gotta tell her . 
I told Ross and Phoebe . she &apos;s the only one left . 
it &apos;s official . we &apos;re moving in together.No turning back . 
are you scared ? are you ? ! 
I &apos;m not . 
that was my scariest voice . you &apos;re brave . 
the worst day . 
you &apos;re finally making progress at work , then your boss calls you Racquel . 
listen , for the first four years of my work , everybody called me Sha-la-lap 
seriously . 
I believe you . 
it was in the middle of a meeting , so no one wants to correct her . 
so everyone &apos;s calling me Racquel . 
by the end of the day , the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky . 
well , I still think you &apos;re very , very nice and very pretty . 
what ? 
all yours , babe . 
have a seat . 
listen to me , Chandler and I ... are going to live together ... Here . 
Oh , my God.That &apos;s so great ! 
I &apos;m so happy for you guys ! 
really ? 
and that was so sweet of you to ask me . 
the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together ! 
yes , we are . 
Chandler , you &apos;ll have to watch those long showers you take ... because you know Racquel can &apos;t be late . 
he &apos;ll work on that . 
this is so exciting ! 
come and knock on our door 
we &apos;ll be waiting for you 
once you know the stories , it &apos;s not that bad . 
my first marriage : my wife &apos;s hidden her sexuality . it &apos;s not my fault . 
my second marriage : I said the wrong name at the altar . it &apos;s a little my fault . 
my third marriage : 
they shouldn &apos;t let you get married ... when you &apos;re drunk and have writing on your face . it &apos;s Nevada &apos;s fault . 
so what do you think ? who wouldn &apos;t want to date him ? 
the divorces don &apos;t bother me . I &apos;d date him.But not while he &apos;s still married . 
and you , wouldn &apos;t you want to date ? 
I &apos;m not dating at all anymore . 
I was only dating guys that were bad for me . 
so I decided that .. Good . good . whatever . 
and you , Meg ? 
well , I don &apos;t care about the divorces , either.But I wouldn &apos;t date him . 
normally , he doesn &apos;t sweat this much . 
it &apos;s just that he &apos;s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.What ? 
she said , &quot; He &apos;s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl . &quot; 
this is crazy . I mean , yes , Rachel is my good friend . 
and I have loved her in the past ... but now , she is just my wife . 
Phoebe , will you help me out here ? 
well , I thought you loved her when you married her . 
we were drunk ! I would &apos;ve married Joey with that amount of alcohol . 
you could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani ! 
I &apos;m sorry , but you guys are wrong.I just don &apos;t want to be divorced three times . 
now he &apos;s using this three-divorces reason ... because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her . 
I must say , well done . Bravo , Meg . 
fine . if this is what you think , forget about ... the whole three-divorce thing . 
I &apos;ll go to my lawyer &apos;s office right now and get this marriage annulled . 
she means nothing to me.Nothing ! 
okay , now I wouldn &apos;t date you because you seem a little creepy . 
I am so attracted to him right now . 
when will we tell Rachel what actually will happen ? 
Soon.I just couldn &apos;t before . you saw how upset Joey got . 
I couldn &apos;t do it . she &apos;s my best friend . 
Joey &apos;s my best friend . 
I &apos;m not your best friend ? 
you just said .. 
of course you &apos;re my best friend . 
would you tell Rachel ? 
all right . at least I &apos;m prepared . 
Oh , yes . 
they &apos;re not for you . are you upset ? 
I am now . 
hey , roomie.Okay , bye . 
there &apos;s something important I have to tell you . 
are you pregnant ? 
no , but I &apos;m throwing this shirt away . 
I think there was a little misunderstanding before . 
when I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together ... 
we meant alone together . 
Oh , my God . that &apos;s funny . I can &apos;t believe I did that . 
no , sweetie . you know what ? this is my fault.I wasn &apos;t clear.I &apos;m really sorry . 
listen , you take as much time as you need to move out , okay ? there &apos;s absolutely no rush . 
okay . 
okay 
don &apos;t you want a cookie ? 
sure . 
Thanks.Do you need a tissue ? 
where did you get these ? 
I made them . 
Oh , My God , they &apos;re so yummy ! 
okay , whose is this ? 
that &apos;s mine . 
and what about this ? whose is this ? 
that &apos;s mine . 
okay , whose dishwashing soap is this ? 
that was here when we moved in . 
Oh , I guess it really is concentrated . 
it &apos;s gonna be weird when I come home and you &apos;re not here . 
no more Joey and Chan &apos;s.No more J and C &apos;s . 
do you want to go to Joey and Chandler &apos;s ? 
I can &apos;t . it &apos;s not there . 
I &apos;ll be across the hall . we can still do all the same stuff . 
we won &apos;t be able to have those long talks at night ... about our feelings and the future . 
not once did we do that . 
don &apos;t you remember that night , it was late and I was feeling sick ... 
and you said I would feel better tomorrow ? 
Oh , yeah . I remember that . 
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m just gonna miss living with you.Yeah , me too , man . 
what the hell is that ? 
that &apos;s disgusting . 
I told Rachel that it &apos;s just gonna be the two of us.Oh , yeah ? well , how &apos;d she take it ? 
really well.Surprisingly well . 
she didn &apos;t cry . she wasn &apos;t angry or sad . 
and you &apos;re upset because you didn &apos;t make your best friend cry ? 
all I &apos;m asking for is a little emotion.Is that too much to ask after six years ? 
what , are Rachel and I not as close as you guys ? 
I mean , did we not have as much fun ? 
don &apos;t I deserve a few tears ? 
when we told Joey , he cried his eyes out . 
I did not cry my eyes out ! 
come on , it &apos;s like the end of an era.No more J-Man and Channy &apos;s ! 
okay , I gotta ask , who calls us that ? 
you got married again ? 
yes . 
so that &apos;s your second marriage in two years ? 
yes . second in two years.Third , overall . 
I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years ... and never have I had so much business from one client . 
why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ? 
basically , Rachel and I were in Vegas , and we got drunk . 
I &apos;m sorry , is this the same Rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ? 
yes , yes , yes.But I do not love her . 
that &apos;s better then . 
this was just a drunken mistake , and I need to get it annulled.I see . 
have you considered therapy ? 
I think just the annulment for today . 
there are some forms to fill out . 
it &apos;s easy . 
we &apos;ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind . 
it &apos;s no problem . 
we &apos;ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge . 
there &apos;s no way to do this without her ? because I kind of already told her it was taken care of 
of course you did . 
look , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there . 
what about someone who looks like Rachel ? 
I will think about the therapy . 
so I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff . 
okay . 
no point in dragging it out . 
dragging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore . 
okay 
what about this ? who gets this ? 
I don &apos;t know if I want it because it might be too many memories . 
what is that ? 
I don &apos;t know . 
how about this ? I want you to have the big plate . 
wow , Monica , thanks . I love this plate . 
something to remember me by . 
mon , you &apos;re not dying . I &apos;m just moving out . 
we &apos;re gonna see each other all the time . 
but still , it &apos;s a big change.The end of an era , you might say . 
are you okay ? you &apos;re not blinking . 
I &apos;m fine . I was thinking about how it &apos;s an end of an era . 
Oh , all right . 
but I gotta say , I don &apos;t think six years counts as an era . 
an era is defined as a significant period of time . 
it was significant for me . maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you ! 
-What is the matter with you ? -What is the matter with you ? ! 
why aren &apos;t you more upset ? aren &apos;t you gonna be sad that we &apos;re not living together ? 
aren &apos;t you gonna miss me at all ? 
Monica , all right . but don &apos;t get mad at me . 
it &apos;s just a little hard to believe.What &apos;s hard to believe ? 
I mean , it &apos;s you guys . you do this kind of stuff , you know ? 
you were gonna get married in Vegas , and then you backed out . 
I &apos;m not upset because I don &apos;t see you going through with it . I &apos;m sorry . 
it &apos;s going to happen.Chandler will move in here . 
but I .. 
I know , just let me finish , okay ? 
this isn &apos;t something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.This is something that we both really want . 
and it is going to happen.It is ? 
really ? yeah , sweetie . 
you mean , we &apos;re not gonna live together anymore ? 
no 
Oh , my God . I &apos;m gonna miss you so much.I &apos;m gonna miss you . 
I mean , it &apos;s the end of an era ! I know ! 
okay , bye . 
Oh , no . 
so did you get the annulment ? -I couldn &apos;t . 
I knew it . because you love Rachel . 
it &apos;s not that . annulments are more complicated .. 
it &apos;s complicated because of the love . 
I do not love Rachel . 
I &apos;m telling her about the whole thing ... so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible . 
would I do that if I loved her ? 
I &apos;ve never been more convinced of your love for her . 
I do not have feelings for Rachel , okay ? 
Oh , what &apos;s wrong ? 
Monica and Chandler are moving in here ... and I have to move out and everything is changing . 
Oh , my God , come here , come here . it &apos;s okay.Everything &apos;s gonna be okay . 
thank you . 
of course . 
so Ross and Rachel got married.Monica and Chandler almost got married . 
you think we should hook up ? 
Oh , we do.But not just yet . 
really ? well , when ? 
well , first Chandler and Monica will get married ... and be filthy rich , by the way . 
but it won &apos;t work out . 
wow . I know . 
then I &apos;ll marry Chandler for the money . 
and you &apos;ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.Great. 
but then we ditch them and we get married . 
we &apos;ll have Chandler &apos;s money and Rachel &apos;s kids . 
getting custody will be easy because of Rachel &apos;s drinking problem . 
what about Ross ? I don &apos;t want to go into the whole thing.But 
we have words and I kill him . 
23 , red and odd . 
motherfucker 
fucking nailed it , Tony ! 
23 . Sophia &apos;s birthday . I should have had that . 
got it like five ways there . 
six . he &apos;s on red too . 
you cocksucking motherfucker . 
what happened ? 
tone hit one straight up . 
66-1.0 going out . 
don &apos;t spill those . 
take it or play it ? 
let us play it . 
all right . 
all right , my man . 
23 and all around . 
you kidding ? 
you gotta ride that . 
one more time . 
23 , Come on . 
do it again ! 
23 , Come on . 
23 
23 . come on , bounce . 
do it again ! 
11 . 
fucking Christ . 
douchebags are taking it all back tonight . 
what the fuck , Vito ? you almost hit me . 
timber , motherfucker . 
stop right there ! 
ten to one odds . poor Boy &apos;s Delight and she fucking comes in . 
Oh ! 
look at this mezza-mort . 
hey . 
Sil . 
how are you , baby ? 
good to see you . 
sit down . 
can I get you something ? 
a coffee or a bun ? 
I &apos;ll let you two talk . 
so ? 
I really appreciate you letting me see you . 
and you &apos;ve been so decent about everything since Vito &apos;s death . 
I just don &apos;t know who else ... 
all right , all right . come on , Marie . 
what can I do ? 
it &apos;s Little V. 
the social worker says he &apos;s just acting out . 
social worker ? 
boy stuff mostly , 
but he is so angry . 
although some of what he &apos;s being accused of is just persecution . 
they claim that he hung the Petruzzos &apos; cat on their garage door , 
but it &apos;s totally unfounded . 
well , you know , in a way it &apos;s to be expected , with Vito passing and all that that entrailed . 
I think the only solution is to move away 
from that house and the kids at school . 
I figured it out , 
and I know it &apos;s a lot , 
but for 100,000 , 
we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened . 
my friend Cheryl lives in Orono , Maine , by the university . 
by the university . 
and there &apos;s this two-storey cape , 
with solid schools . 
you always said if there &apos;s anything you could do ... 
sure . 
have you talked to his uncle ? 
who ? 
Phil . 
Phil &apos;s not his uncle . him and I are second cousins . 
before we get too drastic here 
and uproot little Vito and all of you 
from your friends and your family , 
I should talk to him . he &apos;s impossible to talk to . 
it &apos;s not easy to substitute for a dad . 
I know . 
but maybe I can fill in here . 
OK , but you &apos;ll think about it ? 
believe me , I &apos;m gonna take care of you and he &apos;s gonna be OK . 
well , 
apparently Vito Junior &apos;s a whack job . 
no surprise there . family history ? 
she wants 100K for a change of scenery . 
that never works . 
she should get him a dog . 
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea . 
the point is , how the fuck is this my problem ? 
because I &apos;m the boss of the family ? 
where the fuck is Phil Leotardo ? 
he created the situation by clipping Vito to begin with . 
my best fucking earner . 
now second time around I &apos;m getting my pocket picked . 
not to mention he &apos;s his uncle 
or cousin or whatever the fuck . 
not your problem . I agree . 
I agree , Jim . 
I argued against the on-side kick . 
let us face it , they rarely work . 
the overworked Bucs D are falling apart 
as the Bills , 
with that play , are inside the 30 and loaded for goal . 
let us go . come on . 
just watch . 
- Bills will get another seven . - You think ? 
nah , I say a quick field goal wins it . 
absolutely . 
they &apos;ll choke . that &apos;s what they do . 
you got Buffalo , right , T ? 
line is three . I &apos;ll settle for a push . 
buffalo ! fucking go for it ! 
third and two , the snap . Losman &apos;s back , he hands it off . 
fumble ! 
ball &apos;s ... Buffalo recovers . 
fumble again . 
get him ! come on ! 
Oh , no . Oh , boy . get him ! 
buffalo scores as time expires . 
un-fucking-believable . 
buffalo ! fucking A ! 
listen to this fucking guy . probably won $ 35 down there . 
final score , Buffalo 28 , 
Tampa Bay 24 . 
skip , another beer ? 
no , I &apos;m gonna go take a snooze . 
beautiful , sweetheart . 
Nancy Sinatra , everybody . 
congratulations , Philly . 
thank you . 
we were gonna go the festival route 
but we found a guy who wants to distribute it himself , 
so we &apos;ll see . 
it &apos;s a good little movie . 
Jesus Christ , it &apos;s 11 : 30 . 
ready to call it ? 
an hour ago . 
I saw him bring Dean and Jerry back together . 
I was there at the telethon . 
I cried . 
you leaving already ? 
yeah , it &apos;s late . 
got a long hike to Jersey from here . 
sure , I used to drive it myself . 
no more , though . 
I &apos;ll be right back . 
congratulations again . 
listen , I gotta bring this up . 
a favour already ? 
excuse me ? 
Anthony , you always have business on your mind . 
take a night , smell the cognac . 
Marie Spatafore came to see me . 
she wants 100 grand to relocate 
on account of Vito Junior already has his own social worker . 
Patty told me there was doings . 
the turd doesn &apos;t fall far from the faggot &apos;s ass . 
that &apos;s beautifully put , 
but you &apos;re family , right ? cousins ? 
what can you do ? throw money at the problem ? 
well , somebody &apos;s gonna . 
I &apos;ll talk to the kid , set him right . 
good . 
you two going home together ? 
how the fuck are you ? 
fucking prostate keep me pissing all night . 
I wouldn &apos;t wish it on my worst enemy . 
a drink ? 
I talked to Phil about the split on the MRl centres . 
your cut is on the way . 
so is Christmas . 
you should have heard him tonight . 
comments , smug . 
really ? 
worries me . 
I thought we were getting along pretty good finally , 
you know , considering . 
could be the hubris , making boss . 
I think it &apos;s what went down with his brother Billy . 
I thought all that got buried with your cousin . 
you enjoy the dinner ? 
I left right after . 
yeah ? 
I don &apos;t know . 
I look at my key guys , 
Paulie , Christopher , my brother-in-law , 
what &apos;s number one on their agenda ? 
they &apos;re all fucking murderers , for Christ &apos;s sake . 
lonely at the top , boychik ? 
what I &apos;m trying to say is ... 
it &apos;s nice being here . 
always is . 
Oh . 
I brought you something . 
cover up that dome . 
actually , I was expecting something else . 
what , the fucking DVD ? 
it &apos;s a very unflattering portrait 
of ltalian-Americans . 
no , I was thinking maybe some of that 200,000 I loaned you ? 
Oh , Jesus . yeah , that &apos;s right . 
I know it &apos;s covered . it &apos;s just after a while ... 
you know , I lost track . 
I &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t . 
I don &apos;t wanna be a stickler . 
no . 
Anthony , come on . no , it &apos;s OK . it &apos;s OK . 
I got about three grand here . point and a half good ? 
no , come on , fuck this . 
you gotta have it . 
I don &apos;t want you eating cat food . 
stop it . 
I don &apos;t gotta have it . I don &apos;t want a vig from you . 
no , come on . 
I should have been on it . 
you sure ? 
Jesus Christ , are we good or what ? 
well , it &apos;s late . 
I should be getting back . 
you should get back to pissing , or whatever you ... 
I lend the guy money . suddenly I &apos;m the schmuck . 
why does he need your money ? 
why ? to cover his nut . 
between his gambling and the lifestyle 
and that boat ... 
3.2 mil . I warned him . 
it has absolutely no resale value whatsoever . 
does he listen ? 
I &apos;ve lent lots of money . 
once the chiselling starts , &quot; I forgot . &quot; 
who forgets ? fuck him . 
this is why I don &apos;t like you seeing him before bed . you &apos;re all upset . 
makes a big show of giving me a vig . 
3,000 a week . 
you got a lot of Jews in your business , right ? 
my business ? 
yeah , this . 
you gotta hand it to them , when it comes to money ... 
in my experience , 
that &apos;s nothing more than an ugly stereotype . really ? 
I got a friend , you tie a Krugerrand to a fishing line , you &apos;re gonna land him . 
right up on the dock by him . 
doesn &apos;t sound like you think of him as a friend . 
come on . we go way back . 
but that didn &apos;t stop him from busting my balls cos I owe him some money . 
anyway , I needed a little bridge loan 
to cover some of my gambling losses . 
still ? 
you know , good money after bad . 
why not just stop ? 
big part of my life . 
you &apos;ve been talking about it a lot . 
well , you lose sometimes . 
you gotta act like it hurts a little more than it does , for your guys . 
but if you &apos;re gonna lose , what &apos;s the fucking point ? 
so you need the risk . 
what are you chasing ? 
money or a high from winning ? 
before we end , 
there &apos;s something I need to bring up . 
you miss a lot of appointments . 
I always give you the required notice or I pay for the hour . 
that &apos;s not my point . 
well , I get busy . 
it &apos;s my fault . I &apos;ve condoned it for a long time . 
I haven &apos;t had a panic attack since my uncle shot me . 
did you notice that ? 
yes . 
well , it must be nice to know everything . 
is that the only reason why you &apos;re here ? 
the panic attacks ? 
no . 
this is an ... oasis in my week . 
so this is vacation ? 
no , I benefit in many ways . 
decide if you wanna keep coming , 
but you know there are protocols that you have to be followed 
or I won &apos;t be able to continue . 
OK , I will . 
now , I know Brian wants the media room downstairs , 
but I think it &apos;s better if the gym has access to the pool . 
that &apos;s the inspector . 
I told the guy to run cable for computers 
but I can &apos;t promise it &apos;s not already obsolete . 
hi . how are you ? Ted Yacanelli , Yacanelli Home lnspections .

you look like a Puerto Rican whore . you make me sick . 
so ? what &apos;s it gotta do with you ? 
listen , pally , you need to be rebellious . 
I raised kids . I get it . 
good for you .

you ever think what this is doing to your mother , 
what she &apos;s been through , how you &apos;re upsetting her ? 
she &apos;s just embarrassed . 
she cries for you . 
I &apos;m gonna say this cos you &apos;re old enough to understand . 
your family &apos;s had enough shame . 
you should set things right . 
you understand me ? 
no . 
Jesus Christ . be a man . 
be the kind of man she needs , strong , masculine . 
I said my piece . 
finish that thing . there &apos;s no eating in the car . 
I &apos;d like to take a minute for everybody to enjoy the fact 
that your mother has sold her house . 
Oh , my God , that &apos;s fantastic . 
congratulations , Mom . 
that &apos;s so good . 
it just passed inspection . 
Brian needs to get loan approval ...

I had a lot of support . 
Brian and Janine must be so happy . 
I hope so .

Oh , Jesus , Mellie .

what about the studs ? 
and those headers upstairs ? I &apos;m nauseous .

mortadella and provolone . 
that &apos;s Chrissy . 
the mysterious stranger .

yes , and it &apos;s normal . maybe it was the Kung Pao . 
get me a drink .

you know , he really helped me when I was in the hospital . 
never lend friends money , Eli . 
he still won &apos;t pay ? 
that &apos;s the least of it . 
he &apos;s all worked up or something . 
I don &apos;t like the way he talks . hostile remarks . 
it &apos;s not like him . makes me worry . 
yeah , I can see that . what are you thinking ? 
come on . 
Tony &apos;s not gonna hurt you . 
you &apos;ve seen how these ltalians work . 
for the most part , it &apos;s OK . 
get them cornered , you &apos;re dealing with nothing more than an animal . 
you think he &apos;s gonna kill you now ? 
I don &apos;t fucking know . 
he &apos;s the guy I call to deal with people like him . 
he &apos;s a rich man . he &apos;ll pay . 
his minus assets ? 
I &apos;d say under six . 
he &apos;s a boss . 
I &apos;ve known him a long time . 
money goes in one hand and out the other . 
the more he makes , the more he spends . 
his wife ? 
at what point is it cheaper for him to settle it another way ? 
yeah , right . time to go .

Oh , my God . Anthony .

it &apos;s gorgeous . 
I don &apos;t know what to say . 
look , I know you &apos;re scared , OK ? 
all the problems you had with Hector &apos;s dad ... I &apos;m not like that . 
I know . it &apos;s not just that . 
well , what , then ? I &apos;m gonna work my ass off . 
you know I &apos;ll always take care of you guys . 
in three months I made night manager of the pizzeria . 
in another three I &apos;ll be in charge of the day shifts . 
a couple of years , I &apos;ll own a chain of restaurants , clubs . 
you &apos;ll never have to work again . 
look , I love you . 
I love you too . 
so marry me , then . and we &apos;ll have kids . 
you always say you want Hector to have brothers and sisters . 
OK . 
can I get you some coffee ? 
no , I think it &apos;s time for our talk here . 
so what happened at school today ? 
I get blamed for everything . 
the girl was developmentally disabled . 
uncle Phil said he talked to you . 
is he just wasting his breath ? 
is that what you &apos;re telling us ? 
this trouble you &apos;re causing , 
I &apos;m disappointed cos you always were a good kid . 
you don &apos;t even know me . 
what is that supposed to mean ? 
sometimes you call me Carlo Jr . 
I couldn &apos;t shut your dad up about what a good kid you were . 
we were friends , you know . 
butt buddies ? 
you &apos;re being funny . 
that &apos;s good . 
cos I &apos;m sure you miss him a lot , 
whatever he was . 
and now I wanna say some things . 
you &apos;re gonna look at me . 
I &apos;m not moving to fucking Maine ! 
you think anybody wants that ? you know how much that &apos;s gonna cost your mother ? 
whatever . 
listen to me , OK ? 
I &apos;m not some fucking social worker . 
you knock this weird shit off 
or I &apos;ll introduce you to a plate-glass window . 
somebody should have told my dad to knock off the weird shit . 
you go about in pity for yourself . 
what about what your mother &apos;s been through ? 
what am I supposed to do about it ? 
your dad &apos;s gone . you &apos;re the man of the house . 
start fucking acting like it . 
you get me ? 
well , I just got back from the closing . 
come here ! 
we should pop the champagne or go out or something . 
maybe . I don &apos;t know . 
why not ? 
you know why not , Tony . 
it &apos;s upsetting , this whole thing . 
Jesus , the lumber again ? 
Carm , your cousin Brian has fucked over a lot of people . 
trust me . 
so how much in the end ? all in ? 
well , after construction , 
the purchase of the land , closing costs , 
it must be close to six . 
yeah . 
you know what you should do ? 
take a chunk of that and put it on the Jets . 
yes , very funny . 
I &apos;m serious . we can &apos;t get hurt . 
it &apos;s &quot; we &quot; now ? 
it &apos;s a sure thing . Celia , she works at the Bing , 
she &apos;s got a sister lives in San Diego , 
she &apos;s an osteopath , and she says that the Chargers &apos; QB 
has a hairline fracture in his right leg . 
and even Vegas doesn &apos;t know about it . 
I didn &apos;t say all of it . 
you know , just a piece of my half . 
you &apos;re rich , Tony . use some of those bundles to cover it . 
that money &apos;s for emergencies only , Carm . 
my other money &apos;s tied up in asset allocation . 
- What is that ? 
listen to me , OK ? this is the gravy . 
windfall cash . 
this is the kind of shit you play with . 
I &apos;m telling you , we are golden here . 
listen . 
forget it . 
I shouldn &apos;t have mentioned it . 
I mean it . 
it &apos;s all right , it &apos;s just I thought this was my money . 
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right . 
it &apos;s yours . 
Renata ? 
what ? 
go to the bedroom and lock the door . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
do as I ask . 
what are you doing here ? 
nice to see you too . 
I was watching CNN . fucking Hezbollah . 
we &apos;re running down to the boat show in Edison . 
thought you might want to join . 
I &apos;d love to . 
but Renata &apos;s got a migraine . 
that &apos;s too bad . 
the vig . three grands . should put us up to date . 
I can &apos;t take this . give it all to me whenever you can . 
you &apos;re gonna do this every time ? 
whatever you say . 
- Sit down . have a drink . 
we should get going , probably . 
OK . but next time . 
for sure ? 
yeah , next time I &apos;ll call first . 
did you see that pissy attitude ? 
come all the way out here to pick him up , 
not to mention give him his fucking vig in person . 
you believe this fucking guy ? 
should tell him to go fuck himself for his 200K . 
what &apos;s he gonna do about it ? 
to not pay my debts ? head of the family ? 
how &apos;s that gonna look ? 
who &apos;s gonna know ? 
it &apos;s like Eddie Valentine . 
that guy from Philly ? 
with the polio leg and the built-up shoe ? 
no , from the Twilight Zone . 
you must have seen that one . 
you should start sucking cock instead of watching TV Land 
cos Vito brought in three times what you do on construction . 
yeah . 
and I didn &apos;t have this fucking problem . 
God fucking damn it ! 
what ? 
that &apos;s good , right ? 
no . I only bet ten . 
- But you won . - What did I say ? 
what did I tell you ? it &apos;s a sure thing . 
you talk about this crap like it &apos;s science . 
I lost a lot of fucking money . 
you didn &apos;t lose . 
we could have turned your bullshit into a million dollars . 
my &quot; bullshit &quot; ? 
that spec house was my investment . 
for my future ! 
here we go . 
Ginny Sack had to move in with her daughter . 
again with Ginny Sack . 
John provided . she &apos;s a fucking hysteric . 
did you ever think I might know what I &apos;m doing ? 
you and the furniture and the cars . 
you would have spent everything I made if I let you . 
the next time you win I &apos;ll take a cut , 
and I &apos;ll roll the fucking dice . 
you already took your cut , from the bird feeder . 
and don &apos;t fucking deny it again . 
what ? 40 grand in the stock market ? 
I &apos;d ask for my piece , but there &apos;s nothing . 
that spec house ? I made the down payment . 
I bought the materials . 
I leaned on that building inspector when you had your thumb up your ass . 
so stop talking about your money ! 
let go of me , you piece of shit ! 
you &apos;re a shitty businesswoman who built a piece-of-shit house 
that &apos;s gonna cave in and kill that fucking unborn baby any day . 
and now you can &apos;t sleep . 
go fuck yourself ! 
when I &apos;m gone you can live in a dumpster for all I care . 
I was so ... I told you , dude . 
at three-point range the ball wouldn &apos;t hit the rim . 
that was the worst pass . 
get lost . 
nobody drop the soap . Spaz-a-fuckwit &apos;s in the house . 
you can see his pussy . 
what the fuck you looking at , fag ? 
what the fuck ? 
he shit . 
Oh , God ! 
Jesus , what &apos;s wrong with you ? 
he stepped in it ! 
gross ! 
he shit in the fucking shower ! 
are you crazy ? 
cocksucker &apos;s Corvair Monza is still in his garage , 
so we boost the piece of shit . 
we &apos;re heading down Communipaw Avenue 
and the fucking thing starts ... 
you get word on the power tools ? 
what ? yeah . spics in Florida sending the first truck Friday . 
how about the hardware store ? 
ready for the whole load . 
speaking of loads , hear about Vito Junior ? 
what ? 
Marie called . 
he got expelled cos he took a shit in the shower in gym class . 
that sick little fuck . 
you should see him . 
the make-up . 
and without school , Marie says he &apos;s shut in his room all day . 
probably thinking about how to pull a Columbine . 
but the little girl ... 
Francesca . 
her dad &apos;s gone , her brother &apos;s a psycho , 
her mother &apos;s a basket case . she &apos;s nine years old . 
what the fuck did she ever do ? 
tragedy . 
like a pebble in a lake . even the fish feel it . 
it &apos;s not right . 
Vito was one of us . 
so he sucked a cock . prior to that , he was our friend . 
can &apos;t just cut his family loose . 
that piece of shit , Phil , he &apos;s never gonna pony up . 
I tell you what , I will never forget that he didn &apos;t come through here . 
never . 
let it go , Tone . 
this is good of you , Tone , helping Marie . 
I &apos;ll always remember it . 
let us go . I gotta swing by Slava &apos;s , 
liquefy some offshore monies . 
yeah , dude . 
yeah . 
hey , Jesus , you got outta work early . 
I need to talk to you . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
your clothes . 
I just did laundry a couple days ago . 
it &apos;s not laundry . 
mami ! 
no , Papi , stay . 
what about the parade ? 
I &apos;m going with my brother . 
what ? 
I need to give this back to you . 
I can &apos;t keep it . 
why ? I mean , I love you . 
I love you , too , Anthony . 
look , I don &apos;t know . maybe I don &apos;t . 
all &apos;s I know is I just don &apos;t feel it . 
you hear about this thing with the Dolphins &apos; kicker ? 
he went under a whole truck . 
yeah , fucking motorcycles . 
helmet saved his life . 
he out for Sunday ? 
maybe the whole season . 
and the backup kicker ? he &apos;s right out of college . 
against Philly . 
too good to be true . 
I &apos;m gonna put the whole 100K down on Philadelphia . 
and if I win , Marie Spatafore gets a free ride and then some . 
yeah , good for you . 
cos Carlo said the kid went into the litter box and ate some cat shit . 
no , he took a shit , in the shower . 
glad we got that straight . 
hell of a finish . 
injuries , even tragedy , they are unable to stop Miami . 
final score , Miami 21 , Philadelphia 7 . 
when you get support like that , 
it makes all the difference . 
hey , Marie . how you holding up ? 
he snuck out again last night . 
like I told you , I want to help you . 
God bless you , Tony . I don &apos;t know what else to do . 
well , I do . 
there &apos;s this camp in ldaho and they handle kids like him . 
Idaho ? 
you know , like tough love ? you know ? 
saw it on TV , 
and honestly , I was moved to tears by some of the success stories . 
it &apos;s a camp ? 
a school camp . 
Tony . 
they allow corporal punishment . 
his guidance counsellor told me about those places , 
and they &apos;re in Utah and ldaho 
because state law allows them to strike the kids . 
that &apos;s just for the deterrent factor . 
it &apos;s 18 grand but I &apos;m gonna take care of it for you , 
so don &apos;t worry . 
there &apos;s no geographical solution to an emotional problem , Marie . 
Maine , wherever . 
Marie ? 
yeah ? 
I know it &apos;s hard , 
but it &apos;s the best thing for him . 
OK ? 
thank you , Tony . 
hey , Tone , isn &apos;t that ... 
what &apos;s their names ? used to hang out at the Bing . 
wake up , Vito . 
what ? 
Vito , my name is Steve . I &apos;m here to help you . 
you &apos;re gonna come with us now , all right ? 
come on . 
what ? 
come on . 
no , let me go ! 
come on . hey ! 
it &apos;s all right . 
let me go ! mom , no ! 
it &apos;s gonna be OK . 
I &apos;m so sorry , honey . 
stop . let me go ! 
it &apos;ll be OK . 
you have to be strong . you &apos;re doing the right thing . 
who are you ? 
Franny , go back to bed . 
Mrs Spatafore , he &apos;s gonna be fine . 
mom ! 
I &apos;m sorry , honey . 
no ! no . 
Oh , God . 
this one coming down to the buzzer . 
Stackhouse draining a three-pointer as time ran out , 
Ieading Dallas to a 109 to 108 victory over the visiting San Antonio Spurs . 
so what ? we &apos;re not speaking now ? 
listen to me , come here . 
what ? 
sit down . 
come on . 
I &apos;m sorry . 
I really am . 
you did real good with that house . 
and I should know . I &apos;m in construction . 
I &apos;m glad to hear you approve . 
I have been losing . 
I &apos;m fucking losing right now . 
a real shitty streak . 
so your solution is to risk more and make things even worse ? 
you start chasing it . 
and every time you get your hands around it 
you fall further backwards 
so this is about money ? cos it didn &apos;t feel like it . 
Carm , I swear to you , you &apos;re not gonna be like Ginny . 
I &apos;ve been real good about that 
and it &apos;s not gonna happen to us . 
I hate that you &apos;re going around acting all the time like it will . 
I worry , Tony . I do . 
you already got shot . 
now you won &apos;t go down and get the paper . who is out there ? 
come on ... 
what is it ? 
what are the million other possibilities ? 
the FBl waiting to take you away ? 
you eat and you play , 
and you pretend there &apos;s not a giant piano hanging by a rope over the top of your head every minute of every day . 
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve been thinking about this . 
now , I survived a fucking gunshot wound . 
what are the odds on that ? 
terrible . 
so if you think about it , 
I &apos;m up . 
what ? 
way up . 
that was me , not a fireboat . 
10 : 30 . 
10 : 30 . what would you like for breakfast ? 
Renata ? 
Renata ? 
Oh , God , no . 
wait . wait . Renata . 
Renata . 
Renata 
911 . what is the emergency ? 
she was a great girl . 
thanks . 
the best . 
I ... 
I brought your money . 
sorry for your loss .
