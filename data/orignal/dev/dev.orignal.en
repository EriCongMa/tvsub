okay , this is it . 
you sure you wanna do this ? 
hello , Mrs. Ross . woo-hoo ! 
well , hello , Mr. Rachel . 
my God . 
come on , Pheebs , hurry ! hurry , hurry , hurry.Okay ! okay ! 
my God ! is everybody getting married ? 
no running in the chapel . 
don &apos;t you give me any of your Hey ! 
hi . hey ! 
what are you guys doing here ? 
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married ! 
isn &apos;t that why you guys are here to find them ? 
yes . well that-yes . 
why else would we be here ? 
what happened ? did we miss it ? 
we actually missed it . 
well , maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had you run in the chapel ! 
this is insane . 
what &apos;s the big deal ? it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a real marriage . 
what ? 
if you marry in Vegas , you &apos;re only married in Vegas . 
what are you talking about ? 
if you get married in Vegas you &apos;re married everywhere . 
really ? 
yeah . 
my God . 
Oh , well . 
why are we in bed together ? 
I don &apos;t know . 
do you have any clothes on ? 
yes . 
really ? 
no . 
but we didn &apos;t have 
sex , did we ? 
I don &apos;t remember much about last night . 
it was such a blur . 
I remember laughing . I laughed a lot . 
then we didn &apos;t have sex . 
I mean , we were really drunk . 
I &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t do anything stupid . 
tell me about it . 
morning , Pheebs . 
my movie has been officially canceled . 
I &apos;m so sorry . you want some of my breakfast ? 
no , I &apos;m too depressed to eat . 
I &apos;ll probably eat in , like , five minutes . 
so I guess I &apos;ll fly home with you guys . what time is your flight ? 
what about my cab ? 
I don &apos;t need it anymore . 
you borrowed my cab , you have to drive it back . 
I don &apos;t want to drive all the way back by myself , I get so lonely . 
how about if you come with me ? 
I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a long trip . that would be great . 
we could talk and play games . 
this could be our chance to , like , renew our friendship . 
are you asking me to have a &quot; frienaissance &quot; ? 
sure ? 
all right , although I don &apos;t think we need one . 
baby.I never stopped loving you . 
hey . hey . 
so has anybody talked to Dr. And Mrs. Geller yet ? 
they left me a message ; they should be here any minute . 
where is the waitress ? I &apos;m starving . 
it &apos;s a buffet . 
here &apos;s where I win all my money back ! 
I gotta talk to you . 
sure . what &apos;s up ? 
Monica and I almost got married last night 
my God ! that &apos;s huge ! 
wait a minute . why wasn &apos;t I invited ? 
and who was gonna be your best man ? 
don &apos;t say Ross . do not say Ross . 
I just don &apos;t think we are ready to get married yet ! you know ? 
I mean , I love her and everything 
but seeing they coming out of that chape 
it was like a , like a wake-up call that we are moving so fast . 
how do I tell her without crushing her heart ? 
you tell her she &apos;s not marriage material . 
what ? 
girls say it to me all the time . 
and believe me if she &apos;s anything like me , she &apos;s just gonna be relieved . 
how do I tell Chandler that it &apos;s too soon . 
it &apos;s gonna break his heart , he &apos;s not gonna think that I don &apos;t love him anymore . 
yes , I do . 
you don &apos;t . 
good . I was just testing you . 
hey . Oh , hi . 
we were just talking about bacon . 
no , we were talking about tennis.Tennis is more believable . 
Hey.Hey. 
hi . thank you . 
coffee . 
what ? are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night ? 
what do you mean &quot; last night &quot; ? nothing , uh , happened last night . 
Ross invited us all to watch . 
Rach ! we weren &apos;t gonna miss our friends getting married ! 
who got married ? 
you did ? 
what ? 
we didn &apos;t get married . no , we didn &apos;t get married ! that &apos;s ridiculous ! 
I remember being in a chapel . 
they would not let us get married when we were that drunk . 
they let you get married when you &apos;re drunk ! most people who get married in Vegas are drunk ! 
I &apos;m drunk right now . 
I can &apos;t have a mimosa with breakfast ? I &apos;m on vacation . 
what are you guys gonna do ? 
I guess we find a divorce lawyer . 
I think Ross already has one . 
this one &apos;s free , right ? 
because you paid for the first two , third one free . 
laugh it up , but the joke &apos;s on you 
because we don &apos;t need to get divorced . we &apos;re just gonna get an annulment . 
an annulment ? 
Ross , I don &apos;t think surgery can help you . 
that &apos;s your thing ! 
what ? 
your thing , you &apos;re the guy who gets divorced . 
Oh , yeah . 
that &apos;s not &quot; my thing . &quot; 
I do not love getting divorced . 
yes , you do . this is your third divorce . 
you love divorce so much , you &apos;re probably gonna marry it 
and then it won &apos;t work out , so you &apos;re gonna have to divorce it , divorcing guy . 
I &apos;m so drunk . 
so , what do you think we should do ? 
I don &apos;t know . 
I know I love you . I know I love you . 
so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing ? I love you . 
that &apos;s a good question . 
last night we let the dice decide . 
we should leave it up to fate again . I love you ! 
we don &apos;t get married unless there &apos;s a sign . 
okay ? so say , 
you roll another eight , then there &apos;s a definite sign that we should get married . 
all right . eight we get married but others , we don &apos;t get married . 
sounds great . okay . 
we got a shooter . 
money , please . 
ready ? 
ready . 
come on , eight . 
yes , eight . 
eight , easy eight . 
wow ! I can &apos;t believe I actually rolled an eight . that was so unlikely . 
well , let us get married . I guess . 
that wasn &apos;t hard eight . last night I rolled a hard eight . 
that &apos;s right ! it was the wrong kind of eight , no wedding ! damn it ! 
I wanted it so bad ! 
wanna go pack ? 
yeah . 
we &apos;re doing the right thing , right ? 
of course we are ! we left it up to fate . 
if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign . 
okay , you have 19 questions left . use them wisely . 
come on . you can &apos;t win if you don &apos;t ask any questions ! 
what ? you promised me a fun road trip . 
we &apos;ve been on the road for 6 hours , and you &apos;ve been asleep for 5 and a half . 
we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back ! 
that will be your punishment , you greedy sleeper . 
all right . 
and until then , you are going to sing to me . 
because the radio &apos;s broken , and you are selfish , but you have a nice voice . 
really ? sing ! 
this is a long drive . 
are my eyes open ? 
no ! 
morning . 
hey , hubby . 
I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing . 
I &apos;m not gonna do that . 
okay . 
so we &apos;ll just stay married . 
yes , exactly . 
and I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller . 
this is so amazing . 
I , uh , really thought I &apos;d have to talk you into this more . 
now I &apos;m scared because I don &apos;t actually think you &apos;re kidding . 
I &apos;m not kidding . 
look , I 
I can &apos;t have three failed marriages . I can &apos;t , okay ? 
I am not gonna be that guy . 
so , we just stay married forever ? 
okay , how ? 
how is this going to affect you , really ? 
I mean , you fill some form out once in a while 
instead of checking the box &quot; Miss , &quot; you check the box that says , &quot; Mrs. &quot; 
it &apos;s right next to it . 
okay , I &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right . we absolutely can stay married , 
because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other . 
all right . 
please take a moment here 
and think about what you &apos;re asking of me . 
I am asking you to do me a favor . 
you are asking me to be your wife . 
and , as my wife , I think you should grant me this favor . 
that kid really kicked me hard on the plane . 
well , you did pull his hair . 
he took my snack . I &apos;m not getting into this again . 
all right . hurts really bad . 
I told you not to walk . here . 
there . there . okay . 
this doesn &apos;t mean anything , does it ? 
no . 
how could you pick up a hitchhiker ? 
he could be a rapist or a killer or something . 
don &apos;t you think I asked him that before he got in ? 
I &apos;m not talking to you . you go back to sleep . 
are you a rapist ? 
no . 
do you like car games ? 
yeah , you know the , uh , license plate game ? 
I love the license plate game ! 
I &apos;ll play . I &apos;ll play . 
no , you need your sleep . night-night . shh . 
hey . hey . 
listen . I know you wanted to talk to me 
but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married . 
we register 
and you get to keep all the presents . 
no , Ross . listen to me . 
I &apos;ve thought about how to tell you this 
the bottom line is we cannot stay married . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true . Oh , but it is . 
you know what this is ? 
this is a difference of opinion . 
when that happens in a marriage . Ross ! 
this is not a marriage ! this is the world &apos;s worst hangover ! 
if you do not get this annulment , I will . 
all right . I &apos;ll do it . 
thank you . 
is there any such thing as an annulment shower ? 
there &apos;s the train station , where I get off . 
I have your address and phone number . 
and I have your name and the fact that you &apos;re a drifter . 
so ball &apos;s pretty much in your court . 
all right . see you . 
come on , I can &apos;t take this any more . please talk to me . 
let me make it up to you , huh ? 
stop it ! 
that &apos;s not fair . you know I can &apos;t resist that beautiful voice . 
Pheebs , I am so sorry . 
I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn &apos;t deliver . 
now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship . 
so I will strive to stay awake for as long as I know you . 
you can still sleep at night and stuff . 
thank you . 
so can we play 20 Questions now ? 
I &apos;ve got a really good one ! I &apos;ve been thinking about it since Kansas . 
okay . 
is it a kind of hot sandwich ? 
yes . 
is it a meatball sub ? 
that is incredible ! 
you are the master ! 
bug ! 
that &apos;s funny . you look like you &apos;re 
don &apos;t say it ! don &apos;t even think it . 
all right . 
Chandler , enjoy your handful . 
should we just get married ? 
all the signs are telling us to do it . 
I &apos;m sick of the signs . 
it &apos;s too fast . I &apos;m happy the way things are . 
me too . 
I don &apos;t want change , do you ? 
no . 
all right then , then nothing changes ! everything is great ! 
and you go unpack because it &apos;s been three days and it &apos;s driving me insane ! 
relax , it &apos;s not like we &apos;re marry . 
I was thinking , what if I unpack here ? 
all your stuff would be here . 
well What if all my stuff was here ? 
then you &apos;d be going back and forth all the time . 
doesn &apos;t make any sense . 
what if we live together , and you understand what I &apos;m saying ? 
live together ? 
there &apos;ve been no signs for that . 
me asking is kind of a sign . 
yes ! yes ! 
yes . 
okay . wait . 
okay . here &apos;s your key . 
you have to christen it ! now , go out and come back in ! 
door hasn &apos;t been locked in five years , but okay .

no , it &apos;s a very old key ! 
it &apos;s an old key ! 
my God , it &apos;s old . 
I love you . 
I love you . 
are you hugging the door right now ? 
no . 
yeah , me neither .

he told me to meet him at Modell &apos;s . 
he told me to shine my shoes . 
Oh , my God . Christopher ! 
find a matching shirt and tie for me . not the camellia . Paulie has one . 
I can &apos;t believe it . I mean , I knew it would happen , but ... 
so now can we get out of here ?

all right , finish up over there . 
you know why we &apos;re here . 
so if you &apos;ve got any doubts or reservations , say so . 
no one will think any less of you . 
because once you enter this family , there &apos;s no getting out . 
this family comes before everything else . everything . 
before your wife , your children , your mother and your father . 
it &apos;s a thing of honor . 
if something happens and you can &apos;t earn ... 
... we &apos;ll take care of you . 
that &apos;s part of it . 
if you got a problem , you just gotta let somebody know . 
this man right here , he &apos;s like your father . 
no matter if it &apos;s with somebody here or outside ... 
... you bring it to him , he &apos;ll solve it . 
you stay within the family . 
all right , give me your hand . 
okay . 
that &apos;s St. Peter , my family saint . 
as the card burns ... 
... so may your soul , if you betray your friends in the family . 
now rub your hands together like this and repeat after me . 
may I burn in hell ... 
may I burn in hell ... 
... if I betray my friends . 
... if I betray my friends . 
congratulations . 
my heart &apos;s pounding . 
you done good with the sports book . 
yeah , it &apos;s been good . 
I &apos;m gonna give it to you . it &apos;s yours . 
I was wondering what it was gonna be . 
you &apos;re a made guy now . 
it &apos;s your turn to make real money , and I get to relax . 
your only problem is to give me 10 points of the take each settle-up day . 
other than that , you got no problem . 
my only problem in life ? I gotta kick my points to that man over there . 
and onward goes this thing of ours . 
when you think of all the headaches people have ... 
... ours are boiled down to one . 
not a bad deal . 
you got it . 
there &apos;s a six-G minimum every week . 
I gotta get something out of this . 
six grand could be a lot or a little . 
depends on you , and how much you grow the business . 
I love you , Paulie . 
we &apos;re in it together now . 
I love you too , kid .

well , what &apos;re you gonna do ? 
you pick up the pieces and go on . 
I meant your spells .

how do you know about that ? 
everyone knows . 
it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of . 
Julius Caesar was an epileptic . 
I &apos;m not epileptic . 
whatever it is , take care of yourself . 
it &apos;s your health . 
is the psychiatrist helping ? 
you know about that ? 
there &apos;s no stigmata these days . 
my kid saw one for that thing with his wife . 
they &apos;re happy now . 
what about privacy ? 
our family &apos;s done business a long time with the Sopranos . 
peacefully and profitably . 
I wanna keep it like that . 
take care of this . 
all right , Carmine . 
be a better friend to yourself . 
I will . I appreciate your concern . really . 
Jayne was determined to &quot; bust &quot; into the business , so to speak . 
Hollywood folklore has it that she called Paramount Pictures and said : 
&quot; my name &apos;s Jayne Mansfield and I wanna be a movie star . &quot; 
you got a phone call from some young kid . 
drew . he asked when you were going home . 
how &apos;d he sound ? 
like he was about 15 years old . 
wait . is that your so-called fianc ? 
he &apos;s 19 , and he can go all night . 
when are you going back to Seattle , Janice ? 
it depends on how long it takes to settle Ma &apos;s estate . 
estate ? a falling-down house and some old-lady underwear . 
sad , isn &apos;t it ? what it all comes to . 
you know how much we love you . 
and you know we love having you around . 
but there &apos;s a big house over there . 
and I know you want maximum value . 
so for security , or so it don &apos;t fall into disrepair , you could stay there . 
I been thinking the same . 
I just don &apos;t wanna push Svetlana out . 
I talked to her . 
she &apos;s moving out tomorrow , maybe the next day . 
really ? 
yeah .

I better go pack .

we were talking about our former school . they got the coffeehouse . 
it &apos;s a pure cash operation . the beauty part is ... 
... I mean , who &apos;s gonna stop you ? kids ? campus security ? 
what are you telling him about that ? that &apos;s ours . 
watch where the fuck you &apos;re going !

asshole ! I know where you live ! 
you hear what I said ? 
good talking to you , Chris . keep Dino in mind . 
I &apos;m not to be an asshole , but I can &apos;t be seen in a place like this anymore . 
all right . 
this has gotta start showing results , or end . 
I talked to a business associate about these panic attacks . 
enough fucking around . enough money in your pocket . 
what &apos;s the story here ? 
the latest treatment of Panic Attack Syndrome is a three-part approach . 
it &apos;s a syndrome ? 
medication for depression , psychotherapy ... 
... and cognitive behavioral therapy . 
you &apos;re on medication . 
if you feel ready , you could see a behaviorist . 
you mean talk to somebody else ? 
you seem unhappy with my approach . 
if you &apos;re really ready to commit to mental health , I say great . 
let us get going , I &apos;m ready to help . 
but we &apos;ll have to delve deeper . focus . 
this latest incident , for our starters . 
all right . fine . 
my daughter brought home a black . 
they were on the couch , watching TV . they are snuggling . 
and ? 
she went upstairs , and I had a frank conversation with Buckwheat . 
I told him to stay the fuck away from my daughter . 
and she came downstairs and they left . 
then you had the attack ? 
not right then . I went to the kitchen for a sandwich , I opened the cabinet ... 
... I saw a box of Uncle Ben &apos;s rice . boom ! 
I see . it &apos;s the rice logo . 
the first onset of hyperventilation , that occurred upon you seeing the rice ? 
no . I was taking the capocollo and shit out of the fridge . 
I &apos;m thinking when you first came here , the panic attacks with ducks ... 
... as I remember it , you were grilling meat , weren &apos;t you ? 
the memory on you . 
sausages , wasn &apos;t it ? 
sausages . steaks . yeah . 
wow . let us get back to that capocollo . 
I gotta take that . it &apos;s my busy season . 
yeah ? 
fifty ? 
that &apos;s pretty rich for one game . 
if he &apos;s good for it , take it . 
but keep me posted on Duke-Wake Forest . 
all right . 
sorry . 
where were we ? 
the connection between your anxiety attacks and meat . 
right . 
what was it again ? 
closing Ohio State . they &apos;re kicking off . 
who you like ? lowa ? 
they are no difference , as long as it pays . 
Chris , fuck . Oregon vs. USC ? 
I told you we should have laid off some of that action . 
spread &apos;s 11 . 
Oregon &apos;s down by 12 , they &apos;re on the 45 , no timeouts . 
Oregon &apos;s got an All-American field-goal kicker . 
why didn &apos;t somebody tell me ? 
see ? 
and it &apos;s good ! 
forty-three yarder . 
that spread could &apos;ve opened at 18 , fucking top 10 team ! 
we should have laid off some . Paulie did it all the time . 
you see him here ? 
what &apos;s the matter with you people ? answer the fucking phones ! 
minor setback , that &apos;s all . 
Oh , yeah ? 
the frost is on the pumpkin . 
supposed to warm up . 
it &apos;s good football weather . 
mom said she &apos;s waiting for the meat you roasted . 
did Jackie Jr. show ? 
I don &apos;t know . 
little fuck promised he &apos;d be here . 
watch your mouth in front of my kid . 
probably keeping a booth warm at the O.F. , him and Dino Zerilli . 
what &apos;s he doing ? I told his father I &apos;d try to keep him out of this . 
he &apos;s the heir apparent . 
he is not this kid . 
do me a favor . watch out for Jackie , okay ? 
you ought to turn that one link there . 
little setback , huh ? 
Ro , your kid &apos;s late . it &apos;s rude , he should be set straight . 
he &apos;ll be here . I paged him . the poor kid lost his dad . 
I lost mine when I was 6 . 
Ralph had to drop out of 11 th grade to raise his siblings . 
you &apos;d never know it . 
I &apos;m Satan to this kid , just because I &apos;m in love with his mom . 
what are we talking about ? 
the cheerleaders . any hotties ? 
there &apos;s no cheerleaders for freshman ball . 
these are Mario Batali &apos;s string beans , with Parmesan . 
you are very late , young man . 
it &apos;s me . 
Meadow ! hi , babe . 
who is it ? 
it &apos;s Meadow . what are you doing ? 
nothing . what &apos;s going on ? 
well , Sunday dinner . 
yeah ? 
do you wanna talk to your dad ? he &apos;s outside . 
burning a cross ? 
I don &apos;t know what you mean , but it &apos;s not the proper time . 
your brother wants to talk to you . 
no , I don &apos;t . 
hello ? 
hi . what &apos;s up ? 
everybody &apos;s here . it &apos;s boring . 
is that Jackie ? 
it &apos;s not him . it &apos;s Meadow , from school . 
hold on , call waiting . hello ? 
my mother there ? 
yeah . 
aunt Ro ? yeah , I gotta go . 
thank you . 
where are you ? 
I can &apos;t make it . 
we &apos;re all waiting . you promised . 
fuck it . 
the way he talks to me ... 
I &apos;ll bring it up to Tony , maybe he &apos;ll talk to him . 
Paulie ? 
what time is it ? 
that &apos;s almost all of it . 
Warren probably told you about Oregon-USC . 
this is unacceptable . 
it &apos;s $ 4000 . I &apos;ll have the rest in a few days . 
I thought I made myself clear . 
fucking college ball . but I learned a valuable lesson . 
I &apos;m not running a school , kid . 
Paulie , this is me . you know I &apos;m good for it . 
don &apos;t drag in our friendship . you work for me . 
I want to ... 
shut up and listen . 
I &apos;ll give you a few days ... 
... but it &apos;ll cost another your two G &apos;s as a reminder not to fuck it up . 
I make myself clear ? 
and don &apos;t give me the malocchio . I &apos;m not the one with the short bag . 
any word from your lvy Leaguer ? how &apos;s Carm with the empty nest ? 
empty ? Meadow &apos;s always home with laundry or hauling food out .

Jesus Christ .

he never wanted this for you . he wanted you to be a doctor . 
give me a fucking break .

I &apos;m no doctor . 
know how hard you have to work to get your MD ? 
how many years ? 
I was thinking osteopathy , but I don &apos;t have the grades for that . 
you &apos;re not gonna drop out of Rutgers ? 
no . but those premed courses almost killed me . 
I only did it because my dad was sick . 
but you should know he never wanted this life for you . 
and I &apos;ll tell you something . I don &apos;t want it for my son , either . 
come on ! let us go , I wanna see you hit them ! get off the ball !

so I &apos;ll take you to Stewart &apos;s and buy some dogs . 
I just wanna go home .

I need you home , Tony , for dinner .

pass the potatoes to me , please . 
Anthony ? the potatoes ? 
sorry . 
every night . 
go ahead . pour yourself another glass .

nana was asking me where you might want to go to college . 
I don &apos;t know . 
West Point . 
West Point ?

no , I didn &apos;t . 
Oh , yeah , you did .

I feel bad . taking your old room . 
don &apos;t worry about it . you &apos;re all settled in . 
you could sleep in your mother &apos;s room . 
pass . 
won &apos;t be for long . 
Bill &apos;s children go to live with their mother , end of week . I stay with him . 
a few days is not a problem . I &apos;m glad I can help you out . 
God knows my brother used to sleep like a dead man in there . 
I &apos;m sorry about how I behaved at the cemetery . 
Janice . I cannot give records back . 
I wish you &apos;d reconsider . 
I know Livia left no will , but possession is 9 / 10 of law . 
let us not descend into that . 
feeling in me is , she is not here to ask . 
I know . I &apos;m sorry . this is an emotional issue for me . 
I thought that if we could talk one-on-one ... 
... I could make you understand how much those records mean to me . 
just promise me you &apos;ll sleep on it . 
it was that fucking bird in the window ! 
it was a coincidence . 
I was making good jack ! now everything turns to shit ? 
the bird thing is if it &apos;s in the house . and that &apos;s death , not bad luck . 
will your mother loan me money ? 
she &apos;s paying for her hysterectomy . 
where &apos;s that bracelet I got you ?

I &apos;m sorry . 
Jesus-fucking-Christ . 
Janice ! Janice ! Janice !

only an hour , then starts to hurt . 
I &apos;m getting married . did you know ?

wish you all the best . 
she put into my Sprite three Halcyon . 
I miss you so much , Tony . 
let us stick to the subject . your cousin &apos;s missing a leg . 
$ 20,000 . that &apos;s what it cost , leg she took . 
flex foot , latest technology with vertical shock pylon . 
plus , calfskin boot . 
Kenneth Cole . 
you don &apos;t even want to talk to me . I don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t be friends . 
I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m doing here , except you worked it this way . 
we could have talked on the phone . 
I &apos;m sorry , Tony . 
it &apos;s not your fault . 
look , I &apos;m sorry about your leg . 
I &apos;ll reach Janice . 
Janice put any food in there ? 
no , but I have orange juice . 
plus there are two Miller Genuines . 
and your mother &apos;s meat delivery still is coming every week . 
southern California vs. Notre Dame . 
we &apos;re in Indiana on a perfect football afternoon . 
see you next week . 
thank you . 
I was just gonna call you , Johnny . 
Oh , yeah ? 
someplace we can talk in private ? 
I &apos;m kind of busy . 
gonna call . 
now you &apos;re busy . 
something I could get you , Junior ? 
no , I &apos;m good . 
it &apos;ll just take a minute . 
Anthony , I told you to wait in the car ! 
listen to your old man , Anthony . 
so , what were you gonna call me about ? 
I don &apos;t got it . 
Weasely son of a bitch ! 
can &apos;t you make payments ? see me . work out a plan . 
I swear , a vendor owes me $ 300 . 
shut the fuck up ! 
your wife &apos;s weekly order &apos;s ready . 
it &apos;s gotta be $ 30 worth of meat there . 
capocollo , chops and a standing roast . 
you gonna backtalk me ? junior , get him over here . 
no , wait , please ! what are you gonna do ? 
Anthony , what did I fucking tell you ? 
what , your father never cut off anybody &apos;s pinky ? 
that &apos;s traumatic 
for anyone to witness , much less an 11-year-old . 
actually , it wasn &apos;t . 
it was a rush , if you want to know the truth . 
you want me to delve ? 
go on . 
dinner &apos;s ready . 
come here . 
come on , I wanna talk to you . 
what you seen today , Anthony , a very sad thing . 
you disobeyed your old man , and I ought to give you the belt . 
but I gotta say that ... 
... a lot of boys your age would have run 
like a girl . but you stayed . 
I know you like Mr. Satriale . we all do . he &apos;s a lovely man . 
the man is a gambler . 
he got over his head in debt . he owed me money and refused to pay . 
he avoided me . 
that &apos;s why you should never gamble , Anthony . 
what was I supposed to do ? 
这是我的生存之道That &apos;s my livelihood . 
it &apos;s how I put food on the table . 
you should never gamble , Anthony . 
Johnny , dinner &apos;s ready ! Anthony ! Janice , turn that off . 
let this be a lesson to you . 
a man honors his debts . 
beautiful cut he sent . 
you like it standing with the bone in , Lee ? 
look at those juices . 
go , Wayne Newton . 
can I have the end piece ? 
Johnny , let us eat while it &apos;s still hot . 
you bet , baby . the lady loves her meat . 
four stitches . ruined dinner . 
this was your first panic attack ? 
fainted , my old man called it . 
obviously , we &apos;ve finally touched on something here . 
what you witnessed that day . where the meat came from . 
and your mother &apos;s great pleasure in it . 
it was the one time she &apos;d be in a good mood ... 
... when the weekly delivery from Satriale &apos;s came . 
or Fusco , the vegetable man , maybe . 
probably the only time the old man got laid . 
probably . 
pretty sick , huh ? 
getting turned on by free cold cuts ? 
did your mother question why the meat was free ? 
meat that was going into her children &apos;s mouths ? 
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t wanna know . 
I don &apos;t wanna think about any of it . 
I &apos;m sure it was too much for you then too . that &apos;s why you short-circuited . 
you are in your puberty . witnessing not only your mother and father &apos;s sexuality ... 
... but also the violence and blood so closely connected ... 
... to the food you were about to eat . 
and also , the thought that someday ... 
... you might be called upon to bring home the bacon . 
like your father . 
all this from a slice of capocollo ? 
kind of like Proust &apos;s madeleines . 
what ? 
Marcel Proust . 
he wrote a seven-volume classic , Remembrance of Things Past . 
he took a bite of a madeleine . 
it &apos;s a kind of tea cookie he used to have as a child . 
and that one bite unleashed a tide of memories of his childhood ... 
... and ultimately of his entire life . 
this sounds very gay . I hope you &apos;re not saying that . 
no . 
understanding root causes makes you less vulnerable to future episodes . 
my fucking head is swimming here . 
we &apos;re gonna have to stop . it &apos;s a lot to process . 
but we &apos;ve made real progress today . good work . 
and I &apos;d really like you to write down any thoughts or associations . 
see the left tackle ? 
he fakes inside , and then gets a spin move on the guy . 
now he &apos;s charging the quarterback . see ? 
I thought the tailback had it . 
you gotta keep your eye on the ball . 
okay , I &apos;m going . 
where ? 
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes , she &apos;s been missing my braciole . 
can I come ? 
hey , we &apos;re watching the game . 
I can catch the game in the car . 
it &apos;s nice he wants to visit his sister . 
you &apos;re right . I &apos;ll get my shoes . 
why not watch your game ? 
what , I shouldn &apos;t go now ? 
A.J. , why don &apos;t you bring this stuff out to the car ? 
this is about Sambo , right ? 
I &apos;m paying for that goddamn college . 
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . 
but if you want to make a scene ... 
... then comb your hair and come along . embarrass her . 
alienate her . or better yet , cut her off . 
let her drop out and go to a state school . or move back in here . 
I was just trying to protect her . and I &apos;ll do that till I die . 
I &apos;m not gonna tell you you can &apos;t come . she &apos;s your daughter . 
I &apos;ll probably watch the game . 
Garcia handing off at the 40-yard line across to the 43 . 
Garcia handing off at the 40-yard line across to the 43 . 
leave me the fuck alone . 
go for the touchdown . I need another five points to cover the spread . 
hi . pardon me . 
here she is . come on . Meadow ! 
we &apos;re here . 
this is my mom and my brother , A.J. 
hey . 
dad didn &apos;t come ? 
no , he didn &apos;t . did you want him to ? 
Noah , would you mind ? 
Noah told me what Dad said . 
it &apos;s out in the open , so fuck this . 
let us watch the latrine-lip . 
Oh , what &apos;d Dad say ? 
Anthony , wait for me downstairs . I want to talk to your sister . 
Oh , I know what he said . 
go . 
I &apos;m always being sent away . why do I bother going anywhere ? 
what did your father say ? 
like he didn &apos;t tell you . 
believe what you like ... 
he called Noah things so ugly ... 
... I can &apos;t even repeat it . 
you &apos;re right . there &apos;s no excuse . 
he &apos;s lucky I didn &apos;t punch him out . 
because you &apos;re civilized . 
so this was gonna be a big drama ? 
you wanted your father to subject your friend to this again ? 
wait . so I &apos;m in the wrong ? 
the rest of the world should work around ... 
... his racist , retrograde , fucking-asshole personality ? 
he &apos;s from a place and a time where he thinks it &apos;s in your best interest . 
new Jersey ? the third millennium ? 
Noah , you know what I mean . 
you are coming from a racially-mixed marriage and you must have been a burden . 
don &apos;t slam his background . look what you wound up in ! 
excuse us , Noah . I want a word with my daughter . 
I &apos;m not going anywhere unless she wants me to . 
it &apos;s okay . I &apos;ll be up in a little while . 
I &apos;d hate to think you &apos;re airing family business in public . 
Noah &apos;s not stupid . it took him a while , but he caught on . 
he keeps his opinions to himself . 
unlike some people , he &apos;s brilliant and sensitive . 
I &apos;ll keep my mouth shut . 
anything I say to you , or your father , will just fuel this . 
I &apos;m not gonna stop seeing Noah . 
I put your helmet there . though I &apos;d rather you not bike in the city . 
if you must know , I &apos;m going to Litchfield , Connecticut ... 
... to the weekend home of Noah &apos;s parents &apos; friends , who work at NBC . 
but Hegel is talking about ... 
Svetlana , get out here ! 
Oh , hi . 
you must be the famous Bill . moving day , huh ? 
I didn &apos;t think you would have the nerve to show your face to me . 
why ? what &apos;s wrong ? 
don &apos;t bullshit me . where is my leg ? 
your leg ? Oh , yeah , where &apos;s your ... ? 
I know you took it . 
that &apos;s preposterous . how could I use it ? 
you think that will make me give records back , but you &apos;re wrong . 
if you see a karmic connection between my mother &apos;s records and your missing leg , wow ! 
the records return , and so does the leg . I see how you got there . 
how do you live with yourself ? 
Bill , don &apos;t waste breath . 
this cunt is gonna be sorry she ever fuck with me . 
you better hope you have all your shit , &apos; cause I &apos;m calling the locksmith . 
Doc . where &apos;s Dino ? 
they got him for possession . what do you care ? 
he mentioned a job at Rutgers . a coffeehouse . 
coffeehouse , shit . we were gonna jack a benefit concert there tonight . 
can you make it work without Dino ? 
it was my fucking idea . 
I know this must be hard , Anthony . 
your sister off at college , you all by yourself with us . 
but it won &apos;t be for long . 
soon , you &apos;ll be heading off to college yourself . 
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m gonna go . 
college ? of course you will . 
I don &apos;t wanna talk about it right now . 
there &apos;s so many people , all smarter than me . a bunch of freaks . 
what ? 
you &apos;re not excused ! 
you &apos;re punished ! 
he &apos;s all right . Lascia lui . 
move this car and your life will not be worth shit . 
get me Jewel &apos;s autograph . 
you &apos;re a good kid . I &apos;ll bring you her underpants . 
all goes in there , no one gets shot . 
Oh , my God ! 
you &apos;re robbing a benefit concert . 
is that all there is ? 
most people used student cards . 
hey ! what &apos;s going on ? 
say one word on that fucking thing and you &apos;re dead ! 
hit it ! 
there &apos;s your money . 
you ought to hit a tanning salon . 
I had a late night . 
give that shit a rest . 
man needs his seven hours to keep sharp . 
this was work . little Jackie hyped us to a score at Rutgers , not bad . 
what &apos;s the matter , Chrissy ? tell Uncle Paulie . 
being made isn &apos;t like I thought . a lot of responsibilities . 
what did you think ? 
you &apos;re as smart as the week &apos;s lines . 
one mistake and you &apos;re chasing , not making , money . 
welcome to the NFL , rookie . go home , get some sleep . 
tomorrow &apos;s a new day . 
sorry I &apos;m late . I had to make a few stops . 
have a smelt . 
no . 
we had a very good week this week , boss . 
how &apos;s our little friend doing ? 
he had some knocks . 
came out all right . 
wait &apos;ll he hears the policy on newly-made guys . 
they &apos;re subject to strip search for wires . 
he &apos;ll love that . 
he had to augment his kick with a stickup little Jackie put him onto . 
Jackie Aprile ? 
he did the thing in the papers ? 
he was only the wheel man . 
I told Christopher to leave him out . 
I &apos;m just telling you what I know . 
don &apos;t be too hard on him . he &apos;s having a hard enough time . 
what &apos;s wrong with him ? when &apos;s he gonna grow up ? 
where &apos;s Soprano ? 
here . 
guys , take a good look at Soprano and remember his performance last week . 
he &apos;s on the sidelines three quarters , waiting . does his mind go soft ? 
no . does his fire go out ? heck , no . 
when the call came , he brought his A game . 
he may have a big future . he may be a leader . 
that &apos;s what it takes . and that &apos;s why I &apos;m naming him defensive captain . 
all right ! so let us hit those showers , one thought in mind ... 
Soprano ! Soprano , you all right ?
