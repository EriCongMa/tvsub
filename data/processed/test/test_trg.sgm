</p>
<p>
<seg id=241> so that &apos;s your second marriage in two years ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=242> yes . second in two years.third , overall .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=243> i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years ... and never have i had so much business from one client .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=244> why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=245> basically , rachel and i were in vegas , and we got drunk .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=246> i &apos;m sorry , is this the same rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=247> yes , yes , yes.but i do not love her .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=248> that &apos;s better then .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=249> this was just a drunken mistake , and i need to get it annulled.i see .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=250> have you considered therapy ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=251> i think just the annulment for today .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=252> there are some forms to fill out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=253> it &apos;s easy .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=254> we &apos;ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=255> it &apos;s no problem .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=256> we &apos;ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=257> there &apos;s no way to do this without her ? because i kind of already told her it was taken care of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=258> of course you did .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=259> look , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=260> what about someone who looks like rachel ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=261> i will think about the therapy .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=262> so i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=263> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=264> no point in dragging it out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=265> dragging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=266> okay</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=267> what about this ? who gets this ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=268> i don &apos;t know if i want it because it might be too many memories .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=269> what is that ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=270> i don &apos;t know .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=271> how about this ? i want you to have the big plate .</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=279> oh , all right .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=280> but i gotta say , i don &apos;t think six years counts as an era .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=281> an era is defined as a significant period of time .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=282> it was significant for me . maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you !</seg>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=54> although some of what he &apos;s being accused of is just persecution .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=55> they claim that he hung the petruzzos &apos; cat on their garage door ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=56> but it &apos;s totally unfounded .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=57> well , you know , in a way it &apos;s to be expected , with vito passing and all that that entrailed .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=58> i think the only solution is to move away</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=59> from that house and the kids at school .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=60> i figured it out ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=61> and i know it &apos;s a lot ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=62> but for 100,000 ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=63> we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=64> my friend cheryl lives in orono , maine , by the university .</seg>

<p>
<seg id=151> they shouldn &apos;t let you get married ... when you &apos;re drunk and have writing on your face . it &apos;s nevada &apos;s fault .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=152> so what do you think ? who wouldn &apos;t want to date him ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=153> the divorces don &apos;t bother me . i &apos;d date him . but not while he &apos;s still married .</seg>

<seg id=157> so i decided that .. good . good . whatever .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=158> how about you , meg ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=159> well , i don &apos;t care about the divorces , either . but i wouldn &apos;t date him .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=160> normally , he doesn &apos;t sweat this much .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=161> it &apos;s just that he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel girl . what ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=162> she said , &quot; he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel girl . &quot;</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=169> i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re wrong . i just don &apos;t want to be divorced three times .</seg>
</p>

<seg id=232> what , are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=233> i mean , did we not have as much fun ?</seg>

<p>
<seg id=235> when we told joey , he cried his eyes out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=236> i did not cry my eyes out .</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id=239> you got married again ?</seg>

<p>
<seg id=241> so that &apos;s your second marriage in two years ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=242> yes . second in two years . third , overall .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=243> i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years ... and never have i had so much business from one client .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=244> why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=245> basically , rachel and i were in vegas , and we got drunk .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=246> i &apos;m sorry , is this the same rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=247> yeah , but i don &apos;t love her .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=248> that &apos;s better .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=249> this was just a drunken mistake , and i need to get it annulled . i see .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=250> have you considered therapy ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=251> i think just the annulment for today .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=252> there are some forms to fill out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=253> it &apos;s easy .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=254> we &apos;ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=255> it &apos;s no problem .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=256> we &apos;ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=257> there &apos;s no way to do this without her ? because i kind of already told her it was taken care of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=258> of course you did .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=259> look , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=260> what about someone who looks like rachel ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=261> i will think about the therapy .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=262> so i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=263> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=264> no point in dragging it out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=265> dragging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=266> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=267> what about this ? who gets this ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=268> i don &apos;t know if i want it because it might be too many memories .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=269> what is that ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=270> i don &apos;t know .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=271> how about this ? i want you to have the big plate .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=272> wow , monica , thanks . i love this plate .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=273> something to remember me by .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=274> mon , you &apos;re not dying . i &apos;m just moving out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=275> we &apos;re gonna see each other all the time .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=276> but still , it &apos;s a big change.the end of an era , you might say .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=277> are you okay ? you &apos;re not blinking .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=278> i &apos;m fine . i was thinking about how it &apos;s an end of an era .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=279> oh , all right .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=280> but i gotta say , i don &apos;t think six years counts as an era .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=281> an era is defined as a significant period of time .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=282> it was significant for me . maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you !</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=283> @-@ what is the matter with you ?  @-@ what is the matter with you ? !</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=286> monica , all right . but don &apos;t get mad at me .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=287> it &apos;s just a little hard to believe . what &apos;s hard to believe ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=288> i mean , it &apos;s you guys . you do this kind of stuff , you know ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=289> you were gonna get married in vegas , and then you backed out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=290> i &apos;m not upset because i don &apos;t see you going through with it . i &apos;m sorry .</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=305> it &apos;s not that . annulments are more complicated ..</seg>

<seg id=52> boy stuff mostly ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=53> but he is so angry .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=54> although some of what he &apos;s being accused of is just persecution .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=55> they claim that he hung the petruzzos &apos; cat on their garage door ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=56> but it &apos;s totally unfounded .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=57> well , you know , in a way it &apos;s to be expected , with vito passing and all that that entrailed .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=58> i think the only solution is to move away</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=59> from that house and the kids at school .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=60> i figured it out ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=61> and i know it &apos;s a lot ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=62> but for 100,000 .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=63> we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=64> my friend cheryl lives in orono , maine , by the university .</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=232> what ? are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=233> i mean , did we not have as much fun ?</seg>

<p>
<seg id=234> don &apos;t i deserve a few tears ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=235> when we told joey , he cried his eyes out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=236> i didn &apos;t cry my eyes out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=237> come on , it &apos;s like the end of an era . no more j @-@ man and channy &apos;s !</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=238> okay , i gotta ask , who calls us that ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=239> you &apos;re married again ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=240> yes .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=241> so that &apos;s your second marriage in two years ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=242> yeah . second in two years . third , overall .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=243> i &apos;ve been a divorce attorney for 23 years , and never have i had so much business from one client .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=244> why didn &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s going on ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=245> basically , rachel and i were in las vegas , and we got drunk ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=246> i &apos;m sorry , is this the same rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=247> yeah , but i don &apos;t love her .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=248> that &apos;s better .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=249> this was just a drunken mistake , and i need to get it annulled . i see .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=250> have you considered therapy ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=251> i think just the annulment for today .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=252> there are some forms to fill out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=253> it &apos;s simple .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=254> we &apos;ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=255> it &apos;s no problem .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=256> we &apos;ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=257> there &apos;s no way to do this without her ? because i kind of already told her it was taken care of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=258> of course you did .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=259> look , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=260> what about a guy who looks like rachel ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=261> i &apos;ll consider therapy .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=262> so i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=263> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=264> no point in dragging it out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=265> dragging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=266> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=267> what about this ? who gets this ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=268> i don &apos;t know if i want it because it might be too many memories .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=269> what &apos;s that ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=270> i don &apos;t know .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=271> how about this ? i want you to have the big plate .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=272> thank you . i love this plate .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=273> something to remember me by .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=274> mon , you &apos;re not dying . i &apos;m just moving out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=275> we &apos;re gonna see each other all the time .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=276> but still , it &apos;s a big change . the end of an era , you might say .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=277> are you okay ? you didn &apos;t even blink .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=278> i &apos;m fine . i was thinking about how it &apos;s an end of an era .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=279> okay .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=280> but i gotta say , i don &apos;t think six years counts as an era .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=281> an era is defined as a significant period of time .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=282> it was significant for me . maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you !</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=283> what &apos;s the matter with you ? what happened ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=284> why aren &apos;t you more upset ? aren &apos;t you gonna be sad that we &apos;re not living together ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=285> aren &apos;t you gonna miss me at all ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=286> monica , all right . but don &apos;t get mad at me .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=287> it &apos;s just a little hard to believe . what &apos;s hard to believe ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=288> i mean , it &apos;s you guys . you do this kind of stuff , you know ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=289> you were gonna get married in las vegas , and then you backed out .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=290> i &apos;m not sad because i don &apos;t see you going through with it . i &apos;m sorry .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=291> it &apos;s going to happen . chandler will move in here .</seg>
</p>

<seg id=51> a social worker ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=52> boy stuff mostly ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=53> but he &apos;s angry .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=54> although some of what he &apos;s being accused of is just persecution .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=55> they claim that he hung the petruzzos &apos; cat on their garage door ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=56> but it &apos;s totally unfounded .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=57> well , you know , in a way it &apos;s to be expected , with vito passing and all that that entrailed .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=58> i think the only way is to move away</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=59> from that house and the kids at school .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=60> i figured it out ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=61> and i know it &apos;s a lot ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=62> but for $ 100,000 .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=63> we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=64> my friend cheryl lives in orono , maine , by the university .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=65> by the university .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=66> and there &apos;s this two @-@ storey cape ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=67> with solid school .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=68> you always said if there &apos;s anything you could do ...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=69> of course .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=70> have you talked to his uncle ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=71> who ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=72> phil !</seg>

<p>
<seg id=73> phil &apos;s not his uncle . him and i are second cousins .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=74> before we get too drastic here</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=75> and uproot little vito and all of you</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=76> from your friends and your family ,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=77> i should talk to him . he &apos;s impossible to talk to .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=78> it &apos;s not easy to substitute for a father .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=79> i know .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=80> but maybe i can fill in here .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=81> fine , but you &apos;ll think about it ?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=82> trust me , i &apos;ll take care of you . he &apos;s gonna be fine .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=83> well ,</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=88> she should get him a puppy .</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=90> the point is , how the fuck is this my problem ?</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=95> now second time around i &apos;m getting my pocket picked .</seg>
