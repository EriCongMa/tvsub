hello , mrs. ross . woo @-@ hoo ! 
well , hello , mr. rachel . 
my god . 
come on , pheebs , hurry ! hurry , hurry , hurry.okay ! okay ! 
my god ! is everybody getting married ? 
no running in the chapel . 
don &apos;t you give me any of your hey ! 
hi . hey ! 
what are you guys doing here ? 
ross and rachel left us a message saying they were getting married ! 
isn &apos;t that why you guys are here to find them ? 
yes . well that @-@ yes . 
why else would we be here ? 
what happened ? did we miss it ? 
we actually missed it . 
well , maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had you run in the chapel ! 
this is insane . 
what &apos;s the big deal ? it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a real marriage . 
what ? 
if you marry in vegas , you &apos;re only married in vegas . 
what are you talking about ? 
if you get married in vegas you &apos;re married everywhere . 
really ? 
yeah . 
my god . 
oh , well . 
why are we in bed together ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
do you have any clothes on ? 
yes . 
really ? 
no . 
but we didn &apos;t have 
sex , did we ? 
i don &apos;t remember much about last night . 
it was such a blur . 
i remember laughing . i laughed a lot . 
then we didn &apos;t have sex . 
i mean , we were really drunk . 
i &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t do anything stupid . 
tell me about it . 
morning , pheebs . 
my movie has been officially canceled . 
i &apos;m so sorry . you want some of my breakfast ? 
no , i &apos;m too depressed to eat . 
i &apos;ll probably eat in , like , five minutes . 
so i guess i &apos;ll fly home with you guys . what time is your flight ? 
what about my cab ? 
i don &apos;t need it anymore . 
you borrowed my cab , you have to drive it back . 
i don &apos;t want to drive all the way back by myself , i get so lonely . 
how about if you come with me ? 
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a long trip . that would be great . 
we could talk and play games . 
this could be our chance to , like , renew our friendship . 
are you asking me to have a &quot; frienaissance &quot; ? 
sure ? 
all right , although i don &apos;t think we need one . 
baby.i never stopped loving you . 
hey . hey . 
so has anybody talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet ? 
they left me a message ; they should be here any minute . 
where is the waitress ? i &apos;m starving . 
it &apos;s a buffet . 
here &apos;s where i win all my money back ! 
i gotta talk to you . 
sure . what &apos;s up ? 
monica and i almost got married last night 
my god ! that &apos;s huge ! 
wait a minute . why wasn &apos;t i invited ? 
and who was gonna be your best man ? 
don &apos;t say ross . do not say ross . 
i just don &apos;t think we are ready to get married yet ! you know ? 
i mean , i love her and everything 
but seeing they coming out of that chape 
it was like a , like a wake @-@ up call that we are moving so fast . 
how do i tell her without crushing her heart ? 
you tell her she &apos;s not marriage material . 
what ? 
girls say it to me all the time . 
and believe me if she &apos;s anything like me , she &apos;s just gonna be relieved . 
how do i tell chandler that it &apos;s too soon . 
it &apos;s gonna break his heart , he &apos;s not gonna think that i don &apos;t love him anymore . 
yes , i do . 
you don &apos;t . 
good . i was just testing you . 
hey . oh , hi . 
we were just talking about bacon . 
no , we were talking about tennis.tennis is more believable . 
hey.hey. 
hi . thank you . 
coffee . 
what ? are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night ? 
what do you mean &quot; last night &quot; ? nothing , uh , happened last night . 
ross invited us all to watch . 
rach ! we weren &apos;t gonna miss our friends getting married ! 
who got married ? 
you did ? 
what ? 
we didn &apos;t get married . no , we didn &apos;t get married ! that &apos;s ridiculous ! 
i remember being in a chapel . 
they would not let us get married when we were that drunk . 
they let you get married when you &apos;re drunk ! most people who get married in vegas are drunk ! 
i &apos;m drunk right now . 
i can &apos;t have a mimosa with breakfast ? i &apos;m on vacation . 
what are you guys gonna do ? 
i guess we find a divorce lawyer . 
i think ross already has one . 
this one &apos;s free , right ? 
because you paid for the first two , third one free . 
laugh it up , but the joke &apos;s on you 
because we don &apos;t need to get divorced . we &apos;re just gonna get an annulment . 
an annulment ? 
ross , i don &apos;t think surgery can help you . 
that &apos;s your thing ! 
what ? 
your thing , you &apos;re the guy who gets divorced . 
oh , yeah . 
that &apos;s not &quot; my thing . &quot; 
i do not love getting divorced . 
yes , you do . this is your third divorce . 
you love divorce so much , you &apos;re probably gonna marry it 
and then it won &apos;t work out , so you &apos;re gonna have to divorce it , divorcing guy . 
i &apos;m so drunk . 
so , what do you think we should do ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
i know i love you . i know i love you . 
so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing ? i love you . 
that &apos;s a good question . 
last night we let the dice decide . 
we should leave it up to fate again . i love you ! 
we don &apos;t get married unless there &apos;s a sign . 
okay ? so say , 
you roll another eight , then there &apos;s a definite sign that we should get married . 
all right . eight we get married but others , we don &apos;t get married . 
sounds great . okay . 
we got a shooter . 
money , please . 
ready ? 
ready . 
come on , eight . 
yes , eight . 
eight , easy eight . 
wow ! i can &apos;t believe i actually rolled an eight . that was so unlikely . 
well , let us get married . i guess . 
that wasn &apos;t hard eight . last night i rolled a hard eight . 
that &apos;s right ! it was the wrong kind of eight , no wedding ! damn it ! 
i wanted it so bad ! 
wanna go pack ? 
yeah . 
we &apos;re doing the right thing , right ? 
of course we are ! we left it up to fate . 
if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear @-@ cut sign . 
okay , you have 19 questions left . use them wisely . 
come on . you can &apos;t win if you don &apos;t ask any questions ! 
what ? you promised me a fun road trip . 
we &apos;ve been on the road for 6 hours , and you &apos;ve been asleep for 5 and a half . 
we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back ! 
that will be your punishment , you greedy sleeper . 
all right . 
and until then , you are going to sing to me . 
because the radio &apos;s broken , and you are selfish , but you have a nice voice . 
really ? sing ! 
this is a long drive . 
are my eyes open ? 
no ! 
morning . 
hey , hubby . 
i wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing . 
i &apos;m not gonna do that . 
okay . 
so we &apos;ll just stay married . 
yes , exactly . 
and i will make everyone call me mrs. geller . 
this is so amazing . 
i , uh , really thought i &apos;d have to talk you into this more . 
now i &apos;m scared because i don &apos;t actually think you &apos;re kidding . 
i &apos;m not kidding . 
look , i 
i can &apos;t have three failed marriages . i can &apos;t , okay ? 
i am not gonna be that guy . 
so , we just stay married forever ? 
okay , how ? 
how is this going to affect you , really ? 
i mean , you fill some form out once in a while 
instead of checking the box &quot; miss , &quot; you check the box that says , &quot; mrs. &quot; 
it &apos;s right next to it . 
okay , i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right . we absolutely can stay married , 
because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other . 
all right . 
please take a moment here 
and think about what you &apos;re asking of me . 
i am asking you to do me a favor . 
you are asking me to be your wife . 
and , as my wife , i think you should grant me this favor . 
that kid really kicked me hard on the plane . 
well , you did pull his hair . 
he took my snack . i &apos;m not getting into this again . 
all right . hurts really bad . 
i told you not to walk . here . 
there . there . okay . 
this doesn &apos;t mean anything , does it ? 
no . 
how could you pick up a hitchhiker ? 
he could be a rapist or a killer or something . 
don &apos;t you think i asked him that before he got in ? 
i &apos;m not talking to you . you go back to sleep . 
are you a rapist ? 
no . 
do you like car games ? 
yeah , you know the , uh , license plate game ? 
i love the license plate game ! 
i &apos;ll play . i &apos;ll play . 
no , you need your sleep . night @-@ night . shh . 
hey . hey . 
listen . i know you wanted to talk to me 
but i have an idea that may make you wanna stay married . 
we register 
and you get to keep all the presents . 
no , ross . listen to me . 
i &apos;ve thought about how to tell you this 
the bottom line is we cannot stay married . 
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true . oh , but it is . 
you know what this is ? 
this is a difference of opinion . 
when that happens in a marriage . ross ! 
this is not a marriage ! this is the world &apos;s worst hangover ! 
if you do not get this annulment , i will . 
all right . i &apos;ll do it . 
thank you . 
is there any such thing as an annulment shower ? 
there &apos;s the train station , where i get off . 
i have your address and phone number . 
and i have your name and the fact that you &apos;re a drifter . 
so ball &apos;s pretty much in your court . 
all right . see you . 
come on , i can &apos;t take this any more . please talk to me . 
let me make it up to you , huh ? 
stop it ! 
that &apos;s not fair . you know i can &apos;t resist that beautiful voice . 
pheebs , i am so sorry . 
i promised you a fun road trip with your friend and i didn &apos;t deliver . 
now i know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship . 
so i will strive to stay awake for as long as i know you . 
you can still sleep at night and stuff . 
thank you . 
so can we play 20 questions now ? 
i &apos;ve got a really good one ! i &apos;ve been thinking about it since kansas . 
okay . 
is it a kind of hot sandwich ? 
yes . 
is it a meatball sub ? 
that is incredible ! 
you are the master ! 
bug ! 
that &apos;s funny . you look like you &apos;re 
don &apos;t say it ! don &apos;t even think it . 
all right . 
chandler , enjoy your handful . 
should we just get married ? 
all the signs are telling us to do it . 
i &apos;m sick of the signs . 
it &apos;s too fast . i &apos;m happy the way things are . 
me too . 
i don &apos;t want change , do you ? 
no . 
all right then , then nothing changes ! everything is great ! 
and you go unpack because it &apos;s been three days and it &apos;s driving me insane ! 
relax , it &apos;s not like we &apos;re marry . 
i was thinking , what if i unpack here ? 
all your stuff would be here . 
well what if all my stuff was here ? 
then you &apos;d be going back and forth all the time . 
doesn &apos;t make any sense . 
what if we live together , and you understand what i &apos;m saying ? 
live together ? 
there &apos;ve been no signs for that . 
me asking is kind of a sign . 
yes ! yes ! 
yes .

you know how much we love you . 
and you know we love having you around .

all right . 
this has gotta start showing results , or end . 
i talked to a business associate about these panic attacks . 
enough fucking around . enough money in your pocket . 
what &apos;s the story here ? 
the latest treatment of panic attack syndrome is a three @-@ part approach . 
it &apos;s a syndrome ? 
medication for depression , psychotherapy ... 
... and cognitive behavioral therapy . 
you &apos;re on medication . 
if you feel ready , you could see a behaviorist . 
you mean talk to somebody else ? 
you seem unhappy with my approach . 
if you &apos;re really ready to commit to mental health , i say great . 
let us get going , i &apos;m ready to help . 
but we &apos;ll have to delve deeper . focus . 
this latest incident , for our starters . 
all right . fine . 
my daughter brought home a black . 
they were on the couch , watching tv . they are snuggling . 
and ? 
she went upstairs , and i had a frank conversation with buckwheat . 
i told him to stay the fuck away from my daughter . 
and she came downstairs and they left . 
then you had the attack ? 
not right then . i went to the kitchen for a sandwich , i opened the cabinet ... 
... i saw a box of uncle ben &apos;s rice . boom ! 
i see . it &apos;s the rice logo . 
the first onset of hyperventilation , that occurred upon you seeing the rice ? 
no . i was taking the capocollo and shit out of the fridge . 
i &apos;m thinking when you first came here , the panic attacks with ducks ... 
... as i remember it , you were grilling meat , weren &apos;t you ? 
the memory on you . 
sausages , wasn &apos;t it ? 
sausages . steaks . yeah .

this is unacceptable . 
it &apos;s $ 4000 . i &apos;ll have the rest in a few days . 
i thought i made myself clear .

don &apos;t drag in our friendship . you work for me . 
i want to ...

anthony , what did i fucking tell you ? 
what , your father never cut off anybody &apos;s pinky ? 
that &apos;s traumatic 
for anyone to witness , much less an 11 @-@ year @-@ old . 
actually , it wasn &apos;t . 
it was a rush , if you want to know the truth . 
you want me to delve ? 
go on . 
dinner &apos;s ready . 
come here . 
come on , i wanna talk to you . 
what you seen today , anthony , a very sad thing . 
you disobeyed your old man , and i ought to give you the belt . 
but i gotta say that ... 
... a lot of boys your age would have run 
like a girl . but you stayed . 
i know you like mr. satriale . we all do . he &apos;s a lovely man . 
the man is a gambler . 
he got over his head in debt . he owed me money and refused to pay . 
he avoided me . 
that &apos;s why you should never gamble , anthony . 
what was i supposed to do ? 
这是我的生存之道that &apos;s my livelihood . 
it &apos;s how i put food on the table . 
you should never gamble , anthony . 
johnny , dinner &apos;s ready ! anthony ! janice , turn that off . 
let this be a lesson to you . 
a man honors his debts . 
beautiful cut he sent . 
you like it standing with the bone in , lee ? 
look at those juices . 
go , wayne newton . 
can i have the end piece ? 
johnny , let us eat while it &apos;s still hot . 
you bet , baby . the lady loves her meat . 
four stitches . ruined dinner . 
this was your first panic attack ? 
fainted , my old man called it . 
obviously , we &apos;ve finally touched on something here . 
what you witnessed that day . where the meat came from . 
and your mother &apos;s great pleasure in it . 
it was the one time she &apos;d be in a good mood ... 
... when the weekly delivery from satriale &apos;s came . 
or fusco , the vegetable man , maybe . 
probably the only time the old man got laid . 
probably . 
pretty sick , huh ? 
getting turned on by free cold cuts ? 
did your mother question why the meat was free ? 
meat that was going into her children &apos;s mouths ? 
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t wanna know . 
i don &apos;t wanna think about any of it . 
i &apos;m sure it was too much for you then too . that &apos;s why you short @-@ circuited . 
you are in your puberty . witnessing not only your mother and father &apos;s sexuality ... 
... but also the violence and blood so closely connected ... 
... to the food you were about to eat . 
and also , the thought that someday ... 
... you might be called upon to bring home the bacon . 
like your father . 
all this from a slice of capocollo ? 
kind of like proust &apos;s madeleines . 
what ? 
marcel proust . 
he wrote a seven @-@ volume classic , remembrance of things past . 
he took a bite of a madeleine . 
it &apos;s a kind of tea cookie he used to have as a child . 
and that one bite unleashed a tide of memories of his childhood ... 
... and ultimately of his entire life . 
this sounds very gay . i hope you &apos;re not saying that . 
no . 
understanding root causes makes you less vulnerable to future episodes . 
my fucking head is swimming here . 
we &apos;re gonna have to stop . it &apos;s a lot to process . 
but we &apos;ve made real progress today . good work . 
and i &apos;d really like you to write down any thoughts or associations . 
see the left tackle ? 
he fakes inside , and then gets a spin move on the guy . 
now he &apos;s charging the quarterback . see ? 
i thought the tailback had it . 
you gotta keep your eye on the ball . 
okay , i &apos;m going . 
where ? 
i gotta bring med her biking shoes , she &apos;s been missing my braciole . 
can i come ? 
hey , we &apos;re watching the game . 
i can catch the game in the car . 
it &apos;s nice he wants to visit his sister . 
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll get my shoes . 
why not watch your game ? 
what , i shouldn &apos;t go now ? 
a.j. , why don &apos;t you bring this stuff out to the car ? 
this is about sambo , right ? 
i &apos;m paying for that goddamn college . 
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . 
but if you want to make a scene ... 
... then comb your hair and come along . embarrass her . 
alienate her . or better yet , cut her off . 
let her drop out and go to a state school . or move back in here . 
i was just trying to protect her . and i &apos;ll do that till i die . 
i &apos;m not gonna tell you you can &apos;t come . she &apos;s your daughter . 
i &apos;ll probably watch the game . 
garcia handing off at the 40 @-@ yard line across to the 43 . 
garcia handing off at the 40 @-@ yard line across to the 43 . 
leave me the fuck alone . 
go for the touchdown . i need another five points to cover the spread . 
hi . pardon me . 
here she is . come on . meadow ! 
we &apos;re here . 
this is my mom and my brother , a.j. 
hey . 
dad didn &apos;t come ? 
no , he didn &apos;t . did you want him to ? 
noah , would you mind ? 
noah told me what dad said . 
it &apos;s out in the open , so fuck this . 
let us watch the latrine @-@ lip . 
oh , what &apos;d dad say ? 
anthony , wait for me downstairs . i want to talk to your sister . 
oh , i know what he said . 
go . 
i &apos;m always being sent away . why do i bother going anywhere ? 
what did your father say ? 
like he didn &apos;t tell you . 
believe what you like ... 
he called noah things so ugly ... 
... i can &apos;t even repeat it . 
you &apos;re right . there &apos;s no excuse . 
he &apos;s lucky i didn &apos;t punch him out . 
because you &apos;re civilized . 
so this was gonna be a big drama ? 
you wanted your father to subject your friend to this again ? 
wait . so i &apos;m in the wrong ? 
the rest of the world should work around ... 
... his racist , retrograde , fucking @-@ asshole personality ? 
he &apos;s from a place and a time where he thinks it &apos;s in your best interest . 
new jersey ? the third millennium ? 
noah , you know what i mean . 
you are coming from a racially @-@ mixed marriage and you must have been a burden . 
don &apos;t slam his background . look what you wound up in ! 
excuse us , noah . i want a word with my daughter . 
i &apos;m not going anywhere unless she wants me to . 
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll be up in a little while . 
i &apos;d hate to think you &apos;re airing family business in public . 
noah &apos;s not stupid . it took him a while , but he caught on . 
he keeps his opinions to himself . 
unlike some people , he &apos;s brilliant and sensitive . 
i &apos;ll keep my mouth shut . 
anything i say to you , or your father , will just fuel this . 
i &apos;m not gonna stop seeing noah . 
i put your helmet there . though i &apos;d rather you not bike in the city . 
if you must know , i &apos;m going to litchfield , connecticut ... 
... to the weekend home of noah &apos;s parents &apos; friends , who work at nbc . 
but hegel is talking about ... 
svetlana , get out here ! 
oh , hi . 
you must be the famous bill . moving day , huh ? 
i didn &apos;t think you would have the nerve to show your face to me . 
why ? what &apos;s wrong ? 
don &apos;t bullshit me . where is my leg ? 
your leg ? oh , yeah , where &apos;s your ... ? 
i know you took it . 
that &apos;s preposterous . how could i use it ? 
you think that will make me give records back , but you &apos;re wrong . 
if you see a karmic connection between my mother &apos;s records and your missing leg , wow ! 
the records return , and so does the leg . i see how you got there . 
how do you live with yourself ? 
bill , don &apos;t waste breath . 
this cunt is gonna be sorry she ever fuck with me . 
you better hope you have all your shit , &apos; cause i &apos;m calling the locksmith .

coffeehouse , shit . we were gonna jack a benefit concert there tonight . 
can you make it work without dino ? 
it was my fucking idea . 
i know this must be hard , anthony . 
your sister off at college , you all by yourself with us . 
but it won &apos;t be for long . 
soon , you &apos;ll be heading off to college yourself . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna go . 
college ? of course you will . 
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it right now . 
there &apos;s so many people , all smarter than me . a bunch of freaks .

you &apos;re not excused ! 
you &apos;re punished ! 
he &apos;s all right . lascia lui . 
move this car and your life will not be worth shit .

what &apos;s wrong with him ? when &apos;s he gonna grow up ?

here . 
guys , take a good look at soprano and remember his performance last week . 
he &apos;s on the sidelines three quarters , waiting . does his mind go soft ? 
no . does his fire go out ? heck , no . 
when the call came , he brought his a game . 
he may have a big future . he may be a leader . 
that &apos;s what it takes . and that &apos;s why i &apos;m naming him defensive captain . 
all right ! so let us hit those showers , one thought in mind ... 
soprano ! soprano , you all right ?
